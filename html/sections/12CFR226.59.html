                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule--(1) Evaluation of increased rate. If a card issuer increases an annual percentage rate that applies to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, based on the credit risk of the consumer, market conditions, or other factors, or increased such a rate on or after January 1, 2009, and 45 days' advance notice of the rate increase is required pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2) or (g), the card issuer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evaluate the factors described in paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on its review of such factors, reduce the annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's account, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate reductions--(i) Timing. If a card issuer is required to reduce the rate applicable to an account pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the card issuer must reduce the rate not later than 45 days after completion of the evaluation described in paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicability of rate reduction. Any reduction in an annual percentage rate required pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any outstanding balances to which the increased rate described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section has been applied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> New transactions that occur after the effective date of the rate reduction that would otherwise have been subject to the increased rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Policies and procedures. A card issuer must have reasonable written policies and procedures in place to conduct the review described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timing. A card issuer that is subject to paragraph (a) of this section must conduct the review described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section not less frequently than once every six months after the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Factors--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a card issuer must review either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The factors on which the increase in an annual percentage rate was originally based; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The factors that the card issuer currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010. For rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010, an issuer must consider the factors described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) when conducting the first two reviews required under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the rate increase subject to paragraph (a) of this section was based solely upon factors specific to the consumer, such as a decline in the consumer's credit risk, the consumer's delinquency or default, or a violation of the terms of the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rate increases subject to Sec. 226.55(b)(4). If an issuer increases a rate applicable to a consumer's account pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) based on the card issuer not receiving the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date, the issuer is not required to perform the review described in paragraph (a) of this section prior to the sixth payment due date after the effective date of the increase. However, if the annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's account is not reduced pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii), the card

issuer must perform the review described in paragraph (a) of this section. The first such review must occur no later than six months after the sixth payment due following the effective date of the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Termination of obligation to review factors. The obligation to review factors described in paragraph (a) and (d) of this section ceases to apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the issuer reduces the annual percentage rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan to the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase, or, if the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase was a variable rate, to a variable rate determined by the same formula (index and margin) that was used to calculate the rate applicable immediately prior to the increase; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the issuer reduces the annual percentage rate to a rate that is lower than the rate described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Acquired accounts--(1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to credit card accounts that have been acquired by the card issuer from another card issuer. A card issuer that complies with this section by reviewing the factors described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) must review the factors considered by the card issuer from which it acquired the accounts in connection with the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Review of acquired portfolio. If, not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, a card issuer reviews all of the credit card accounts it acquires in accordance with the factors that it currently considers in determining the rates applicable to its similar new credit card accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iii), the card issuer is required to conduct reviews described in paragraph (a) of this section only for rate increases that are imposed as a result of its review under this paragraph. See Sec. Sec. 226.9 and 226.55 for additional requirements regarding rate increases on acquired accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the card issuer is not required to conduct reviews in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section for any rate increases made prior to the card issuer's acquisition of such accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If as a result of the card issuer's review, an account is subject to, or continues to be subject to, an increased rate as a penalty, or due to the consumer's delinquency or default, the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions--(1) Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception. The requirements of this section do not apply to increases in an annual percentage rate that was previously decreased pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527, provided that such a rate increase is made in accordance with Sec. 226.55(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Charged off accounts. The requirements of this section do not apply to accounts that the card issuer has charged off in accordance with loan-loss provisions.

The term ``related person'' refers to, for example, a franchised or licensed seller of a creditor's product or service or a seller who assigns or sells sales accounts to a creditor or arranges for credit under a plan that allows the consumer to use the credit only in transactions with that seller. A seller is not related to the creditor merely because the seller and the creditor have an agreement authorizing the seller to honor the creditor's credit card.</p><p class="depth0">1.

(Where a portion of the finance charge is determined by application of one or more daily periodic rates, the phrase ``sum of the balances'' shall also mean the ``average of daily balances.'') In every case, the full amount of transactions subject to specific transaction charges shall be included in the denominator. Other balances or parts of balances shall be included according to the manner of determining the balance subject to a periodic rate, as illustrated in the following examples of accounts on monthly billing cycles:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ [Reserved]---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1. Previous balance--none.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction of $100 occurs on the first day of the billing cycle. The average daily balance is $100. A specific transaction charge of 3 percent is applicable to the specific transaction. The periodic rate is 1\1/2\ percent applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance charge, which is $4.50. The denominator is the amount of the transaction (which is $100), plus the amount by which the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the specific transactions (such excess in this case is 0), totaling $100.</p><p class="depth0">The annual percentage rate is the quotient (which is 4\1/2\ percent) multiplied by 12 (the number of months in a year), i.e., 54 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.

A specific transaction charge of 3 percent is applicable to the specific transaction. The periodic rate is 1\1/2\ percent applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance charge which is $5.25. The denominator is the amount of the transaction (which is $100), plus the amount by which the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the specific transaction (such excess in this case is $50), totaling $150. As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 3\1/2\ percent x 12 = 42 percent.</p><p class="depth0">3. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to the previous balance, the numerator is $4.50 and the denominator is $200 (the amount of the transaction, $100, plus the balance subject only to the periodic rate, the $100 previous balance). As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 2\1/4\ percent x 12 = 27 percent.</p><p class="depth0">4. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to an adjusted balance (previous balance less payments and credits) and the consumer made a payment of $50 at the midpoint of the billing cycle, the numerator is $3.75 and the denominator is $150 (the amount of the transaction, $100, plus the balance subject to the periodic rate, the $50 adjusted balance). As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 2\1/2\ percent x 12 = 30 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5.

periodic rate is 1\1/2\ percent applied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance charge, which is $2.50 and includes the $.25 check charge and the $2.25 resulting from the application of the periodic rate. The denominator is the full amount of the specific transaction (which is $100) plus the amount by which the average daily balance exceeds the amount of the specific transaction (which in this case is $50), totaling $150. As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate would be 1\2/3\ percent x 12 = 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0">6. Previous balance--none.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction of $100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing cycle. The average daily balance is $50. The specific transaction charge is 3 percent of the transaction amount or $3.00. The periodic rate is 1\1/2\ percent per month applied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the finance charge, which is $3.75, including the $3.00 transaction charge and $.75 resulting from application of the periodic rate. The denominator is the full amount of the specific transaction ($100) plus the amount by which the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the transaction ($0). Where the specific transaction amount exceeds the balance subject to the periodic rate, the resulting number is considered to be zero rather than a negative number ($50 - $100 = -$50). The denominator, in this case, is $100. As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 3\3/4\ percent x 12 = 45 percent.

For purposes of total annual loan cost disclosures, the term of a reverse mortgage transaction is assumed to begin on the first of the month in which consummation is expected to occur.

w = The number of unit-periods per year.I = wi x 100 = the nominal total annual loan cost rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> General equation. The total annual loan cost rate for a reverse mortgage transaction must be determined by first solving the following formula, which sets forth the relationship between the advances to the consumer and the amount owed to the creditor under the terms of the reverse mortgage agreement for the loan cost rate per unit-period (the loan cost rate per unit-period is then multiplied by the number of unit-periods per year to obtain the total annual loan cost rate I; that is, I = wi):[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24MR95.008</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Solution of general equation by iteration process.

If the consumer controls the timing of advances made after consummation (such as in a credit line arrangement), the creditor must use the general formula in paragraph (b)(7) of this appendix. The total annual loan cost rate shall be based on the assumption that 50 percent of the principal loan amount is advanced at closing, or in the case of an open-end transaction, at the time the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. Creditors shall assume the advances are made at the interest rate then in effect and that no further advances are made to, or repayments made by, the consumer during the term of the transaction or plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions.

[60 FR 15476, Mar. 24, 1995]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix M1 to Part 226--Repayment Disclosures</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. (1) ``Promotional terms'' means terms of a cardholder's account that will expire in a fixed period of time, as set forth by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Deferred interest or similar plan'' means a plan where a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on balances or transactions if those balances or transactions are paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculating minimum payment repayment estimates. (1) Minimum payment formulas. When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, card issuers must use the minimum payment formula(s) that apply to a cardholder's account. If more than one

minimum payment formula applies to an account, the issuer must apply each minimum payment formula to the portion of the balance to which the formula applies. In this case, the issuer must disclose the longest repayment period calculated. For example, assume that an issuer uses one minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for a general revolving feature, and another minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for special purchases, such as a ``club plan purchase.'' Also, assume that based on a consumer's balances in these features and the annual percentage rates that apply to such features, the repayment period calculated pursuant to this Appendix for the general revolving feature is 5 years, while the repayment period calculated for the special purchase feature is 3 years. This issuer must disclose 5 years as the repayment period for the entire balance to the consumer. If any promotional terms related to payments apply to a cardholder's account, such as a deferred billing plan where minimum payments are not required for 12 months, card issuers may assume no promotional terms apply to the account. For example, assume that a promotional minimum payment of $10 applies to an account for six months, and then after the promotional period expires, the minimum payment is calculated as 2 percent of the outstanding balance on the account or $20 whichever is greater. An issuer may assume during the promotional period that the $10 promotional minimum payment does not apply, and instead calculate the minimum payment disclosures based on the minimum payment formula of 2 percent of the outstanding balance or $20, whichever is greater. Alternatively, during the promotional period, an issuer in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate may apply the promotional minimum payment until it expires and then apply the minimum payment formula that applies after the promotional minimum payment expires. In the above example, an issuer could calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the promotional period by applying the $10 promotional minimum payment for the first six months and then applying the 2 percent or $20 (whichever is greater) minimum payment formula after the promotional minimum payment expires. In calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate during a promotional period, an issuer may not assume that the promotional minimum payment will apply until the outstanding balance is paid off by making only minimum payments (assuming the repayment estimate is longer than the promotional period). In the above example, the issuer may not calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the promotional period by assuming that the $10 promotional minimum payment will apply beyond the six months until the outstanding balance is repaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual percentage rate. When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, a card issuer must use the annual percentage rates that apply to a cardholder's account, based on the portion of the balance to which the rate applies. If any promotional terms related to annual percentage rates apply to a cardholder's account, other than deferred interest or similar plans, a card issuer in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate during the promotional period must apply the promotional annual percentage rate(s) until it expires and then must apply the rate that applies after the promotional rate(s) expires. If the rate that applies after the promotional rate(s) expires is a variable rate, a card issuer must calculate that rate based on the applicable index or formula. This variable rate is accurate if it was in effect within the last 30 days before the minimum payment repayment estimate is provided. For deferred interest plans or similar plans, if minimum payments under the deferred interest or similar plan will repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a card issuer must assume that the consumer will not be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the card issuer must apply a zero percent annual percentage rate to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan. If, however, minimum payments under the deferred interest plan or similar plan may not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a card issuer must assume that a consumer will not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time and thus the consumer will be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the card issuer must apply the annual percentage rate at which interest is accruing to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beginning balance. When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, a card issuer must use as the beginning balance the outstanding balance on a consumer's account as of the closing date of the last billing cycle. When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, a card issuer may round the beginning balance as described above to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assumptions. When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, a card issuer for each of the terms below, may either make the following assumption about that term, or use the account term that applies to a consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only minimum monthly payments are made each month. In addition, minimum

monthly payments are made each month--for example, a debt cancellation or suspension agreement, or skip payment feature does not apply to the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No additional extensions of credit are obtained, such as new purchases, transactions, fees, charges or other activity. No refunds or rebates are given.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The annual percentage rate or rates that apply to a cardholder's account will not change, through either the operation of a variable rate or the change to a rate, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this Appendix. For example, if a penalty annual percentage rate currently applies to a consumer's account, a card issuer may assume that the penalty annual percentage rate will apply to the consumer's account indefinitely, even if the consumer may potentially return to a non-penalty annual percentage rate in the future under the account agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is no grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The final payment pays the account in full (i.e., there is no residual finance charge after the final month in a series of payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The average daily balance method is used to calculate the balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> All months are the same length and leap year is ignored. A monthly or daily periodic rate may be assumed. If a daily periodic rate is assumed, the issuer may either assume (1) a year is 365 days long, and all months are 30.41667 days long, or (2) a year is 360 days long, and all months are 30 days long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Payments are credited either on the last day of the month or the last day of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Payments are allocated to lower annual percentage rate balances before higher annual percentage rate balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The account is not past due and the account balance does not exceed the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the assumed payments, current balance and interest charges for each month may be rounded to the nearest cent, as shown in Appendix M2 to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tolerance. A minimum payment repayment estimate shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate determined in accordance with the guidance in this Appendix (prior to rounding described in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B) and without use of the assumptions listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this Appendix to the extent a card issuer chooses instead to use the account terms that apply to a consumer's account). For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is 30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment repayment estimate should be disclosed as 2 years, due to the rounding rule set forth in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B). Nonetheless, based on the 30-month estimate, the issuer disclosed 3 years, based on that rounding rule. The issuer would be in compliance with this guidance by disclosing 3 years, instead of 2 years, because the issuer's estimate is within the 2 months' tolerance, prior to rounding. In addition, even if an issuer's estimate is more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix, so long as the issuer discloses the correct number of years to the consumer based on the rounding rule set forth in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B), the issuer would be in compliance with this guidance. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 32 months (2 years, 8 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is 38 months (3 years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule set forth in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B), both of these estimates would be rounded and disclosed to the consumer as 3 years. Thus, if the issuer disclosed 3 years to the consumer, the issuer would be in compliance with this guidance even though the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is outside the 2 months' tolerance amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculating the minimum payment total cost estimate. When calculating the minimum payment total cost estimate, a card issuer must total the dollar amount of the interest and principal that the consumer would pay if he or she made minimum payments for the length of time calculated as the minimum payment repayment estimate under paragraph (b) of this Appendix. The minimum payment total cost estimate is deemed to be accurate if it is based on a minimum payment repayment estimate that is within the tolerance guidance set forth in paragraph (b)(5) of this Appendix. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is 30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment total cost estimate will be deemed accurate even if it is based on the 30 month estimate for length of repayment, because the issuer's minimum payment repayment estimate is within the 2 months' tolerance, prior to rounding. In addition, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated under this Appendix is 32 months (2 years, 8 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is 38 months (3 years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule set forth in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B), both of these estimates

would be rounded and disclosed to the consumer as 3 years. If the issuer based the minimum payment total cost estimate on 38 months (or any other minimum payment repayment estimate that would be rounded to 3 years), the minimum payment total cost estimate would be deemed to be accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months. (1) In general. When calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, a card issuer must calculate the estimated monthly payment amount that would be required to pay off the outstanding balance shown on the statement within 36 months, assuming the consumer paid the same amount each month for 36 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Weighted annual percentage rate. In calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, an issuer may use a weighted annual percentage rate that is based on the annual percentage rates that apply to a cardholder's account and the portion of the balance to which the rate applies, as shown in Appendix M2 to this part. If a card issuer uses a weighted annual percentage rate and any promotional terms related to annual percentage rates apply to a cardholder's account, other than deferred interest plans or similar plans, in calculating the weighted annual percentage rate, the issuer must calculate a weighted average of the promotional rate and the rate that will apply after the promotional rate expires based on the percentage of 36 months each rate will apply, as shown in Appendix M2 to this part. For deferred interest plans or similar plans, if minimum payments under the deferred interest or similar plan will repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, if a card issuer uses a weighted annual percentage rate, the card issuer must assume that the consumer will not be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the weighted annual percentage rate, the card issuer must apply a zero percent annual percentage rate to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan. If, however, minimum payments under the deferred interest plan or similar plan may not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a card issuer in calculating the weighted annual percentage rate must assume that a consumer will not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time and thus the consumer will be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the weighted annual percentage rate, the card issuer must apply the annual percentage rate at which interest is accruing to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan. A card issuer may use a method of calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months other than a weighted annual percentage rate, so long as the calculation results in the same payment amount each month and so long as the total of the payments would pay off the outstanding balance shown on the periodic statement within 36 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assumptions. In calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, a card issuer must use the same terms described in paragraph (b) of this Appendix, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tolerance. An estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 10 percent above or below the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months determined in accordance with the guidance in this Appendix (after rounding described in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(F)(1)(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculating the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months. When calculating the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months, a card issuer must total the dollar amount of the interest and principal that the consumer would pay if he or she made the estimated monthly payment calculated under paragraph (d) of this appendix each month for 36 months. The total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months shall be considered accurate if it is based on the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months that is calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Calculating the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months. When calculating the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months, if a card issuer chooses under Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) to round the disclosures to the nearest whole dollar when disclosing them on the periodic statement, the card issuer must calculate the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months by subtracting the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months calculated under paragraph (e) of this appendix (rounded to the nearest whole dollar) from the minimum payment total cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of this appendix (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). If a card issuer chooses under Sec. 227.7(b)(12)(i), however, to round the disclosures to the nearest cent when disclosing them on the periodic statement, the card issuer must calculate the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months by subtracting the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months calculated under paragraph (e) of this appendix (rounded to the nearest cent) from the minimum payment total cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of this appendix (rounded to the nearest cent). The savings estimate for repayment in 36 months shall be considered accurate if it is based on the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months that is calculated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this appendix and the minimum payment

total cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of this appendix.

This commentary is the vehicle by which the staff of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs of the Federal Reserve Board issues official staff interpretations of Regulation Z. Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act. Section 130(f) (15 U.S.C. 1640) protects creditors from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any interpretation issued by a duly authorized official or employee of the Federal Reserve System.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure for requesting interpretations. Under appendix C of the regulation, anyone may request an official staff interpretation. Interpretations that are adopted will be incorporated in this commentary following publication in the Federal Register. No official staff interpretations are expected to be issued other than by means of this commentary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rules of construction. (a) Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as ``including, but not limited to,'' ``among other things,'' ``for example,'' or ``such as.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Throughout the commentary, reference to ``this section'' or ``this paragraph'' means the section or paragraph in the regulation that is the subject of the comment.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Foreign applicability. Regulation Z applies to all persons (including branches of foreign banks and sellers located in the United States) that extend consumer credit to residents (including resident aliens) of any state as defined in Sec. 226.2. If an account is located in the United States and credit is extended to a U.S. resident, the transaction is subject to the regulation. This will be the case whether or not a particular advance or purchase on the account takes place in the United States and whether or not the extender of credit is chartered or based in the United States or a foreign country. For example, if a U.S. resident has a credit card account located in the consumer's state issued by a bank (whether U.S. or foreign-based), the account is covered by the regulation, including extensions of credit under the account that occur outside the United States. In contrast, if a U.S. resident residing or visiting abroad, or a foreign national abroad, opens a credit card account issued by a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, the account is not covered by the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">1(d) Organization.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1.

The Board's amendments to Regulation Z published on May 19, 2009 apply to covered loans (including refinance loans and assumptions considered new transactions under Sec. 226.20) for which the creditor receives an application on or after July 30, 2009.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Effective dates.</p><p class="depth0">i. The Board's revisions published on July 30, 2008 (the ``final rules'') apply to covered loans (including refinance loans and assumptions considered new transactions under Sec. 226.20) for which the creditor receives an application on or after October 1, 2009, except for the final rules on advertising, escrows, and loan servicing. But see comment 1(d)(3)-1. The final rules on escrow in Sec. 226.35(b)(3) are effective for covered loans (including refinancings and assumptions in Sec. 226.20) for which the creditor receives an application on or after April 1, 2010; but for such loans secured by manufactured housing on or after October 1, 2010. The final rules applicable to servicers in Sec. 226.36(c) apply to all covered loans serviced on or after October 1, 2009. The final rules on advertising apply to advertisements occurring on or after October 1, 2009. For example, a radio ad occurs on the date it is first broadcast; a solicitation occurs on the date it is mailed to the consumer. The following examples illustrate the application of the effective dates for the final rules.</p><p class="depth0">A. General. A refinancing or assumption as defined in Sec. 226.20(a) or (b) is a new transaction and is covered by a provision of the final rules if the creditor receives an application for the transaction on or after that provision's effective date. For example, if a creditor receives an application for a refinance loan covered by Sec. 226.35(a) on or after October 1, 2009, and the refinance loan is consummated on October 15, 2009, the provision restricting prepayment penalties in Sec. 226.35(b)(2) applies. However, if the transaction were a modification of an existing obligation's terms that does not constitute a refinance loan under Sec. 226.20(a), the final rules, including for example the restriction on prepayment penalties, would not apply.</p><p class="depth0">B. Escrows. Assume a consumer applies for a refinance loan to be secured by a dwelling (that is not a manufactured home) on March 15, 2010, and the loan is consummated on April 2, 2010. The escrow rule in Sec. 226.35(b)(3) does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">C. Servicing. Assume that a consumer applies for a new loan on August 1, 2009. The loan is consummated on September 1, 2009. The servicing rules in Sec. 226.36(c) apply to the servicing of that loan as of October 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interim final rule on appraisal independence in Sec. 226.42 published on October 28, 2010 is mandatory on April 1, 2011, for open- and closed-end extensions of consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Section 226.36(b), which is substantially similar to Sec. 226.42(b) and (e), is removed effective April 1, 2011. Applications for closed-end extensions of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling that are received by creditors before April 1, 2011, are subject to Sec. 226.36(b) regardless of the date on which the transaction is consummated. However, parties subject to Sec. 226.36(b) may, at their option, choose to comply with Sec. 226.42 instead of Sec. 226.36(b), for applications received before April 1, 2011. Thus, an application for a closed-end extension of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling that is received by a creditor on March 20, 2011, and consummated on May 1, 2011, is subject to Sec. 226.36(b), however, the creditor may choose to comply with Sec. 226.42 instead. For an application for open- or closed-end credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling that is received on or after April 1, 2011, the creditor must comply with Sec. 226.42.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The final rule revising escrow requirements under Sec. 226.35(b)(3) published on March 2, 2011 applies to certain closed-end extensions of consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. See Sec. 226.35(a). Covered transactions for which an application is received by a creditor on or after April 1, 2011 are subject to Sec. 226.35(b)(3), as revised.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mandatory compliance dates. Compliance with the Board's revisions to Regulation Z published on August 14, 2009 is mandatory for private education loans for which the creditor receives an application on or after February 14, 2010. Compliance with the final rules on co-branding in Sec. Sec. 226.48(a) and (b) is mandatory for marketing occurring on or after February 14, 2010. Compliance with the final rules is optional for private education loan transactions for which an application was received prior to February 14, 2010, even if consummated after the mandatory compliance date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Optional compliance. A creditor may, at its option, provide the approval and final disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 226.47(b) or (c) for private education loans where an application was received prior to the mandatory compliance date. If the creditor opts to provide the disclosures, the creditor must also comply with the applicable timing and other rules in Sec. Sec. 226.46 and 226.48 (including providing the consumer with the 30-day acceptance period under Sec. 226.48(c), and the right to cancel under Sec. 226.48(d)). For example if the creditor receives an application on January 25, 2010 and approves the consumer's application on or after February 14, 2010, the creditor may, at its option, provide the approval disclosures under Sec. 226.47(b), the final disclosures under Sec. 226.47(c) and comply with the applicable requirements Sec. Sec. 226.46 and 226.48. The creditor must also obtain the self-certification form as required in Sec. 226.48(e), if applicable. Or, for example, if the creditor receives an application on January 25, 2010 and approves the consumer's application before February 14, 2010, the creditor may, at its option, provide the final disclosure under Sec. 226.47(c) and comply with the applicable timing and other requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.46 and 226.48, including providing the consumer with the right to cancel under Sec. 226.48(d). The creditor must also obtain the self-certification form as required in Sec. 226.48(e), if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0">1. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.2--Definitions and Rules of Construction</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(2) Advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Only commercial messages that promote consumer credit transactions requiring disclosures are advertisements. Messages inviting, offering, or otherwise announcing generally to prospective customers the availability of credit transactions, whether in visual, oral, or print media, are covered by Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226).</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Messages in a newspaper, magazine, leaflet, promotional flyer, or catalog.</p><p class="depth0">B. Announcements on radio, television, or public address system.</p><p class="depth0">C. Electronic advertisements, such as on the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">D. Direct mail literature or other printed material on any exterior or interior sign.</p><p class="depth0">E. Point of sale displays.</p><p class="depth0">F. Telephone solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">G. Price tags that contain credit information.</p><p class="depth0">H. Letters sent to customers or potential customers as part of an organized solicitation of business.</p><p class="depth0">I. Messages on checking account statements offering auto loans at a stated annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">J. Communications promoting a new open-end plan or closed-end transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The term does not include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Direct personal contacts, such as follow-up letters, cost estimates for individual consumers, or oral or written communication relating to the negotiation of a specific transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Informational material, for example, interest-rate and loan-term memos, distributed only to business entities.</p><p class="depth0">C. Notices required by federal or state law, if the law mandates that specific information be displayed and only the information so mandated is included in the notice.</p><p class="depth0">D. News articles the use of which is controlled by the news medium.</p><p class="depth0">E. Market-research or educational materials that do not solicit business.</p><p class="depth0">F. Communications about an existing credit account (for example, a promotion encouraging additional or different uses of an existing credit card account).</p><p class="depth0">2. Persons covered. All persons must comply with the advertising provisions in Sec. Sec. 226.16 and 226.24, not just those that meet the definition of creditor in Sec. 226.2(a)(17). Thus, home builders, merchants, and others who are not themselves creditors must comply with the advertising provisions of the regulation if they advertise consumer credit transactions. However, under section 145 of the act, the owner and the personnel of the medium in which an advertisement appears, or through which it is disseminated, are not subject to civil liability for violations.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(3) Reserved.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(4) Billing cycle or cycle.</p><p class="depth0">1. Intervals. In open-end credit plans, the billing cycle determines the intervals for which periodic disclosure statements are required; these intervals are also used as measuring points for other duties of the creditor. Typically, billing cycles are monthly, but they may be more frequent or less frequent (but not less frequent than quarterly).</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditors that do not bill. The term cycle is interchangeable with billing cycle for definitional purposes, since some creditors' cycles do not involve the sending of bills in the traditional sense but only statements of account activity. This is commonly the case with financial institutions when periodic payments are made through payroll deduction or through automatic debit of the consumer's asset account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Equal cycles. Although cycles must be equal, there is a permissible variance to account for weekends, holidays, and differences in the number of days in months. If the actual date of each statement does not vary by more than four days from a fixed ``day'' (for example, the third Thursday of each month) or ``date'' (for example, the 15th of each month) that the creditor regularly uses, the intervals between statements are considered equal. The requirement that cycles be equal applies even if the creditor applies a daily periodic rate to determine the finance charge. The requirement that intervals be equal does not apply to the first billing cycle on an open-end account (i.e., the time period between account opening and the generation of the first periodic statement) or to a transitional billing cycle that can occur if the creditor occasionally changes its billing cycles so as to establish a new statement day or date. (See comments 9(c)(1)-3 and 9(c)(2)-3.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Payment reminder. The sending of a regular payment reminder (rather than a late payment notice) establishes a cycle for which the creditor must send periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(6) Business day.</p><p class="depth0">1. Business function test. Activities that indicate that the creditor is open for substantially all of its business functions include the availability of personnel to make loan disbursements, to open new accounts, and to handle credit transaction inquiries. Activities that indicate that the creditor is not open for substantially all of its business functions include a retailer's merely accepting credit cards for purchases or a bank's having its customer-service windows open only for limited purposes such as deposits and withdrawals, bill paying, and related services.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rule for rescission, disclosures for certain mortgage transactions, and private education loans. A more precise rule for what is a business day (all calendar days except Sundays and the Federal legal holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) applies when the right of rescission, the receipt of disclosures for certain dwelling-secured mortgage transactions under Sec. Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(ii), 226.19(a)(2), 226.31(c), or the receipt of disclosures for private education loans under Sec. 226.46(d)(4) is involved. Four Federal legal holidays are identified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) by a specific date: New Year's Day, January 1; Independence Day, July 4; Veterans Day, November 11; and Christmas Day, December 25. When one of these holidays (July 4, for example) falls on a Saturday, Federal offices and other entities might observe the holiday on the preceding Friday (July 3). In cases where the more precise rule applies, the observed holiday (in the example, July 3) is a business day.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(7) Card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Agent. An agent of a card issuer is considered a card issuer. Because agency relationships are traditionally defined by contract and by state or other applicable law, the regulation does not define agent. Merely providing services relating to the production of credit cards or data processing for others, however, does not make one the agent of the card issuer. In contrast, a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(8) Cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. A cardholder is a natural person at whose request a card is issued for consumer credit purposes or who is a co-obligor or guarantor for such a card issued to another. The second category does not include an employee who is a co-obligor or guarantor

on a card issued to the employer for business purposes, nor does it include a person who is merely the authorized user of a card issued to another.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limited application of regulation. For the limited purposes of the rules on issuance of credit cards and liability for unauthorized use, a cardholder includes any person, including an organization, to whom a card is issued for any purpose--including a business, agricultural, or commercial purpose.</p><p class="depth0">3. Issuance. See the commentary to Sec. 226.12(a).</p><p class="depth0">4. Dual-purpose cards and dual-card systems. Some card issuers offer dual-purpose cards that are for business as well as consumer purposes. If a card is issued to an individual for consumer purposes, the fact that an organization has guaranteed to pay the debt does not make it business credit. On the other hand, if a card is issued for business purposes, the fact that an individual sometimes uses it for consumer purchases does not subject the card issuer to the provisions on periodic statements, billing-error resolution, and other protections afforded to consumer credit. Some card issuers offer dual-card systems--that is, they issue two cards to the same individual, one intended for business use, the other for consumer or personal use. With such a system, the same person may be a cardholder for general purposes when using the card issued for consumer use, and a cardholder only for the limited purposes of the restrictions on issuance and liability when using the card issued for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(9) Cash price.</p><p class="depth0">1. Components. This amount is a starting point in computing the amount financed and the total sale price under Sec. 226.18 for credit sales. Any charges imposed equally in cash and credit transactions may be included in the cash price, or they may be treated as other amounts financed under Sec. 226.18(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Service contracts. Service contracts include contracts for the repair or the servicing of goods, such as mechanical breakdown coverage, even if such a contract is characterized as insurance under state law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rebates. The creditor has complete flexibility in the way it treats rebates for purposes of disclosure and calculation. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.18(b).)</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(10) Closed-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The coverage of this term is defined by exclusion. That is, it includes any credit arrangement that does not fall within the definition of open-end credit. Subpart C contains the disclosure rules for closed-end credit when the obligation is subject to a finance charge or is payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(11) Consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Guarantors, endorsers, and sureties are not generally consumers for purposes of the regulation, but they may be entitled to rescind under certain circumstances and they may have certain rights if they are obligated on credit card plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rescission rules. For purposes of rescission under Sec. Sec. 226.15 and 226.23, a consumer includes any natural person whose ownership interest in his or her principal dwelling is subject to the risk of loss. Thus, if a security interest is taken in A's ownership interest in a house and that house is A's principal dwelling, A is a consumer for purposes of rescission, even if A is not liable, either primarily or secondarily, on the underlying consumer credit transaction. An ownership interest does not include, for example, leaseholds or inchoate rights, such as dower.</p><p class="depth0">3. Land trusts. Credit extended to land trusts, as described in the commentary to Sec. 226.3(a), is considered to be extended to a natural person for purposes of the definition of consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(12) Consumer credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Primary purpose. There is no precise test for what constitutes credit offered or extended for personal, family, or household purposes, nor for what constitutes the primary purpose. (See, however, the discussion of business purposes in the commentary to Sec. 226.3(a).)</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(13) Consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1. State law governs. When a contractual obligation on the consumer's part is created is a matter to be determined under applicable law; Regulation Z does not make this determination. A contractual commitment agreement, for example, that under applicable law binds the consumer to the credit terms would be consummation. Consummation, however, does not occur merely because the consumer has made some financial investment in the transaction (for example, by paying a nonrefundable fee) unless, of course, applicable law holds otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credit v. sale. Consummation does not occur when the consumer becomes contractually committed to a sale transaction, unless the consumer also becomes legally obligated to accept a particular credit arrangement. For example, when a consumer pays a nonrefundable deposit to purchase an automobile, a purchase contract may be created, but consummation for purposes of the regulation does not occur unless the consumer also contracts for financing at that time.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(14) Credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Exclusions. The following situations are not considered credit for purposes of the regulation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Layaway plans, unless the consumer is contractually obligated to continue making payments. Whether the consumer is so obligated is a matter to be determined under applicable law. The fact that the consumer is not entitled to a refund of any amounts paid towards the cash price of the merchandise does not bring layaways within the definition of credit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Tax liens, tax assessments, court judgments, and court approvals of reaffirmation of debts in bankruptcy. However, third-party financing of such obligations (for example, a bank loan obtained to pay off a tax lien) is credit for purposes of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Insurance premium plans that involve payment in installments with each installment representing the payment for insurance coverage for a certain future period of time, unless the consumer is contractually obligated to continue making payments.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Home improvement transactions that involve progress payments, if the consumer pays, as the work progresses, only for work completed and has no contractual obligation to continue making payments.</p><p class="depth0">v. Borrowing against the accrued cash value of an insurance policy or a pension account, if there is no independent obligation to repay.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Letters of credit.</p><p class="depth0">vii. The execution of option contracts. However, there may be an extension of credit when the option is exercised, if there is an agreement at that time to defer payment of a debt.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Investment plans in which the party extending capital to the consumer risks the loss of the capital advanced. This includes, for example, an arrangement with a home purchaser in which the investor pays a portion of the downpayment and of the periodic mortgage payments in return for an ownership interest in the property, and shares in any gain or loss of property value.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Mortgage assistance plans administered by a government agency in which a portion of the consumer's monthly payment amount is paid by the agency. No finance charge is imposed on the subsidy amount, and that amount is due in a lump-sum payment on a set date or upon the occurrence of certain events. (If payment is not made when due, a new note imposing a finance charge may be written, which may then be subject to the regulation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Payday loans; deferred presentment. Credit includes a transaction in which a cash advance is made to a consumer in exchange for the consumer's personal check, or in exchange for the consumer's authorization to debit the consumer's deposit account, and where the parties agree either that the check will not be cashed or deposited, or that the consumer's deposit account will not be debited, until a designated future date. This type of transaction is often referred to as a ``payday loan'' or ``payday advance'' or ``deferred-presentment loan.'' A fee charged in connection with such a transaction may be a finance charge for purposes of Sec. 226.4, regardless of how the fee is characterized under state law. Where the fee charged constitutes a finance charge under Sec. 226.4 and the person advancing funds regularly extends consumer credit, that person is a creditor and is required to provide disclosures consistent with the requirements of Regulation Z. (See Sec. 226.2(a)(17).)</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(15) Credit card.</p><p class="depth0">1. Usable from time to time. A credit card must be usable from time to time. Since this involves the possibility of repeated use of a single device, checks and similar instruments that can be used only once to obtain a single credit extension are not credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. Examples of credit cards include</p><p class="depth0">A. A card that guarantees checks or similar instruments, if the asset account is also tied to an overdraft line or if the instrument directly accesses a line of credit.</p><p class="depth0">B. A card that accesses both a credit and an asset account (that is, a debit-credit card).</p><p class="depth0">C. An identification card that permits the consumer to defer payment on a purchase.</p><p class="depth0">D. An identification card indicating loan approval that is presented to a merchant or to a lender, whether or not the consumer signs a separate promissory note for each credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">E. A card or device that can be activated upon receipt to access credit, even if the card has a substantive use other than credit, such as a purchase-price discount card. Such a card or device is a credit card notwithstanding the fact that the recipient must first contact the card issuer to access or activate the credit feature.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, credit card does not include, for example</p><p class="depth0">A. A check-guarantee or debit card with no credit feature or agreement, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent overdraft.</p><p class="depth0">B. Any card, key, plate, or other device that is used in order to obtain petroleum products for business purposes from a wholesale distribution facility or to gain access to that facility, and that is required to be used without regard to payment terms.</p><p class="depth0">C. An account number that accesses a credit account, unless the account number can access an open-end line of credit to purchase goods or services. For example, if a creditor provides a consumer with an open-end line of credit that can be accessed by an account number in order to transfer funds into another account (such as an asset account with the same creditor), the account number is not a credit card for purposes of Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(i). However, if the account number can also access the line of credit to purchase goods or services (such as an account number that can be used to purchase goods or services on the Internet), the account number is a credit card for purposes of Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(i), regardless of whether the creditor treats such transactions as purchases, cash advances, or some other type of transaction. Furthermore, if the line of credit can also be accessed by a card (such as a

debit card), that card is a credit card for purposes of Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Charge card. Generally, charge cards are cards used in connection with an account on which outstanding balances cannot be carried from one billing cycle to another and are payable when a periodic statement is received. Under the regulation, a reference to credit cards generally includes charge cards. In particular, references to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan in Subparts B and G generally include charge cards. The term charge card is, however, distinguished from credit card or credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan in Sec. Sec. 226.5a, 226.6(b)(2)(xiv), 226.7(b)(11), 226.7(b)(12), 226.9(e), 226.9(f), 226.28(d), 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), and appendices G-10 through G-13.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. An open-end consumer credit account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan for purposes of Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(ii) if</p><p class="depth0">i. The account is accessed by a credit card, as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(i); and</p><p class="depth0">ii. The account is not excluded under Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(ii)(A) or (a)(15)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(16) Credit sale.</p><p class="depth0">1. Special disclosure. If the seller is a creditor in the transaction, the transaction is a credit sale and the special credit sale disclosures (that is, the disclosures under Sec. 226.18(j)) must be given. This applies even if there is more than one creditor in the transaction and the creditor making the disclosures is not the seller. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(d).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Sellers who arrange credit. If the seller of the property or services involved arranged for financing but is not a creditor as to that sale, the transaction is not a credit sale. Thus, if a seller assists the consumer in obtaining a direct loan from a financial institution and the consumer's note is payable to the financial institution, the transaction is a loan and only the financial institution is a creditor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Refinancings. Generally, when a credit sale is refinanced within the meaning of Sec. 226.20(a), loan disclosures should be made. However, if a new sale of goods or services is also involved, the transaction is a credit sale.</p><p class="depth0">4. Incidental sales. Some lenders sell a product or service--such as credit, property, or health insurance--as part of a loan transaction. Section 226.4 contains the rules on whether the cost of credit life, disability or property insurance is part of the finance charge. If the insurance is financed, it may be disclosed as a separate credit-sale transaction or disclosed as part of the primary transaction; if the latter approach is taken, either loan or credit-sale disclosures may be made. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1) for further discussion of this point.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Credit extensions for educational purposes. A credit extension for educational purposes in which an educational institution is the creditor may be treated as either a credit sale or a loan, regardless of whether the funds are given directly to the student, credited to the student's account, or disbursed to other persons on the student's behalf. The disclosure of the total sale price need not be given if the transaction is treated as a loan.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(17) Creditor.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The definition contains four independent tests. If any one of the tests is met, the person is a creditor for purposes of that particular test.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prerequisites. This test is composed of two requirements, both of which must be met in order for a particular credit extension to be subject to the regulation and for the credit extension to count towards satisfaction of the numerical tests mentioned in Sec. 226.2(a)(17)(v).</p><p class="depth0">i. First, there must be either or both of the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. A written (rather than oral) agreement to pay in more than four installments. A letter that merely confirms an oral agreement does not constitute a written agreement for purposes of the definition.</p><p class="depth0">B. A finance charge imposed for the credit. The obligation to pay the finance charge need not be in writing.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, the obligation must be payable to the person in order for that person to be considered a creditor. If an obligation is made payable to bearer, the creditor is the one who initially accepts the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assignees. If an obligation is initially payable to one person, that person is the creditor even if the obligation by its terms is simultaneously assigned to another person. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. An auto dealer and a bank have a business relationship in which the bank supplies the dealer with credit sale contracts that are initially made payable to the dealer and provide for the immediate assignment of the obligation to the bank. The dealer and purchaser execute the contract only after the bank approves the creditworthiness of the purchaser. Because the obligation is initially payable on its face to the dealer, the dealer is the only creditor in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Numerical tests. The examples below illustrate how the numerical tests of Sec. 226.2(a)(17)(v) are applied. The examples assume that consumer credit with a finance charge or written agreement for more than 4 installments was extended in the years in question and that the person did not extend such credit in 2006.</p><p class="depth0">4. Counting transactions. For purposes of closed-end credit, the creditor counts each credit transaction. For open-end credit,

transactions means accounts, so that outstanding accounts are counted instead of individual credit extensions. Normally the number of transactions is measured by the preceding calendar year; if the requisite number is met, then the person is a creditor for all transactions in the current year. However, if the person did not meet the test in the preceding year, the number of transactions is measured by the current calendar year. For example, if the person extends consumer credit 26 times in 2007, it is a creditor for purposes of the regulation for the last extension of credit in 2007 and for all extensions of consumer credit in 2008. On the other hand, if a business begins in 2007 and extends consumer credit 20 times, it is not a creditor for purposes of the regulation in 2007. If it extends consumer credit 75 times in 2008, however, it becomes a creditor for purposes of the regulation (and must begin making disclosures) after the 25th extension of credit in that year and is a creditor for all extensions of consumer credit in 2009.</p><p class="depth0">5. Relationship between consumer credit in general and credit secured by a dwelling. Extensions of credit secured by a dwelling are counted towards the 25-extensions test. For example, if in 2007 a person extends unsecured consumer credit 23 times and consumer credit secured by a dwelling twice, it becomes a creditor for the succeeding extensions of credit, whether or not they are secured by a dwelling. On the other hand, extensions of consumer credit not secured by a dwelling are not counted towards the number of credit extensions secured by a dwelling. For example, if in 2007 a person extends credit not secured by a dwelling 8 times and credit secured by a dwelling 3 times, it is not a creditor.</p><p class="depth0">6. Effect of satisfying one test. Once one of the numerical tests is satisfied, the person is also a creditor for the other type of credit. For example, in 2007 a person extends consumer credit secured by a dwelling 5 times. That person is a creditor for all succeeding credit extensions, whether they involve credit secured by a dwelling or not.</p><p class="depth0">7. Trusts. In the case of credit extended by trusts, each individual trust is considered a separate entity for purposes of applying the criteria. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A bank is the trustee for three trusts. Trust A makes 15 extensions of consumer credit annually; Trust B makes 10 extensions of consumer credit annually; and Trust C makes 30 extensions of consumer credit annually. Only Trust C is a creditor for purposes of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(ii). [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuers subject to Subpart B. Section 226.2(a)(17)(iii) makes certain card issuers creditors for purposes of the open-end credit provisions of the regulation. This includes, for example, the issuers of so-called travel and entertainment cards that expect repayment at the first billing and do not impose a finance charge. Since all disclosures are to be made only as applicable, such card issuers would omit finance charge disclosures. Other provisions of the regulation regarding such areas as scope, definitions, determination of which charges are finance charges, Spanish language disclosures, record retention, and use of model forms, also apply to such card issuers.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuers subject to Subparts B and C. Section 226.2(a)(17)(iv) includes as creditors card issuers extending closed-end credit in which there is a finance charge or an agreement to pay in more than four installments. These card issuers are subject to the appropriate provisions of Subparts B and C, as well as to the general provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(18) Downpayment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Allocation. If a consumer makes a lump-sum payment, partially to reduce the cash price and partially to pay prepaid finance charges, only the portion attributable to reducing the cash price is part of the downpayment. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(23).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Pick-up payments. i. Creditors may treat the deferred portion of the downpayment, often referred to as pick-up payments, in a number of ways. If the pick-up payment is treated as part of the downpayment:</p><p class="depth0">A. It is subtracted in arriving at the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b).</p><p class="depth0">B. It may, but need not, be reflected in the payment schedule under Sec. 226.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the pick-up payment does not meet the definition (for example, if it is payable after the second regularly scheduled payment) or if the creditor chooses not to treat it as part of the downpayment:</p><p class="depth0">A. It must be included in the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">B. It must be shown in the payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Whichever way the pick-up payment is treated, the total of payments under Sec. 226.18(h) must equal the sum of the payments disclosed under Sec. 226.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of existing liens.</p><p class="depth0">i. No cash payment. In a credit sale, the ``downpayment'' may only be used to reduce the cash price. For example, when a trade-in is used as the downpayment and the existing lien on an automobile to be traded in exceeds the value of the automobile, creditors must disclose a zero on the downpayment line rather than a negative number. To illustrate, assume a consumer owes $10,000 on an existing automobile loan and that the trade-in value of the automobile is only $8,000, leaving a $2,000 deficit. The creditor should disclose a downpayment of $0, not -$2,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Cash payment. If the consumer makes a cash payment, creditors may, at their option, disclose the entire cash payment as the downpayment, or apply the cash payment

first to any excess lien amount and disclose any remaining cash as the downpayment. In the above example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If the downpayment disclosed is equal to the cash payment, the $2,000 deficit must be reflected as an additional amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">B. If the consumer provides $1,500 in cash (which does not extinguish the $2,000 deficit), the creditor may disclose a downpayment of $1,500 or of $0.</p><p class="depth0">C. If the consumer provides $3,000 in cash, the creditor may disclose a downpayment of $3,000 or of $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(19) Dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. A dwelling need not be the consumer's principal residence to fit the definition, and thus a vacation or second home could be a dwelling. However, for purposes of the definition of residential mortgage transaction and the right to rescind, a dwelling must be the principal residence of the consumer. (See the commentary to Sec. Sec. 226.2(a)(24), 226.15, and 226.23.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Use as a residence. Mobile homes, boats, and trailers are dwellings if they are in fact used as residences, just as are condominium and cooperative units. Recreational vehicles, campers, and the like not used as residences are not dwellings.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relation to exemptions. Any transaction involving a security interest in a consumer's principal dwelling (as well as in any real property) remains subject to the regulation despite the general exemption in Sec. 226.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(20) Open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This definition describes the characteristics of open-end credit (for which the applicable disclosure and other rules are contained in Subpart B), as distinct from closed-end credit. Open-end credit is consumer credit that is extended under a plan and meets all 3 criteria set forth in the definition.</p><p class="depth0">2. Existence of a plan. The definition requires that there be a plan, which connotes a contractual arrangement between the creditor and the consumer. Some creditors offer programs containing a number of different credit features. The consumer has a single account with the institution that can be accessed repeatedly via a number of sub-accounts established for the different program features and rate structures. Some features of the program might be used repeatedly (for example, an overdraft line) while others might be used infrequently (such as the part of the credit line available for secured credit). If the program as a whole is subject to prescribed terms and otherwise meets the definition of open-end credit, such a program would be considered a single, multifeatured plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Repeated transactions. Under this criterion, the creditor must reasonably contemplate repeated transactions. This means that the credit plan must be usable from time to time and the creditor must legitimately expect that there will be repeat business rather than a one-time credit extension. The creditor must expect repeated dealings with consumers under the credit plan as a whole and need not believe a consumer will reuse a particular feature of the plan. The determination of whether a creditor can reasonably contemplate repeated transactions requires an objective analysis. Information that much of the creditor's customer base with accounts under the plan make repeated transactions over some period of time is relevant to the determination, particularly when the plan is opened primarily for the financing of infrequently purchased products or services. A standard based on reasonable belief by a creditor necessarily includes some margin for judgmental error. The fact that particular consumers do not return for further credit extensions does not prevent a plan from having been properly characterized as open-end. For example, if much of the customer base of a clothing store makes repeat purchases, the fact that some consumers use the plan only once would not affect the characterization of the store's plan as open-end credit. The criterion regarding repeated transactions is a question of fact to be decided in the context of the creditor's type of business and the creditor's relationship with its customers. For example, it would be more reasonable for a bank or depository institution to contemplate repeated transactions with a customer than for a seller of aluminum siding to make the same assumption about its customers.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charge on an outstanding balance. The requirement that a finance charge may be computed and imposed from time to time on the outstanding balance means that there is no specific amount financed for the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated. A plan may meet the definition of open-end credit even though a finance charge is not normally imposed, provided the creditor has the right, under the plan, to impose a finance charge from time to time on the outstanding balance. For example, in some plans, a finance charge is not imposed if the consumer pays all or a specified portion of the outstanding balance within a given time period. Such a plan could meet the finance charge criterion, if the creditor has the right to impose a finance charge, even though the consumer actually pays no finance charges during the existence of the plan because the consumer takes advantage of the option to pay the balance (either in full or in installments) within the time necessary to avoid finance charges.</p><p class="depth0">5. Reusable line. The total amount of credit that may be extended during the existence of an open-end plan is unlimited because available credit is generally replenished as earlier advances are repaid. A line of credit is self-

replenishing even though the plan itself has a fixed expiration date, as long as during the plan's existence the consumer may use the line, repay, and reuse the credit. The creditor may occasionally or routinely verify credit information such as the consumer's continued income and employment status or information for security purposes but, to meet the definition of open-end credit, such verification of credit information may not be done as a condition of granting a consumer's request for a particular advance under the plan. In general, a credit line is self-replenishing if the consumer can take further advances as outstanding balances are repaid without being required to separately apply for those additional advances. A credit card account where the plan as a whole replenishes meets the self-replenishing criterion, notwithstanding the fact that a credit card issuer may verify credit information from time to time in connection with specific transactions. This criterion of unlimited credit distinguishes open-end credit from a series of advances made pursuant to a closed-end credit loan commitment. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Under a closed-end commitment, the creditor might agree to lend a total of $10,000 in a series of advances as needed by the consumer. When a consumer has borrowed the full $10,000, no more is advanced under that particular agreement, even if there has been repayment of a portion of the debt. (See Sec. 226.2(a)(17)(iv) for disclosure requirements when a credit card is used to obtain the advances.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. This criterion does not mean that the creditor must establish a specific credit limit for the line of credit or that the line of credit must always be replenished to its original amount. The creditor may reduce a credit limit or refuse to extend new credit in a particular case due to changes in the creditor's financial condition or the consumer's creditworthiness. (The rules in Sec. 226.5b(f), however, limit the ability of a creditor to suspend credit advances for home equity plans.) While consumers should have a reasonable expectation of obtaining credit as long as they remain current and within any preset credit limits, further extensions of credit need not be an absolute right in order for the plan to meet the self-replenishing criterion.</p><p class="depth0">6. Verifications of collateral value. Creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of Sec. 226.2(a)(20) extend open-end credit notwithstanding the fact that the creditor must verify collateral values to comply with federal, state, or other applicable law or verifies the value of collateral in connection with a particular advance under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">7. Open-end real estate mortgages. Some credit plans call for negotiated advances under so-called open-end real estate mortgages. Each such plan must be independently measured against the definition of open-end credit, regardless of the terminology used in the industry to describe the plan. The fact that a particular plan is called an open-end real estate mortgage, for example, does not, by itself, mean that it is open-end credit under the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(21) Periodic rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis. The periodic rate may be stated as a percentage (for example, 1\1/2\% per month) or as a decimal equivalent (for example, .015 monthly). It may be based on any portion of a year the creditor chooses. Some creditors use \1/360\ of an annual rate as their periodic rate. These creditors:</p><p class="depth0">i. May disclose a \1/360\ rate as a daily periodic rate, without further explanation, if it is in fact only applied 360 days per year. But if the creditor applies that rate for 365 days, the creditor must note that fact and, of course, disclose the true annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Would have to apply the rate to the balance to disclose the annual percentage rate with the degree of accuracy required in the regulation (that is, within \1/8\th of 1 percentage point of the rate based on the actual 365 days in the year).</p><p class="depth0">2. Transaction charges. Periodic rate does not include initial one-time transaction charges, even if the charge is computed as a percentage of the transaction amount.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(22) Person.</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint ventures. A joint venture is an organization and is therefore a person.</p><p class="depth0">2. Attorneys. An attorney and his or her client are considered to be the same person for purposes of this regulation when the attorney is acting within the scope of the attorney-client relationship with regard to a particular transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Trusts. A trust and its trustee are considered to be the same person for purposes of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(23) Prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Prepaid finance charges must be taken into account under Sec. 226.18(b) in computing the disclosed amount financed, and must be disclosed if the creditor provides an itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. Common examples of prepaid finance charges include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Buyer's points.</p><p class="depth0">B. Service fees.</p><p class="depth0">C. Loan fees.</p><p class="depth0">D. Finder's fees.</p><p class="depth0">E. Loan-guarantee insurance.</p><p class="depth0">F. Credit-investigation fees.</p><p class="depth0">ii. However, in order for these or any other finance charges to be considered prepaid, they must be either paid separately in cash or check or withheld from the proceeds. Prepaid finance charges include any portion of the finance charge paid prior to or at closing or settlement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exclusions. Add-on and discount finance charges are not prepaid finance charges for

purposes of this regulation. Finance charges are not prepaid merely because they are precomputed, whether or not a portion of the charge will be rebated to the consumer upon prepayment. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.18(b).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Allocation of lump-sum payments. In a credit sale transaction involving a lump-sum payment by the consumer and a discount or other item that is a finance charge under Sec. 226.4, the discount or other item is a prepaid finance charge to the extent the lump-sum payment is not applied to the cash price. For example, a seller sells property to a consumer for $10,000, requires the consumer to pay $3,000 at the time of the purchase, and finances the remainder as a closed-end credit transaction. The cash price of the property is $9,000. The seller is the creditor in the transaction and therefore the $1,000 difference between the credit and cash prices (the discount) is a finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(b)(9) and (c)(5).) If the creditor applies the entire $3,000 to the cash price and adds the $1,000 finance charge to the interest on the $6,000 to arrive at the total finance charge, all of the $3,000 lump-sum payment is a downpayment and the discount is not a prepaid finance charge. However, if the creditor only applies $2,000 of the lump-sum payment to the cash price, then $2,000 of the $3,000 is a downpayment and the $1,000 discount is a prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(24) Residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to other sections. This term is important in five provisions in the regulation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 226.4(c)(7)--exclusions from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 226.15(f)--exemption from the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Section 226.18(q)--whether or not the obligation is assumable.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Section 226.20(b)--disclosure requirements for assumptions.</p><p class="depth0">v. Section 226.23(f)--exemption from the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lien status. The definition is not limited to first lien transactions. For example, a consumer might assume a paid-down first mortgage (or borrow part of the purchase price) and borrow the balance of the purchase price from a creditor who takes a second mortgage. The second mortgage transaction is a residential mortgage transaction if the dwelling purchased is the consumer's principal residence.</p><p class="depth0">3. Principal dwelling. A consumer can have only one principal dwelling at a time. Thus, a vacation or other second home would not be a principal dwelling. However, if a consumer buys or builds a new dwelling that will become the consumer's principal dwelling within a year or upon the completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal dwelling for purposes of applying this definition to a particular transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. Sec. 226.15(a) and 226.23(a).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Construction financing. If a transaction meets the definition of a residential mortgage transaction and the creditor chooses to disclose it as several transactions under Sec. 226.17(c)(6), each one is considered to be a residential mortgage transaction, even if different creditors are involved. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditor makes a construction loan to finance the initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling, and the loan will be disbursed in five advances. The creditor gives six sets of disclosures (five for the construction phase and one for the permanent phase). Each one is a residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. One creditor finances the initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling and another creditor makes a loan to satisfy the construction loan and provide permanent financing. Both transactions are residential mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">5. Acquisition. i. A residential mortgage transaction finances the acquisition of a consumer's principal dwelling. The term does not include a transaction involving a consumer's principal dwelling if the consumer had previously purchased and acquired some interest to the dwelling, even though the consumer had not acquired full legal title.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of new transactions involving a previously acquired dwelling include the financing of a balloon payment due under a land sale contract and an extension of credit made to a joint owner of property to buy out the other joint owner's interest. In these instances, disclosures are not required under Sec. 226.18(q) (assumability policies). However, the rescission rules of Sec. Sec. 226.15 and 226.23 do apply to these new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In other cases, the disclosure and rescission rules do not apply. For example, where a buyer enters into a written agreement with the creditor holding the seller's mortgage, allowing the buyer to assume the mortgage, if the buyer had previously purchased the property and agreed with the seller to make the mortgage payments, Sec. 226.20(b) does not apply (assumptions involving residential mortgages).</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple purpose transactions. A transaction meets the definition of this section if any part of the loan proceeds will be used to finance the acquisition or initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling. For example, a transaction to finance the initial construction of the consumer's principal dwelling is a residential mortgage transaction even if a portion of the funds will be disbursed directly to the consumer or used to satisfy a loan for the purchase of the land on which the dwelling will be built.</p><p class="depth0">7. Construction on previously acquired vacant land. A residential mortgage transaction includes a loan to finance the construction of

a consumer's principal dwelling on a vacant lot previously acquired by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(25) Security interest.</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold test. The threshold test is whether a particular interest in property is recognized as a security interest under applicable law. The regulation does not determine whether a particular interest is a security interest under applicable law. If the creditor is unsure whether a particular interest is a security interest under applicable law (for example, if statutes and case law are either silent or inconclusive on the issue), the creditor may at its option consider such interests as security interests for Truth in Lending purposes. However, the regulation and the commentary do exclude specific interests, such as after-acquired property and accessories, from the scope of the definition regardless of their categorization under applicable law, and these named exclusions may not be disclosed as security interests under the regulation. (But see the discussion of exclusions elsewhere in the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(25).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The general definition of security interest excludes three groups of interests: incidental interests, interests in after-acquired property, and interests that arise solely by operation of law. These interests may not be disclosed with the disclosures required under Sec. 226.18, but the creditor is not precluded from preserving these rights elsewhere in the contract documents, or invoking and enforcing such rights, if it is otherwise lawful to do so. If the creditor is unsure whether a particular interest is one of the excluded interests, the creditor may, at its option, consider such interests as security interests for Truth in Lending purposes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Incidental interests. i. Incidental interests in property that are not security interests include, among other things:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assignment of rents.</p><p class="depth0">B. Right to condemnation proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">C. Interests in accessories and replacements.</p><p class="depth0">D. Interests in escrow accounts, such as for taxes and insurance.</p><p class="depth0">E. Waiver of homestead or personal property rights.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The notion of an incidental interest does not encompass an explicit security interest in an insurance policy if that policy is the primary collateral for the transaction--for example, in an insurance premium financing transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Operation of law. Interests that arise solely by operation of law are excluded from the general definition. Also excluded are interests arising by operation of law that are merely repeated or referred to in the contract. However, if the creditor has an interest that arises by operation of law, such as a vendor's lien, and takes an independent security interest in the same property, such as a UCC security interest, the latter interest is a disclosable security interest unless otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rescission rules. Security interests that arise solely by operation of law are security interests for purposes of rescission. Examples of such interests are mechanics' and materialmen's liens.</p><p class="depth0">6. Specificity of disclosure. A creditor need not separately disclose multiple security interests that it may hold in the same collateral. The creditor need only disclose that the transaction is secured by the collateral, even when security interests from prior transactions remain of record and a new security interest is taken in connection with the transaction. In disclosing the fact that the transaction is secured by the collateral, the creditor also need not disclose how the security interest arose. For example, in a closed-end credit transaction, a rescission notice need not specifically state that a new security interest is ``acquired'' or an existing security interest is ``retained'' in the transaction. The acquisition or retention of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling instead may be disclosed in a rescission notice with a general statement such as the following: ``Your home is the security for the new transaction.''</p><p class="depth0">2(b) Rules of construction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Footnotes. Footnotes are used extensively in the regulation to provide special exceptions and more detailed explanations and examples. Material that appears in a footnote has the same legal weight as material in the body of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount. The numerical amount must be a dollar amount unless otherwise indicated. For example, in a closed-end transaction (Subpart C), the amount financed and the amount of any payment must be expressed as a dollar amount. In some cases, an amount should be expressed as a percentage. For example, in disclosures provided before the first transaction under an open-end plan (Subpart B), creditors are permitted to explain how the amount of any finance charge will be determined; where a cash-advance fee (which is a finance charge) is a percentage of each cash advance, the amount of the finance charge for that fee is expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.3--Exempt Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.12. The provisions in Sec. 226.12(a) and (b) governing the issuance of credit cards and the limitations on liability for their unauthorized use apply to all credit cards, even if the credit cards are issued for use in connection with extensions of credit that otherwise are exempt under this section.</p><p class="depth0">3(a) Business, commercial, agricultural, or organizational credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Primary purposes. A creditor must determine in each case if the transaction is primarily for an exempt purpose. If some question exists as to the primary purpose for a credit extension, the creditor is, of course, free to make the disclosures, and the fact that disclosures are made under such circumstances is not controlling on the question of whether the transaction was exempt. (See comment 3(a)-2, however, with respect to credit cards.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Business purpose purchases.</p><p class="depth0">i. Business-purpose credit cards--extensions of credit for consumer purposes. If a business-purpose credit card is issued to a person, the provisions of the regulation do not apply, other than as provided in Sec. Sec. 226.12(a) and 226.12(b), even if extensions of credit for consumer purposes are occasionally made using that business-purpose credit card. For example, the billing error provisions set forth in Sec. 226.13 do not apply to consumer-purpose extensions of credit using a business-purpose credit card.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Consumer-purpose credit cards--extensions of credit for business purposes. If a consumer-purpose credit card is issued to a person, the provisions of the regulation apply, even to occasional extensions of credit for business purposes made using that consumer-purpose credit card. For example, a consumer may assert a billing error with respect to any extension of credit using a consumer-purpose credit card, even if the specific extension of credit on such credit card or open-end credit plan that is the subject of the dispute was made for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Factors. In determining whether credit to finance an acquisition--such as securities, antiques, or art--is primarily for business or commercial purposes (as opposed to a consumer purpose), the following factors should be considered:</p><p class="depth0">i. General.</p><p class="depth0">A. The relationship of the borrower's primary occupation to the acquisition. The more closely related, the more likely it is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">B. The degree to which the borrower will personally manage the acquisition. The more personal involvement there is, the more likely it is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">C. The ratio of income from the acquisition to the total income of the borrower. The higher the ratio, the more likely it is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">D. The size of the transaction. The larger the transaction, the more likely it is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">E. The borrower's statement of purpose for the loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Business-purpose examples. Examples of business-purpose credit include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A loan to expand a business, even if it is secured by the borrower's residence or personal property.</p><p class="depth0">B. A loan to improve a principal residence by putting in a business office.</p><p class="depth0">C. A business account used occasionally for consumer purposes.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Consumer-purpose examples. Examples of consumer-purpose credit include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Credit extensions by a company to its employees or agents if the loans are used for personal purposes.</p><p class="depth0">B. A loan secured by a mechanic's tools to pay a child's tuition.</p><p class="depth0">C. A personal account used occasionally for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Non-owner-occupied rental property. Credit extended to acquire, improve, or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of housing units) that is not owner-occupied is deemed to be for business purposes. This includes, for example, the acquisition of a warehouse that will be leased or a single-family house that will be rented to another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be considered non-owner-occupied and this special rule will not apply. For example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is not governed by this special rule. (See comment 3(a)-5, however, for rules relating to owner-occupied rental property.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Owner-occupied rental property. If credit is extended to acquire, improve, or maintain rental property that is or will be owner-occupied within the coming year, different rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. Credit extended to acquire the rental property is deemed to be for business purposes if it contains more than 2 housing units.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Credit extended to improve or maintain the rental property is deemed to be for business purposes if it contains more than 4 housing units. Since the amended statute defines dwelling to include 1 to 4 housing units, this rule preserves the right of rescission for credit extended for purposes other than acquisition. Neither of these rules means that an extension of credit for property containing fewer than the requisite number of units is necessarily consumer credit. In such cases, the determination of whether it is business or consumer credit should be made by considering the factors listed in comment 3(a)-3.</p><p class="depth0">6. Business credit later refinanced. Business-purpose credit that is exempt from the regulation may later be rewritten for consumer purposes. Such a transaction is consumer credit requiring disclosures only if the existing obligation is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation made for consumer purposes undertaken by the same obligor.</p><p class="depth0">7. Credit card renewal. A consumer-purpose credit card that is subject to the regulation may be converted into a business-purpose

credit card at the time of its renewal, and the resulting business-purpose credit card would be exempt from the regulation. Conversely, a business-purpose credit card that is exempt from the regulation may be converted into a consumer-purpose credit card at the time of its renewal, and the resulting consumer-purpose credit card would be subject to the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">8. Agricultural purpose. An agricultural purpose includes the planting, propagating, nurturing, harvesting, catching, storing, exhibiting, marketing, transporting, processing, or manufacturing of food, beverages (including alcoholic beverages), flowers, trees, livestock, poultry, bees, wildlife, fish, or shellfish by a natural person engaged in farming, fishing, or growing crops, flowers, trees, livestock, poultry, bees, or wildlife. The exemption also applies to a transaction involving real property that includes a dwelling (for example, the purchase of a farm with a homestead) if the transaction is primarily for agricultural purposes.</p><p class="depth0">9. Organizational credit. The exemption for transactions in which the borrower is not a natural person applies, for example, to loans to corporations, partnerships, associations, churches, unions, and fraternal organizations. The exemption applies regardless of the purpose of the credit extension and regardless of the fact that a natural person may guarantee or provide security for the credit.</p><p class="depth0">10. Land trusts. Credit extended for consumer purposes to a land trust is considered to be credit extended to a natural person rather than credit extended to an organization. In some jurisdictions, a financial institution financing a residential real estate transaction for an individual uses a land trust mechanism. Title to the property is conveyed to the land trust for which the financial institution itself is trustee. The underlying installment note is executed by the financial institution in its capacity as trustee and payment is secured by a trust deed, reflecting title in the financial institution as trustee. In some instances, the consumer executes a personal guaranty of the indebtedness. The note provides that it is payable only out of the property specifically described in the trust deed and that the trustee has no personal liability on the note. Assuming the transactions are for personal, family, or household purposes, these transactions are subject to the regulation since in substance (if not form) consumer credit is being extended.</p><p class="depth0">3(b) Credit over applicable threshold amount.</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec. 226.3(b), the threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated below for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. This comment will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.</p><p class="depth0">i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. From July 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the threshold amount is $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">iii. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the threshold amount is $51,800.</p><p class="depth0">iv. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the threshold amount is $53,000.</p><p class="depth0">v. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the threshold amount is $53,500.</p><p class="depth0">vi. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold amount is $54,600.</p><p class="depth0">vii. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the threshold amount is $54,600.</p><p class="depth0">2. Open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">i. Qualifying for exemption. An open-end account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) (unless secured by any real property, or by personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling) if either of the following conditions is met</p><p class="depth0">A. The creditor makes an initial extension of credit at or after account opening that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time the initial extension is made. If a creditor makes an initial extension of credit after account opening that does not exceed the threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made, the creditor must have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this Part from the date the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable), including but not limited to the requirements of Sec. 226.6 (account-opening disclosures), Sec. 226.7 (periodic statements), Sec. 226.52 (limitations on fees), and Sec. 226.55 (limitations on increasing annual percentages rates, fees, and charges). For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is $50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $60,000. In this circumstance, no requirements of this Part apply to the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is $50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does not make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the creditor makes an

initial extension of credit of $50,000 or less. In this circumstance, the account is not exempt and the creditor must have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this Part from the date the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">B. The creditor makes a firm written commitment at account opening to extend a total amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in effect at the time the account is opened with no requirement of additional credit information for any advances on the account (except as permitted from time to time with respect to open-end accounts pursuant to Sec. 226.2(a)(20)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes generally. Subsequent changes to an open-end account or the threshold amount may result in the account no longer qualifying for the exemption in Sec. 226.3(b). In these circumstances, the creditor must begin to comply with all of the applicable requirements of this Part within a reasonable period of time after the account ceases to be exempt. Once an account ceases to be exempt, the requirements of this Part apply to any balances on the account. The creditor, however, is not required to comply with the requirements of this Part with respect to the period of time during which the account was exempt. For example, if an open-end credit account ceases to be exempt, the creditor must within a reasonable period of time provide the disclosures required by Sec. 226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account and begin to provide periodic statements consistent with Sec. 226.7. However, the creditor is not required to disclose fees or charges imposed while the account was exempt. Furthermore, if the creditor provided disclosures consistent with the requirements of this Part while the account was exempt, it is not required to provide disclosures required by Sec. 226.6 reflecting the current terms of the account. See also comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on initial extension of credit. If a creditor makes an initial extension of credit that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at that time, the open-end account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount, including an increase pursuant to Sec. 226.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the CPI-W. Furthermore, in these circumstances, the account remains exempt even if there are no further extensions of credit, subsequent extensions of credit do not exceed the threshold amount, the account balance is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount (such as through repayment of the extension), or the credit limit for the account is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount. However, if the initial extension of credit on an account does not exceed the threshold amount in effect at the time of the extension, the account is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) even if a subsequent extension exceeds the threshold amount or if the account balance later exceeds the threshold amount (for example, due to the subsequent accrual of interest).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on firm commitment.</p><p class="depth0">A. General. If a creditor makes a firm written commitment at account opening to extend a total amount of credit that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at that time, the open-end account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount pursuant to Sec. 226.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the CPI-W. However, see comment 3(b)-6 with respect to the increase in the threshold amount from $25,000 to $50,000. If an open-end account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend credit, the account remains exempt even if the amount of credit actually extended does not exceed the threshold amount. In contrast, if the firm commitment does not exceed the threshold amount at account opening, the account is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) even if the account balance later exceeds the threshold amount. In addition, if a creditor reduces a firm commitment, the account ceases to be exempt unless the reduced firm commitment exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of the reduction. For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. If during year one the creditor reduces its firm commitment to $53,000, the account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b). However, if during year one the creditor reduces its firm commitment to $40,000, the account is no longer exempt under Sec. 226.3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. If the threshold amount is $56,000 on January 1 of year six as a result of increases in the CPI-W, the account remains exempt. However, if the creditor reduces its firm commitment to $54,000 on July 1 of year six, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec. 226.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">B. Initial extension of credit. If an open-end account qualifies for a Sec. 226.3(b) exemption at account opening based on a firm commitment, that account may also subsequently qualify for a Sec. 226.3(b) exemption based on an initial extension of credit. However, that initial extension must be a single advance in excess of the threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made. In addition, the account must continue to qualify for an exemption based on the firm commitment until the initial extension of credit is made. For example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. The account is not used for an extension of credit during year one. On January 1 of year two, the threshold amount is increased to $51,000 pursuant to Sec. 226.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the CPI-W. On July 1 of year two, the consumer uses the account for an initial extension of $52,000. As a result of this extension of credit, the account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) even if, after July 1 of year two, the creditor reduces the firm commitment to $51,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Same facts as in paragraph iv.B(1) above except that the consumer uses the account for an initial extension of $30,000 on July 1 of year two and for an extension of $22,000 on July 15 of year two. In these circumstances, the account is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on the $30,000 initial extension of credit because that extension did not exceed the applicable threshold amount ($51,000), although the account remains exempt based on the firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Same facts as in paragraph iv.B(1) above except that, on April 1 of year two, the creditor reduces the firm commitment to $50,000, which is below the $51,000 threshold then in effect. Because the account ceases to qualify for a Sec. 226.3(b) exemption on April 1 of year two, the account does not qualify for a Sec. 226.3(b) exemption based on a $52,000 initial extension of credit on July 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">3. Closed-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">i. Qualifying for exemption. A closed-end loan is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) (unless the extension of credit is secured by any real property, or by personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling; or is a private education loan as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(5)), if either of the following conditions is met</p><p class="depth0">A. The creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. In these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) even if the amount owed is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount (such as through repayment of the loan).</p><p class="depth0">B. The creditor makes a commitment at consummation to extend a total amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. In these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) even if the total amount of credit extended does not exceed the threshold amount.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes. If a creditor makes a closed-end extension of credit or commitment to extend closed-end credit that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the closed-end loan remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount. However, a closed-end loan is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) merely because it is used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan, unless the new extension of credit is itself exempt under the applicable threshold amount. For example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec. 226.3(b) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is less than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this Part with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, which is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b). See also comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Addition of a security interest in real property or a dwelling after account opening or consummation.</p><p class="depth0">i. Open-end credit. For open-end accounts, if, after account opening, a security interest is taken in any real property, or in personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling, a previously exempt account ceases to be exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) and the creditor must begin to comply with all of the applicable requirements of this Part within a reasonable period of time. See comment 3(b)-2.ii. If a security interest is taken in the consumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must also give the consumer the right to rescind the security interest consistent with Sec. 226.15.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Closed-end credit. For closed-end loans, if, after consummation, a security interest is taken in any real property, or in personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling, an exempt loan remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b). However, the addition of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling is a transaction for purposes of Sec. 226.23 and the creditor must give the consumer the right to rescind the security interest consistent with that section. See Sec. 226.23(a)(1) and the accompanying commentary. In contrast, if a closed-end loan that is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) is satisfied and replaced by a loan that is secured by any real property, or by personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling, the new loan is not exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) and the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of this Part. See comment 3(b)-3.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application to extensions secured by mobile homes. Because a mobile home can be a dwelling under Sec. 226.2(a)(19), the exemption in Sec. 226.3(b) does not apply to a credit extension secured by a mobile home that is used or expected to be used as the principal dwelling of the consumer. See comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">6. Transition rule for open-end accounts exempt prior to July 21, 2011. Section 226.3(b)(2)

applies only to open-end accounts opened prior to July 21, 2011. Section 226.3(b)(2) does not apply if a security interest is taken by the creditor in any real property, or in personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling. If, on July 20, 2011, an open-end account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend credit in excess of $25,000, the account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b)(2) until December 31, 2011 (unless the firm commitment is reduced to $25,000 or less). If the firm commitment is increased on or before December 31, 2011 to an amount in excess of $50,000, the account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b)(1) regardless of subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a result of increases in the CPI-W. If the firm commitment is not increased on or before December 31, 2011 to an amount in excess of $50,000, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend credit. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, on July 20, 2011, the account is exempt under Sec. 226.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $30,000 in credit. On November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the firm commitment on the account to $55,000. In these circumstances, the account remains exempt under Sec. 226.3(b)(1) regardless of subsequent increases in the threshold amount as a result of increases in the CPI-W.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as paragraph i. above except, on November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the firm commitment on the account to $40,000. In these circumstances, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec. 226.3(b)(2) after December 31, 2011, and the creditor must begin to comply with the applicable requirements of this Part.</p><p class="depth0">3(c) Public utility credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Examples of public utility services include:</p><p class="depth0">i. General.</p><p class="depth0">A. Gas, water, or electrical services.</p><p class="depth0">B. Cable television services.</p><p class="depth0">C. Installation of new sewer lines, water lines, conduits, telephone poles, or metering equipment in an area not already serviced by the utility.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Extensions of credit not covered. The exemption does not apply to extensions of credit, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A.

To finance home improvements such as new heating or air conditioning systems.</p><p class="depth0">3(d) Securities or commodities accounts.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This exemption does not apply to a transaction with a broker registered solely with the state, or to a separate credit extension in which the proceeds are used to purchase securities.</p><p class="depth0">3(e) Home fuel budget plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Under a typical home fuel budget plan, the fuel dealer estimates the total cost of fuel for the season, bills the customer for an average monthly payment, and makes an adjustment in the final payment for any difference between the estimated and the actual cost of the fuel. Fuel is delivered as needed, no finance charge is assessed, and the customer may withdraw from the plan at any time. Under these circumstances, the arrangement is exempt from the regulation, even if a charge to cover the billing costs is imposed.</p><p class="depth0">3(f) Student loan programs.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This exemption applies to loans made, insured, or guaranteed under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.). This exemption does not apply to private education loans as defined by Sec. 226.46(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.4--Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">4(a) Definition.</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges in comparable cash transactions. Charges imposed uniformly in cash and credit transactions are not finance charges. In determining whether an item is a finance charge, the creditor should compare the credit transaction in question with a similar cash transaction. A creditor financing the sale of property or services may compare charges with those payable in a similar cash transaction by the seller of the property or service.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, the following items are not finance charges:</p><p class="depth0">A. Taxes, license fees, or registration fees paid by both cash and credit customers.</p><p class="depth0">B. Discounts that are available to cash and credit customers, such as quantity discounts.</p><p class="depth0">C. Discounts available to a particular group of consumers because they meet certain criteria, such as being members of an organization or having accounts at a particular financial institution. This is the case even if an individual must pay cash to obtain the discount, provided that credit customers who are members of the group and do not qualify for the discount pay no more than the nonmember cash customers.</p><p class="depth0">D. Charges for a service policy, auto club membership, or policy of insurance against latent defects offered to or required of both cash and credit customers for the same price.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, the following items are finance charges:</p><p class="depth0">A. Inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of construction-loan proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">B. Fees for preparing a Truth in Lending disclosure statement, if permitted by law (for example, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits such charges in certain transactions secured by real property).</p><p class="depth0">C. Charges for a required maintenance or service contract imposed only in a credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the charge in a credit transaction exceeds the charge imposed in a comparable cash transaction, only the difference is a finance charge. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If an escrow agent is used in both cash and credit sales of real estate and the agent's charge is $100 in a cash transaction and $150 in a credit transaction, only $50 is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">2. Costs of doing business. Charges absorbed by the creditor as a cost of doing business are not finance charges, even though the creditor may take such costs into consideration in determining the interest rate to be charged or the cash price of the property or service sold. However, if the creditor separately imposes a charge on the consumer to cover certain costs, the charge is a finance charge if it otherwise meets the definition. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A discount imposed on a credit obligation when it is assigned by a seller-creditor to another party is not a finance charge as long as the discount is not separately imposed on the consumer. (See Sec. 226.4(b)(6).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. A tax imposed by a state or other governmental body on a creditor is not a finance charge if the creditor absorbs the tax as a cost of doing business and does not separately impose the tax on the consumer. (For additional discussion of the treatment of taxes, see other commentary to Sec. 226.4(a).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Forfeitures of interest. If the creditor reduces the interest rate it pays or stops paying interest on the consumer's deposit account or any portion of it for the term of a credit transaction (including, for example, an overdraft on a checking account or a loan secured by a certificate of deposit), the interest lost is a finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(c)(6).) For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A consumer borrows $5,000 for 90 days and secures it with a $10,000 certificate of deposit paying 15% interest. The creditor charges the consumer an interest rate of 6% on the loan and stops paying interest on $5,000 of the $10,000 certificate for the term of the loan. The interest lost is a finance charge and must be reflected in the annual percentage rate on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">B. However, the consumer must be entitled to the interest that is not paid in order for the lost interest to be a finance charge. For example:</p><p class="depth0">iii. A consumer wishes to buy from a financial institution a $10,000 certificate of deposit paying 15% interest but has only $4,000. The financial institution offers to lend the consumer $6,000 at an interest rate of 6% but will pay the 15% interest only on the amount of the consumer's deposit, $4,000. The creditor's failure to pay interest on the $6,000 does not result in an additional finance charge on the extension of credit, provided the consumer is entitled by the deposit agreement with the financial institution to interest only on the amount of the consumer's deposit.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A consumer enters into a combined time deposit/credit agreement with a financial institution that establishes a time deposit account and an open-end line of credit. The line of credit may be used to borrow against the funds in the time deposit. The agreement provides for an interest rate on any credit extension of, for example, 1%. In addition, the agreement states that the creditor will pay 0% interest on the amount of the time deposit that corresponds to the amount of the credit extension(s). The interest that is not paid on the time deposit by the financial institution is not a finance charge (and therefore does not affect the annual percentage rate computation).</p><p class="depth0">4. Treatment of transaction fees on credit card plans. Any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account such as a checking or savings account. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for the use of an automated teller machine (ATM) to obtain a cash advance (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash from a consumer asset account, such as a checking or savings account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase or obtaining a cash advance outside the United States, with a foreign merchant, or in a foreign currency is a finance charge, regardless of whether a charge is imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions. The following principles apply in determining what is a foreign transaction fee and the amount of the fee:</p><p class="depth0">A. Included are (1) fees imposed when transactions are made in a foreign currency and converted to U.S. dollars; (2) fees imposed when transactions are made in U.S. dollars outside the U.S.; and (3) fees imposed when transactions are made (whether in a foreign currency or in U.S. dollars) with a foreign merchant, such as via a merchant's Web site. For example, a consumer may use a credit card to make a purchase in Bermuda, in U.S. dollars, and the card issuer may impose a fee because the transaction took place outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">B. Included are fees imposed by the card issuer and fees imposed by a third party that performs the conversion, such as a credit card network or the card issuer's corporate parent. (For example, in a transaction processed through a credit card network, the network may impose a 1 percent charge and the card-issuing bank may impose an additional 2 percent charge, for a total of a 3 percentage

point foreign transaction fee being imposed on the consumer.)</p><p class="depth0">C. Fees imposed by a third party are included only if they are directly passed on to the consumer. For example, if a credit card network imposes a 1 percent fee on the card issuer, but the card issuer absorbs the fee as a cost of doing business (and only passes it on to consumers in the general sense that the interest and fees are imposed on all its customers to recover its costs), then the fee is not a foreign transaction fee and need not be disclosed. In another example, if the credit card network imposes a 1 percent fee for a foreign transaction on the card issuer, and the card issuer imposes this same fee on the consumer who engaged in the foreign transaction, then the fee is a foreign transaction fee and a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">D. A card issuer is not required to disclose a fee imposed by a merchant. For example, if the merchant itself performs the currency conversion and adds a fee, this fee need not be disclosed by the card issuer. Under Sec. 226.9(d), a card issuer is not obligated to disclose finance charges imposed by a party honoring a credit card, such as a merchant, although the merchant is required to disclose such a finance charge if the merchant is subject to the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">E. The foreign transaction fee is determined by first calculating the dollar amount of the transaction by using a currency conversion rate outside the card issuer's and third party's control. Any amount in excess of that dollar amount is a foreign transaction fee. Conversion rates outside the card issuer's and third party's control include, for example, a rate selected from the range of rates available in the wholesale currency exchange markets, an average of the highest and lowest rates available in such markets, or a government-mandated or government-managed exchange rate (or a rate selected from a range of such rates).</p><p class="depth0">F. The rate used for a particular transaction need not be the same rate that the card issuer (or third party) itself obtains in its currency conversion operations. In addition, the rate used for a particular transaction need not be the rate in effect on the date of the transaction (purchase or cash advance).</p><p class="depth0">5. Taxes.</p><p class="depth0">i. Generally, a tax imposed by a state or other governmental body solely on a creditor is a finance charge if the creditor separately imposes the charge on the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, a tax is not a finance charge (even if it is collected by the creditor) if applicable law imposes the tax:</p><p class="depth0">A. Solely on the consumer;</p><p class="depth0">B. On the creditor and the consumer jointly;</p><p class="depth0">C. On the credit transaction, without indicating which party is liable for the tax; or</p><p class="depth0">D. On the creditor, if applicable law directs or authorizes the creditor to pass the tax on to the consumer. (For purposes of this section, if applicable law is silent as to passing on the tax, the law is deemed not to authorize passing it on.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. For example, a stamp tax, property tax, intangible tax, or any other state or local tax imposed on the consumer, or on the credit transaction, is not a finance charge even if the tax is collected by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In addition, a tax is not a finance charge if it is excluded from the finance charge by another provision of the regulation or commentary (for example, if the tax is imposed uniformly in cash and credit transactions).</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(1) Charges by third parties.</p><p class="depth0">1. Choosing the provider of a required service. An example of a third-party charge included in the finance charge is the cost of required mortgage insurance, even if the consumer is allowed to choose the insurer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Annuities associated with reverse mortgages. Some creditors offer annuities in connection with a reverse-mortgage transaction. The amount of the premium is a finance charge if the creditor requires the purchase of the annuity incident to the credit. Examples include the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. The credit documents reflect the purchase of an annuity from a specific provider or providers.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor assesses an additional charge on consumers who do not purchase an annuity from a specific provider.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The annuity is intended to replace in whole or in part the creditor's payments to the consumer either immediately or at some future date.</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(2) Special rule; closing agent charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This rule applies to charges by a third party serving as the closing agent for the particular loan. An example of a closing agent charge included in the finance charge is a courier fee where the creditor requires the use of a courier.</p><p class="depth0">2. Required closing agent. If the creditor requires the use of a closing agent, fees charged by the closing agent are included in the finance charge only if the creditor requires the particular service, requires the imposition of the charge, or retains a portion of the charge. Fees charged by a third-party closing agent may be otherwise excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4. For example, a fee that would be paid in a comparable cash transaction may be excluded under Sec. 226.4(a). A charge for conducting or attending a closing is a finance charge and may be excluded only if the charge is included in and is incidental to a lump-sum fee excluded under Sec. 226.4(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(3) Special rule; mortgage broker fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A fee charged by a mortgage broker is excluded from the finance charge if it is the type of fee that is also excluded

when charged by the creditor. For example, to exclude an application fee from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1), a mortgage broker must charge the fee to all applicants for credit, whether or not credit is extended.</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage. This rule applies to charges paid by consumers to a mortgage broker in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">3. Compensation by lender. The rule requires all mortgage broker fees to be included in the finance charge. Creditors sometimes compensate mortgage brokers under a separate arrangement with those parties. Creditors may draw on amounts paid by the consumer, such as points or closing costs, to fund their payment to the broker. Compensation paid by a creditor to a mortgage broker under an agreement is not included as a separate component of a consumer's total finance charge (although this compensation may be reflected in the finance charge if it comes from amounts paid by the consumer to the creditor that are finance charges, such as points and interest).</p><p class="depth0">4(b) Examples of finance charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to other provisions. Charges or fees shown as examples of finance charges in Sec. 226.4(b) may be excludable under Sec. 226.4(c), (d), or (e). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Premiums for credit life insurance, shown as an example of a finance charge under Sec. 226.4(b)(7), may be excluded if the requirements of Sec. 226.4(d)(1) are met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Appraisal fees mentioned in Sec. 226.4(b)(4) are excluded for real property or residential mortgage transactions under Sec. 226.4(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Checking account charges. A checking or transaction account charge imposed in connection with a credit feature is a finance charge under Sec. 226.4(b)(2) to the extent the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature. If a charge for an account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge under Sec. 226.4(b)(2). To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. A $5 service charge is imposed on an account with an overdraft line of credit (where the institution has agreed in writing to pay an overdraft), while a $3 service charge is imposed on an account without a credit feature; the $2 difference is a finance charge. (If the difference is not related to account activity, however, it may be excludable as a participation fee. See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(c)(4).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. A $5 service charge is imposed for each item that results in an overdraft on an account with an overdraft line of credit, while a $25 service charge is imposed for paying or returning each item on a similar account without a credit feature; the $5 charge is not a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption fees. The assumption fees mentioned in Sec. 226.4(b)(3) are finance charges only when the assumption occurs and the fee is imposed on the new buyer. The assumption fee is a finance charge in the new buyer's transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit loss insurance. Common examples of the insurance against credit loss mentioned in Sec. 226.4(b)(5) are mortgage guaranty insurance, holder in due course insurance, and repossession insurance. Such premiums must be included in the finance charge only for the period that the creditor requires the insurance to be maintained.</p><p class="depth0">2. Residual value insurance. Where a creditor requires a consumer to maintain residual value insurance or where the creditor is a beneficiary of a residual value insurance policy written in connection with an extension of credit (as is the case in some forms of automobile balloon-payment financing, for example), the premiums for the insurance must be included in the finance charge for the period that the insurance is to be maintained. If a creditor pays for residual-value insurance and absorbs the payment as a cost of doing business, such costs are not considered finance charges. (See comment 4(a)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs 4(b)(7) and (b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">1. Pre-existing insurance policy. The insurance discussed in Sec. 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) does not include an insurance policy (such as a life or an automobile collision insurance policy) that is already owned by the consumer, even if the policy is assigned to or otherwise made payable to the creditor to satisfy an insurance requirement. Such a policy is not ``written in connection with'' the transaction, as long as the insurance was not purchased for use in that credit extension, since it was previously owned by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Insurance written in connection with a transaction. Credit insurance sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is opened is considered ``written in connection with a credit transaction.'' Insurance sold after consummation in closed-end credit transactions or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b is not considered ``written in connection with'' the credit transaction if the insurance is written because of the consumer's default (for example, by failing to obtain or maintain required property insurance) or because the consumer requests insurance after consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b (although credit-sale disclosures may be required for the insurance sold after consummation if it is financed).</p><p class="depth0">3. Substitution of life insurance. The premium for a life insurance policy purchased and assigned to satisfy a credit life insurance requirement must be included in the finance charge, but only to the extent of the cost of the credit life insurance if purchased from

the creditor or the actual cost of the policy (if that is less than the cost of the insurance available from the creditor). If the creditor does not offer the required insurance, the premium to be included in the finance charge is the cost of a policy of insurance of the type, amount, and term required by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">4. Other insurance. Fees for required insurance not of the types described in Sec. 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) are finance charges and are not excludable. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The premium for a hospitalization insurance policy, if it is required to be purchased only in a credit transaction, is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(9).</p><p class="depth0">1. Discounts for payment by other than credit. The discounts to induce payment by other than credit mentioned in Sec. 226.4(b)(9) include, for example, the following situation:</p><p class="depth0">i. The seller of land offers individual tracts for $10,000 each. If the purchaser pays cash, the price is $9,000, but if the purchaser finances the tract with the seller the price is $10,000. The $1,000 difference is a finance charge for those who buy the tracts on credit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exception for cash discounts.</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors may exclude from the finance charge discounts offered to consumers for using cash or another means of payment instead of using a credit card or an open-end plan. The discount may be in whatever amount the seller desires, either as a percentage of the regular price (as defined in section 103(z) of the act, as amended) or a dollar amount. Pursuant to section 167(b) of the act, this provision applies only to transactions involving an open-end credit plan or a credit card (whether open-end or closed-end credit is extended on the card). The merchant must offer the discount to prospective buyers whether or not they are cardholders or members of the open-end credit plan. The merchant may, however, make other distinctions. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The merchant may limit the discount to payment by cash and not offer it for payment by check or by use of a debit card.</p><p class="depth0">B. The merchant may establish a discount plan that allows a 15% discount for payment by cash, a 10% discount for payment by check, and a 5% discount for payment by a particular credit card. None of these discounts is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Pursuant to section 171(c) of the act, discounts excluded from the finance charge under this paragraph are also excluded from treatment as a finance charge or other charge for credit under any state usury or disclosure laws.</p><p class="depth0">3. Determination of the regular price.</p><p class="depth0">i. The regular price is critical in determining whether the difference between the price charged to cash customers and credit customers is a discount or a surcharge, as these terms are defined in amended section 103 of the act. The regular price is defined in section 103 of the act as--</p><p class="depth0">* * * the tag or posted price charged for the property or service if a single price is tagged or posted, or the price charged for the property or service when payment is made by use of an open-end credit account or a credit card if either (1) no price is tagged or posted, or (2) two prices are tagged or posted. * * *</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, in the sale of motor vehicle fuel, the tagged or posted price is the price displayed at the pump. As a result, the higher price (the open-end credit or credit card price) must be displayed at the pump, either alone or along with the cash price. Service station operators may designate separate pumps or separate islands as being for either cash or credit purchases and display only the appropriate prices at the various pumps. If a pump is capable of displaying on its meter either a cash or a credit price depending upon the consumer's means of payment, both the cash price and the credit price must be displayed at the pump. A service station operator may display the cash price of fuel by itself on a curb sign, as long as the sign clearly indicates that the price is limited to cash purchases.</p><p class="depth0">4(b)(10) Debt cancellation and debt suspension fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a specified event occurs. The term ``debt cancellation coverage'' includes guaranteed automobile protection, or ``GAP,'' agreements, which pay or satisfy the remaining debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted. Debt suspension coverage provides for suspension of the obligation to make one or more payments on the date(s) otherwise required by the credit agreement, when a specified event occurs. The term ``debt suspension'' does not include loan payment deferral arrangements in which the triggering event is the bank's unilateral decision to allow a deferral of payment and the borrower's unilateral election to do so, such as by skipping or reducing one or more payments (``skip payments'').</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage written in connection with a transaction. Coverage sold after consummation in closed-end credit transactions or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b is not ``written in connection with'' the credit transaction if the coverage is written because the consumer requests coverage after consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b (although credit-sale disclosures may be required for the coverage sold after consummation if it is financed). Coverage sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is opened is considered ``written in connection with a credit transaction.''</p><p class="depth0">4(c) Charges excluded from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Application fees. An application fee that is excluded from the finance charge is a charge to recover the costs associated with processing applications for credit. The fee may cover the costs of services such as credit reports, credit investigations, and appraisals. The creditor is free to impose the fee in only certain of its loan programs, such as mortgage loans. However, if the fee is to be excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1), it must be charged to all applicants, not just to applicants who are approved or who actually receive credit.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment charges.</p><p class="depth0">i. Late payment charges can be excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(2) whether or not the person imposing the charge continues to extend credit on the account or continues to provide property or services to the consumer. In determining whether a charge is for actual unanticipated late payment on a 30-day account, for example, factors to be considered include:</p><p class="depth0">A. The terms of the account. For example, is the consumer required by the account terms to pay the account balance in full each month? If not, the charge may be a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">B. The practices of the creditor in handling the accounts. For example, regardless of the terms of the account, does the creditor allow consumers to pay the accounts over a period of time without demanding payment in full or taking other action to collect? If no effort is made to collect the full amount due, the charge may be a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 226.4(c)(2) applies to late payment charges imposed for failure to make payments as agreed, as well as failure to pay an account in full when due.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other excluded charges. Charges for ``delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence'' include, for example, charges for reinstatement of credit privileges or for submitting as payment a check that is later returned unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Assessing interest on an overdraft balance. A charge on an overdraft balance computed by applying a rate of interest to the amount of the overdraft is not a finance charge, even though the consumer agrees to the charge in the account agreement, unless the financial institution agrees in writing that it will pay such items.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Participation fees--periodic basis. The participation fees described in Sec. 226.4(c)(4) do not necessarily have to be formal membership fees, nor are they limited to credit card plans. The provision applies to any credit plan in which payment of a fee is a condition of access to the plan itself, but it does not apply to fees imposed separately on individual closed-end transactions. The fee may be charged on a monthly, annual, or other periodic basis; a one-time, non-recurring fee imposed at the time an account is opened is not a fee that is charged on a periodic basis, and may not be treated as a participation fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Participation fees--exclusions. Minimum monthly charges, charges for non-use of a credit card, and other charges based on either account activity or the amount of credit available under the plan are not excluded from the finance charge by Sec. 226.4(c)(4). Thus, for example, a fee that is charged and then refunded to the consumer based on the extent to which the consumer uses the credit available would be a finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(b)(2). Also, see comment 14(c)-2 for treatment of certain types of fees excluded in determining the annual percentage rate for the periodic statement.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Seller's points. The seller's points mentioned in Sec. 226.4(c)(5) include any charges imposed by the creditor upon the noncreditor seller of property for providing credit to the buyer or for providing credit on certain terms. These charges are excluded from the finance charge even if they are passed on to the buyer, for example, in the form of a higher sales price. Seller's points are frequently involved in real estate transactions guaranteed or insured by governmental agencies. A commitment fee paid by a noncreditor seller (such as a real estate developer) to the creditor should be treated as seller's points. Buyer's points (that is, points charged to the buyer by the creditor), however, are finance charges.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other seller-paid amounts. Mortgage insurance premiums and other finance charges are sometimes paid at or before consummation or settlement on the borrower's behalf by a noncreditor seller. The creditor should treat the payment made by the seller as seller's points and exclude it from the finance charge if, based on the seller's payment, the consumer is not legally bound to the creditor for the charge. A creditor who gives disclosures before the payment has been made should base them on the best information reasonably available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0">1. Lost interest. Certain federal and state laws mandate a percentage differential between the interest rate paid on a deposit and the rate charged on a loan secured by that deposit. In some situations, because of usury limits the creditor must reduce the interest rate paid on the deposit and, as a result, the consumer loses some of the interest that would otherwise have been earned. Under Sec. 226.4(c)(6), such ``lost interest'' need not be included in the finance charge. This rule applies only to an interest reduction imposed because a rate differential is required by law

and a usury limit precludes compliance by any other means. If the creditor imposes a differential that exceeds that required, only the lost interest attributable to the excess amount is a finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(a).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0">1. Real estate or residential mortgage transaction charges. The list of charges in Sec. 226.4(c)(7) applies both to residential mortgage transactions (which may include, for example, the purchase of a mobile home) and to other transactions secured by real estate. The fees are excluded from the finance charge even if the services for which the fees are imposed are performed by the creditor's employees rather than by a third party. In addition, the cost of verifying or confirming information connected to the item is also excluded. For example, credit-report fees cover not only the cost of the report but also the cost of verifying information in the report. In all cases, charges excluded under Sec. 226.4(c)(7) must be bona fide and reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lump-sum charges. If a lump sum charged for several services includes a charge that is not excludable, a portion of the total should be allocated to that service and included in the finance charge. However, a lump sum charged for conducting or attending a closing (for example, by a lawyer or a title company) is excluded from the finance charge if the charge is primarily for services related to items listed in Sec. 226.4(c)(7) (for example, reviewing or completing documents), even if other incidental services such as explaining various documents or disbursing funds for the parties are performed. The entire charge is excluded even if a fee for the incidental services would be a finance charge if it were imposed separately.</p><p class="depth0">3. Charges assessed during the loan term. Real estate or residential mortgage transaction charges excluded under Sec. 226.4(c)(7) are those charges imposed solely in connection with the initial decision to grant credit. This would include, for example, a fee to search for tax liens on the property or to determine if flood insurance is required. The exclusion does not apply to fees for services to be performed periodically during the loan term, regardless of when the fee is collected. For example, a fee for one or more determinations during the loan term of the current tax-lien status or flood-insurance requirements is a finance charge, regardless of whether the fee is imposed at closing, or when the service is performed. If a creditor is uncertain about what portion of a fee to be paid at consummation or loan closing is related to the initial decision to grant credit, the entire fee may be treated as a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4(d) Insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.4(d) permits insurance premiums and charges and debt cancellation and debt suspension charges to be excluded from the finance charge. The required disclosures must be made in writing, except as provided in Sec. 226.4(d)(4). The rules on location of insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension disclosures for closed-end transactions are in Sec. 226.17(a). For purposes of Sec. 226.4(d), all references to insurance also include debt cancellation and debt suspension coverage unless the context indicates otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing of disclosures. If disclosures are given early, for example under Sec. 226.17(f) or Sec. 226.19(a), the creditor need not redisclose if the actual premium is different at the time of consummation. If insurance disclosures are not given at the time of early disclosure and insurance is in fact written in connection with the transaction, the disclosures under Sec. 226.4(d) must be made in order to exclude the premiums from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">3. Premium rate increases. The creditor should disclose the premium amount based on the rates currently in effect and need not designate it as an estimate even if the premium rates may increase. An increase in insurance rates after consummation of a closed-end credit transaction or during the life of an open-end credit plan does not require redisclosure in order to exclude the additional premium from treatment as a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unit-cost disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">i. Open-end credit. The premium or fee for insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension for the initial term of coverage may be disclosed on a unit-cost basis in open-end credit transactions. The cost per unit should be based on the initial term of coverage, unless one of the options under comment 4(d)-12 is available.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Closed-end credit. One of the transactions for which unit-cost disclosures (such as 50 cents per year for each $100 of the amount financed) may be used in place of the total insurance premium involves a particular kind of insurance plan. For example, a consumer with a current indebtedness of $8,000 is covered by a plan of credit life insurance coverage with a maximum of $10,000. The consumer requests an additional $4,000 loan to be covered by the same insurance plan. Since the $4,000 loan exceeds, in part, the maximum amount of indebtedness that can be covered by the plan, the creditor may properly give the insurance-cost disclosures on the $4,000 loan on a unit-cost basis.</p><p class="depth0">5. Required credit life insurance; debt cancellation or suspension coverage. Credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance, and debt cancellation and suspension coverage described in Sec. 226.4(b)(10), must be voluntary in order for the premium or charges to be excluded from the finance charge. Whether the insurance or coverage is in fact required or optional is a factual question. If the insurance or coverage is required,

the premiums must be included in the finance charge, whether the insurance or coverage is purchased from the creditor or from a third party. If the consumer is required to elect one of several options--such as to purchase credit life insurance, or to assign an existing life insurance policy, or to pledge security such as a certificate of deposit--and the consumer purchases the credit life insurance policy, the premium must be included in the finance charge. (If the consumer assigns a preexisting policy or pledges security instead, no premium is included in the finance charge. The security interest would be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(a)(4), Sec. 226.6(b)(5)(ii), or Sec. 226.18(m). See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(b)(7) and (b)(8).)</p><p class="depth0">6. Other types of voluntary insurance. Insurance is not credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance if the creditor or the credit account of the consumer is not the beneficiary of the insurance coverage. If the premium for such insurance is not imposed by the creditor as an incident to or a condition of credit, it is not covered by Sec. 226.4.</p><p class="depth0">7. Signatures. If the creditor offers a number of insurance options under Sec. 226.4(d), the creditor may provide a means for the consumer to sign or initial for each option, or it may provide for a single authorizing signature or initial with the options selected designated by some other means, such as a check mark. The insurance authorization may be signed or initialed by any consumer, as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(11), or by an authorized user on a credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Property insurance. To exclude property insurance premiums or charges from the finance charge, the creditor must allow the consumer to choose the insurer and disclose that fact. This disclosure must be made whether or not the property insurance is available from or through the creditor. The requirement that an option be given does not require that the insurance be readily available from other sources. The premium or charge must be disclosed only if the consumer elects to purchase the insurance from the creditor; in such a case, the creditor must also disclose the term of the property insurance coverage if it is less than the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">9. Single-interest insurance. Blanket and specific single-interest coverage are treated the same for purposes of the regulation. A charge for either type of single-interest insurance may be excluded from the finance charge if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The insurer waives any right of subrogation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The other requirements of Sec. 226.4(d)(2) are met. This includes, of course, giving the consumer the option of obtaining the insurance from a person of the consumer's choice. The creditor need not ascertain whether the consumer is able to purchase the insurance from someone else.</p><p class="depth0">10. Single-interest insurance defined. The term single-interest insurance as used in the regulation refers only to the types of coverage traditionally included in the term vendor's single-interest insurance (or VSI), that is, protection of tangible property against normal property damage, concealment, confiscation, conversion, embezzlement, and skip. Some comprehensive insurance policies may include a variety of additional coverages, such as repossession insurance and holder-in-due-course insurance. These types of coverage do not constitute single-interest insurance for purposes of the regulation, and premiums for them do not qualify for exclusion from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(d). If a policy that is primarily VSI also provides coverages that are not VSI or other property insurance, a portion of the premiums must be allocated to the nonexcludable coverages and included in the finance charge. However, such allocation is not required if the total premium in fact attributable to all of the non-VSI coverages included in the policy is $1.00 or less (or $5.00 or less in the case of a multiyear policy).</p><p class="depth0">11. Initial term.</p><p class="depth0">i. The initial term of insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage determines the period for which a premium amount must be disclosed, unless one of the options discussed under comment 4(d)-12 is available. For purposes of Sec. 226.4(d), the initial term is the period for which the insurer or creditor is obligated to provide coverage, even though the consumer may be allowed to cancel the coverage or coverage may end due to nonpayment before that term expires.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial term of a property insurance policy on an automobile that is written for one year is one year even though premiums are paid monthly and the term of the credit transaction is four years.</p><p class="depth0">B. The initial term of an insurance policy is the full term of the credit transaction if the consumer pays or finances a single premium in advance.</p><p class="depth0">12. Initial term; alternative.</p><p class="depth0">i. General. A creditor has the option of providing cost disclosures on the basis of one year of insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage instead of a longer initial term (provided the premium or fee is clearly labeled as being for one year) if:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial term is indefinite or not clear, or</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee that is assessed periodically but the consumer is under no obligation to continue the coverage, whether or not the consumer has made an initial payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Open-end plans. For open-end plans, a creditor also has the option of providing unit-cost disclosure on the basis of a period that is less than one year if the consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee that is

assessed periodically, for example monthly, but the consumer is under no obligation to continue the coverage.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">A. A credit life insurance policy providing coverage for a 30-year mortgage loan has an initial term of 30 years, even though premiums are paid monthly and the consumer is not required to continue the coverage. Disclosures may be based on the initial term, but the creditor also has the option of making disclosures on the basis of coverage for an assumed initial term of one year.</p><p class="depth0">13. Loss-of-income insurance. The loss-of-income insurance mentioned in Sec. 226.4(d) includes involuntary unemployment insurance, which provides that some or all of the consumer's payments will be made if the consumer becomes unemployed involuntarily.</p><p class="depth0">4(d)(3) Voluntary debt cancellation or debt suspension fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Fees charged for the specialized form of debt cancellation agreement known as guaranteed automobile protection (``GAP'') agreements must be disclosed according to Sec. 226.4(d)(3) rather than according to Sec. 226.4(d)(2) for property insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosures. Creditors can comply with Sec. 226.4(d)(3) by providing a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage constitutes insurance under state law. (See Model Clauses and Samples at G-16 and H-17 in appendix G and appendix H to part 226 for guidance on how to provide the disclosure required by Sec. 226.4(d)(3)(iii) for debt suspension products.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple events. If debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage for two or more events is provided at a single charge, the entire charge may be excluded from the finance charge if at least one of the events is accident or loss of life, health, or income and the conditions specified in Sec. 226.4(d)(3) or, as applicable, Sec. 226.4(d)(4), are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosures in programs combining debt cancellation and debt suspension features. If the consumer's debt can be cancelled under certain circumstances, the disclosure may be modified to reflect that fact. The disclosure could, for example, state (in addition to the language required by Sec. 226.4(d)(3)(iii)) that ``In some circumstances, my debt may be cancelled.'' However, the disclosure would not be permitted to list the specific events that would result in debt cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">4(d)(4) Telephone purchases.</p><p class="depth0">1. Affirmative request. A creditor would not satisfy the requirement to obtain a consumer's affirmative request if the ``request'' was a response to a script that uses leading questions or negative consent. A question asking whether the consumer wishes to enroll in the credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension plan and seeking a yes-or-no response (such as ``Do you want to enroll in this optional debt cancellation plan?'') would not be considered leading.</p><p class="depth0">4(e) Certain security interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. Excludable charges. Sums must be actually paid to public officials to be excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(e)(1) and (e)(3). Examples are charges or other fees required for filing or recording security agreements, mortgages, continuation statements, termination statements, and similar documents, as well as intangible property or other taxes even when the charges or fees are imposed by the state solely on the creditor and charged to the consumer (if the tax must be paid to record a security agreement). (See comment 4(a)-5 regarding the treatment of taxes, generally.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Charges not excludable. If the obligation is between the creditor and a third party (an assignee, for example), charges or other fees for filing or recording security agreements, mortgages, continuation statements, termination statements, and similar documents relating to that obligation are not excludable from the finance charge under this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization. The various charges described in Sec. 226.4(e)(1) and (e)(3) may be totaled and disclosed as an aggregate sum, or they may be itemized by the specific fees and taxes imposed. If an aggregate sum is disclosed, a general term such as security interest fees or filing fees may be used.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notary fees. In order for a notary fee to be excluded under Sec. 226.4(e)(1), all of the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The document to be notarized is one used to perfect, release, or continue a security interest.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The document is required by law to be notarized.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A notary is considered a public official under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The amount of the fee is set or authorized by law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nonfiling insurance. The exclusion in Sec. 226.4(e)(2) is available only if nonfiling insurance is purchased. If the creditor collects and simply retains a fee as a sort of ``self-insurance'' against nonfiling, it may not be excluded from the finance charge. If the nonfiling insurance premium exceeds the amount of the fees excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(e)(1), only the excess is a finance charge. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The fee for perfecting a security interest is $5.00 and the fee for releasing the security interest is $3.00. The creditor charges $10.00 for nonfiling insurance. Only $8.00 of the $10.00 is excludable from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4(f) Prohibited offsets.</p><p class="depth0">1. Earnings on deposits or investments. The rule that the creditor shall not deduct any

earnings by the consumer on deposits or investments applies whether or not the creditor has a security interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart B--Open-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.5--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">5(a) Form of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5(a)(1) General.</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard. The ``clear and conspicuous'' standard generally requires that disclosures be in a reasonably understandable form. Disclosures for credit card applications and solicitations under Sec. 226.5a, highlighted account-opening disclosures under Sec. 226.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosure on checks that access a credit card under Sec. 226.9(b)(3), highlighted change-in-terms disclosures under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(D), and highlighted disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or for a penalty under Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(ii) must also be readily noticeable to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous--reasonably understandable form. Except where otherwise provided, the reasonably understandable form standard does not require that disclosures be segregated from other material or located in any particular place on the disclosure statement, or that numerical amounts or percentages be in any particular type size. For disclosures that are given orally, the standard requires that they be given at a speed and volume sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them. (See comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1.) Except where otherwise provided, the standard does not prohibit:</p><p class="depth0">i. Pluralizing required terminology (``finance charge'' and ``annual percentage rate'').</p><p class="depth0">ii. Adding to the required disclosures such items as contractual provisions, explanations of contract terms, state disclosures, and translations.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Sending promotional material with the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Using commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations (such as ``mo.'' for ``month'' or ``Tx.'' for ``Texas'') in making any required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">v. Using codes or symbols such as ``APR'' (for annual percentage rate), ``FC'' (for finance charge), or ``Cr'' (for credit balance), so long as a legend or description of the code or symbol is provided on the disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous--readily noticeable standard. To meet the readily noticeable standard, disclosures for credit card applications and solicitations under Sec. 226.5a, highlighted account-opening disclosures under Sec. 226.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosures on checks that access a credit card account under Sec. 226.9(b)(3), highlighted change-in-terms disclosures under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(D), and highlighted disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or penalty pricing under Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(ii) must be given in a minimum of 10-point font. (See special rule for font size requirements for the annual percentage rate for purchases under Sec. Sec. 226.5a(b)(1) and 226.6(b)(2)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Integrated document. The creditor may make both the account-opening disclosures (Sec. 226.6) and the periodic-statement disclosures (Sec. 226.7) on more than one page, and use both the front and the reverse sides, except where otherwise indicated, so long as the pages constitute an integrated document. An integrated document would not include disclosure pages provided to the consumer at different times or disclosures interspersed on the same page with promotional material. An integrated document would include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Multiple pages provided in the same envelope that cover related material and are folded together, numbered consecutively, or clearly labeled to show that they relate to one another; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. A brochure that contains disclosures and explanatory material about a range of services the creditor offers, such as credit, checking account, and electronic fund transfer features.</p><p class="depth0">5. Disclosures covered. Disclosures that must meet the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard include all required communications under this subpart. Therefore, disclosures made by a person other than the card issuer, such as disclosures of finance charges imposed at the time of honoring a consumer's credit card under Sec. 226.9(d), and notices, such as the correction notice required to be sent to the consumer under Sec. 226.13(e), must also be clear and conspicuous.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(a)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Electronic disclosures. Disclosures that need not be provided in writing under Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) may be provided in writing, orally, or in electronic form. If the consumer requests the service in electronic form, such as on the creditor's Web site, the specified disclosures may be provided in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures not subject to E-Sign Act. See the commentary to Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) regarding disclosures (in addition to those specified under Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(iii)) that may be provided in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">5(a)(2) Terminology.</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. For home-equity plans subject to Sec. 226.5b, the terms finance charge and annual percentage rate, when required to be used with a number, must be disclosed more conspicuously than other required disclosures, except in

the cases provided in Sec. 226.5(a)(2)(ii). At the creditor's option, finance charge and annual percentage rate may also be disclosed more conspicuously than the other required disclosures even when the regulation does not so require. The following examples illustrate these rules:</p><p class="depth0">i. In disclosing the annual percentage rate as required by Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii), the term annual percentage rate is subject to the more conspicuous rule.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In disclosing the amount of the finance charge, required by Sec. 226.7(a)(6)(i), the term finance charge is subject to the more conspicuous rule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Although neither finance charge nor annual percentage rate need be emphasized when used as part of general informational material or in textual descriptions of other terms, emphasis is permissible in such cases. For example, when the terms appear as part of the explanations required under Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv), they may be equally conspicuous as the disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) and 226.7(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. In disclosing the terms finance charge and annual percentage rate more conspicuously for home-equity plans subject to Sec. 226.5b, only the words finance charge and annual percentage rate should be accentuated. For example, if the term total finance charge is used, only finance charge should be emphasized. The disclosures may be made more conspicuous by, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Capitalizing the words when other disclosures are printed in lower case.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Putting them in bold print or a contrasting color.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Underlining them.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Setting them off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">v. Printing them in larger type.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of figures--exception to more conspicuous rule. For home-equity plans subject to Sec. 226.5b, the terms annual percentage rate and finance charge need not be more conspicuous than figures (including, for example, numbers, percentages, and dollar signs).</p><p class="depth0">4. Consistent terminology. Language used in disclosures required in this subpart must be close enough in meaning to enable the consumer to relate the different disclosures; however, the language need not be identical.</p><p class="depth0">5(b) Time of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1) Account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(i) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure before the first transaction. When disclosures must be furnished ``before the first transaction,'' account-opening disclosures must be delivered before the consumer becomes obligated on the plan. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Purchases. The consumer makes the first purchase, such as when a consumer opens a credit plan and makes purchases contemporaneously at a retail store, except when the consumer places a telephone call to make the purchase and opens the plan contemporaneously. (See commentary to Sec. 226.5(b)(1)(iii) below.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Advances. The consumer receives the first advance. If the consumer receives a cash advance check at the same time the account-opening disclosures are provided, disclosures are still timely if the consumer can, after receiving the disclosures, return the cash advance check to the creditor without obligation (for example, without paying finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">2. Reactivation of suspended account. If an account is temporarily suspended (for example, because the consumer has exceeded a credit limit, or because a credit card is reported lost or stolen) and then is reactivated, no new account-opening disclosures are required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reopening closed account. If an account has been closed (for example, due to inactivity, cancellation, or expiration) and then is reopened, new account-opening disclosures are required. No new account-opening disclosures are required, however, when the account is closed merely to assign it a new number (for example, when a credit card is reported lost or stolen) and the ``new'' account then continues on the same terms.</p><p class="depth0">4. Converting closed-end to open-end credit. If a closed-end credit transaction is converted to an open-end credit account under a written agreement with the consumer, account-opening disclosures under Sec. 226.6 must be given before the consumer becomes obligated on the open-end credit plan. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17 on converting open-end credit to closed-end credit.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Balance transfers. A creditor that solicits the transfer by a consumer of outstanding balances from an existing account to a new open-end plan must furnish the disclosures required by Sec. 226.6 so that the consumer has an opportunity, after receiving the disclosures, to contact the creditor before the balance is transferred and decline the transfer. For example, assume a consumer responds to a card issuer's solicitation for a credit card account subject to Sec. 226.5a that offers a range of balance transfer annual percentage rates, based on the consumer's creditworthiness. If the creditor opens an account for the consumer, the creditor would comply with the timing rules of this section by providing the consumer with the annual percentage rate (along with the fees and other required disclosures) that would apply to the balance transfer in time for the consumer to contact the creditor and withdraw the request. A creditor that permits consumers to withdraw the request by telephone has met this timing standard if the creditor does not effect the balance transfer until 10 days after the creditor has sent account-opening disclosures to the consumer, assuming the consumer has not contacted the creditor to withdraw the request. Card issuers that are subject to the

requirements of Sec. 226.5a may establish procedures that comply with both Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.6 in a single disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">6. Substitution or replacement of credit card accounts.</p><p class="depth0">i. Generally. When a card issuer substitutes or replaces an existing credit card account with another credit card account, the card issuer must either provide notice of the terms of the new account consistent with Sec. 226.6(b) or provide notice of the changes in the terms of the existing account consistent with Sec. 226.9(c)(2). Whether a substitution or replacement results in the opening of a new account or a change in the terms of an existing account for purposes of the disclosure requirements in Sec. Sec. 226.6(b) and 226.9(c)(2) is determined in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances. For additional requirements and limitations related to the substitution or replacement of credit card accounts, see Sec. Sec. 226.12(a) and 226.55(d) and comments 12(a)(1)-1 through -8, 12(a)(2)-1 through -9, 55(b)(3)-3, and 55(d)-1 through -3.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relevant facts and circumstances. Listed below are facts and circumstances that are relevant to whether a substitution or replacement results in the opening of a new account or a change in the terms of an existing account for purposes of the disclosure requirements in Sec. Sec. 226.6(b) and 226.9(c)(2). When most of the facts and circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement likely constitutes the opening of a new account for which Sec. 226.6(b) disclosures are appropriate. When few of the facts and circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement likely constitutes a change in the terms of an existing account for which Sec. 226.9(c)(2) disclosures are appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">A. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new credit card;</p><p class="depth0">B. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new account number;</p><p class="depth0">C. Whether the account provides new features or benefits after the substitution or replacement (such as rewards on purchases);</p><p class="depth0">D. Whether the account can be used to conduct transactions at a greater or lesser number of merchants after the substitution or replacement (such as when a retail card is replaced with a cobranded general purpose credit card that can be used at a wider number of merchants);</p><p class="depth0">E. Whether the card issuer implemented the substitution or replacement on an individualized basis (such as in response to a consumer's request); and</p><p class="depth0">F. Whether the account becomes a different type of open-end plan after the substitution or replacement (such as when a charge card is replaced by a credit card).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Replacement as a result of theft or unauthorized use. Notwithstanding paragraphs i. and ii. above, a card issuer that replaces a credit card or provides a new account number because the consumer has reported the card stolen or because the account appears to have been used for unauthorized transactions is not required to provide a notice under Sec. Sec. 226.6(b) or 226.9(c)(2) unless the card issuer has changed a term of the account that is subject to Sec. Sec. 226.6(b) or 226.9(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(ii) Charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosing charges before the fee is imposed. Creditors may disclose charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan orally or in writing at any time before a consumer agrees to pay the fee or becomes obligated for the charge, unless the charge is specified under Sec. 226.6(b)(2). (Charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured plan) that are not specified under Sec. 226.6(b)(2) may alternatively be disclosed in electronic form; see the commentary to Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(ii)(A).) Creditors must provide such disclosures at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice them. For example, if a consumer telephones a card issuer to discuss a particular service, a creditor would meet the standard if the creditor clearly and conspicuously discloses the fee associated with the service that is the topic of the telephone call orally to the consumer. Similarly, a creditor providing marketing materials in writing to a consumer about a particular service would meet the standard if the creditor provided a clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the fee for that service in those same materials. A creditor that provides written materials to a consumer about a particular service but provides a fee disclosure for another service not promoted in such materials would not meet the standard. For example, if a creditor provided marketing materials promoting payment by Internet, but included the fee for a replacement card on such materials with no explanation, the creditor would not be disclosing the fee at a time and in a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice the fee.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(iii) Telephone purchases.</p><p class="depth0">1. Return policies. In order for creditors to provide disclosures in accordance with the timing requirements of this paragraph, consumers must be permitted to return merchandise purchased at the time the plan was established without paying mailing or return-shipment costs. Creditors may impose costs to return subsequent purchases of merchandise under the plan, or to return merchandise purchased by other means such as a credit card issued by another creditor. A reasonable return policy would be of sufficient duration that the consumer is likely to have received the disclosures and had sufficient time to make a decision about the financing plan before his or her right to return the goods expires. Return policies need not provide a right to return goods if the consumer

consumes or damages the goods, or for installed appliances or fixtures, provided there is a reasonable repair or replacement policy to cover defective goods or installations. If the consumer chooses to reject the financing plan, creditors comply with the requirements of this paragraph by permitting the consumer to pay for the goods with another reasonable form of payment acceptable to the merchant and keep the goods although the creditor cannot require the consumer to do so.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(iv) Membership fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Membership fees. See Sec. 226.5a(b)(2) and related commentary for guidance on fees for issuance or availability of a credit or charge card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rejecting the plan. If a consumer has paid or promised to pay a membership fee including an application fee excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1) before receiving account-opening disclosures, the consumer may, after receiving the disclosures, reject the plan and not be obligated for the membership fee, application fee, or any other fee or charge. A consumer who has received the disclosures and uses the account, or makes a payment on the account after receiving a billing statement, is deemed not to have rejected the plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Using the account. A consumer uses an account by obtaining an extension of credit after receiving the account-opening disclosures, such as by making a purchase or obtaining an advance. A consumer does not ``use'' the account by activating the account. A consumer also does not ``use'' the account when the creditor assesses fees on the account (such as start-up fees or fees associated with credit insurance or debt cancellation or suspension programs agreed to as a part of the application and before the consumer receives account-opening disclosures). For example, the consumer does not ``use'' the account when a creditor sends a billing statement with start-up fees, there is no other activity on the account, the consumer does not pay the fees, and the creditor subsequently assesses a late fee or interest on the unpaid fee balances. A consumer also does not ``use'' the account by paying an application fee excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1) prior to receiving the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b are subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b(h) regarding the collection of fees.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(2) Periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic statements not required. Periodic statements need not be sent in the following cases:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor adjusts an account balance so that at the end of the cycle the balance is less than $1--so long as no finance charge has been imposed on the account for that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a statement was returned as undeliverable. If a new address is provided, however, within a reasonable time before the creditor must send a statement, the creditor must resume sending statements. Receiving the address at least 20 days before the end of a cycle would be a reasonable amount of time to prepare the statement for that cycle. For example, if an address is received 22 days before the end of the June cycle, the creditor must send the periodic statement for the June cycle. (See Sec. 226.13(a)(7).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Termination of draw privileges. When a consumer's ability to draw on an open-end account is terminated without being converted to closed-end credit under a written agreement, the creditor must continue to provide periodic statements to those consumers entitled to receive them under Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(i), for example, when the draw period of an open-end credit plan ends and consumers are paying off outstanding balances according to the account agreement or under the terms of a workout agreement that is not converted to a closed-end transaction. In addition, creditors must continue to follow all of the other open-end credit requirements and procedures in subpart B.</p><p class="depth0">3. Uncollectible accounts. An account is deemed uncollectible for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(i) when a creditor has ceased collection efforts, either directly or through a third party.</p><p class="depth0">4. Instituting collection proceedings. Creditors institute a delinquency collection proceeding by filing a court action or initiating an adjudicatory process with a third party. Assigning a debt to a debt collector or other third party would not constitute instituting a collection proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mailing or delivery of periodic statements. A creditor is not required to determine the specific date on which a periodic statement is mailed or delivered to an individual consumer for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii). A creditor complies with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii) if it has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than a certain number of days after the closing date of the billing cycle and adds that number of days to the 21-day or 14-day period required by Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii) when determining, as applicable, the payment due date for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), the date on which any grace period expires for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1), or the date after which the payment will be treated as late for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2). For example</p><p class="depth0">A. If a creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan or an account under an open-end

consumer credit plan that provides a grace period are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than three days after the closing date of the billing cycle, the payment due date for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the date on which any grace period expires for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) must be no less than 24 days after the closing date of the billing cycle. Similarly, in these circumstances, the limitations in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) on treating a payment as late and imposing finance charges apply for 24 days after the closing date of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. If a creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for an account under an open-end consumer credit plan that does not provide a grace period are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than five days after the closing date of the billing cycle, the date on which a payment must be received in order to avoid being treated as late for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) must be no less than 19 days after the closing date of the billing cycle. Similarly, in these circumstances, the limitation in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) on treating a payment as late for any purpose applies for 19 days after the closing date of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">2. Treating a payment as late for any purpose. Treating a payment as late for any purpose includes increasing the annual percentage rate as a penalty, reporting the consumer as delinquent to a credit reporting agency, assessing a late fee or any other fee, initiating collection activities, or terminating benefits (such as rewards on purchases) based on the consumer's failure to make a payment within a specified amount of time or by a specified date. The prohibitions in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) and (b)(2)(B)(2)(ii) on treating a payment as late for any purpose apply only during the 21-day or 14-day period (as applicable) following mailing or delivery of the periodic statement stating the due date for that payment and only if the required minimum periodic payment is received within that period. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a periodic statement mailed on April 4 states that a required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on April 25. If the card issuer does not receive any payment on or before April 25, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit the card issuer from treating the required minimum periodic payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as in paragraph i. above. On April 20, the card issuer receives a payment of $30 and no additional payment is received on or before April 25. Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit the card issuer from treating the required minimum periodic payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph i. above. On May 4, the card issuer has not received the $50 required minimum periodic payment that was due on April 25. The periodic statement mailed on May 4 states that a required minimum periodic payment of $150 is due on May 25. Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not permit the card issuer to treat the $150 required minimum periodic payment as late until April 26. However, the card issuer may continue to treat the $50 required minimum periodic payment as late during this period.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that, for an account under an open-end consumer credit plan that does not provide a grace period, a periodic statement mailed on September 10 states that a required minimum periodic payment of $100 is due on September 24. If the creditor does not receive any payment on or before September 24, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the creditor from treating the required minimum periodic payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace periods. i. Definition of grace period. For purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B), ``grace period'' means a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate. A deferred interest or similar promotional program under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time is not a grace period for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B). Similarly, a period following the payment due date during which a late payment fee will not be imposed is not a grace period for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B). See comments 7(b)(11)-1, 7(b)(11)-2, and 54(a)(1)-2.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Applicability of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1). Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) applies if an account is eligible for a grace period when the periodic statement is mailed or delivered. Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not require the creditor to provide a grace period or prohibit the creditor from placing limitations and conditions on a grace period to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec. 226.54. See comment 54(a)(1)-1. Furthermore, the prohibition in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii) applies only during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of the periodic statement and applies only when the creditor receives a payment within that 21-day period that satisfies the terms of the grace period.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Example. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth of the month. Assume also that, under the terms of the account, the balance at the end of a billing cycle must be paid in full by the following payment due date in order for the account to remain eligible for the grace period. At the end of the April billing cycle, the balance on the account is $500. The grace period applies

to the $500 balance because the balance for the March billing cycle was paid in full on April 25. Accordingly, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(i) requires the creditor to have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that the periodic statement reflecting the $500 balance is mailed or delivered on or before May 4. Furthermore, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii) requires the creditor to have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that the creditor does not impose finance charges as a result of the loss of the grace period if a $500 payment is received on or before May 25. However, if the creditor receives a payment of $300 on April 25, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii) would not prohibit the creditor from imposing finance charges as a result of the loss of the grace period (to the extent permitted by Sec. 226.54).</p><p class="depth0">4. Application of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii) to charge card and charged-off accounts. i. Charge card accounts. For purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), the payment due date for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is the date the card issuer is required to disclose on the periodic statement pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i)(A). Because Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(ii) provides that Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i) does not apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1) also does not apply to the mailing or delivery of periodic statements provided solely for such accounts. However, in these circumstances, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) requires the card issuer to have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a payment is not treated as late for any purpose during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of the statement. A card issuer that complies with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) as discussed above with respect to a charge card account has also complied with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2). Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not apply to charge card accounts because, for purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B), a grace period is a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate and, consistent with Sec. 226.2(a)(15)(iii), charge card accounts do not impose a finance charge based on a periodic rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Charged-off accounts. For purposes of Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), the payment due date for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is the date the card issuer is required to disclose on the periodic statement pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i)(A). Because Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(ii) provides that Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i) does not apply to periodic statements provided for charged-off accounts where full payment of the entire account balance is due immediately, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1) also does not apply to the mailing or delivery of periodic statements provided solely for such accounts. Furthermore, although Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) requires the card issuer to have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a payment is not treated as late for any purpose during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of the statement, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit a card issuer from continuing to treat prior payments as late during that period. See comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-2. Similarly, although Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) applies to open-end consumer credit accounts in these circumstances, Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a creditor from continuing treating prior payments as late during the 14-day period following mailing or delivery of a periodic statement. Section 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not apply to charged-off accounts where full payment of the entire account balance is due immediately because such accounts do not provide a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">5. Consumer request to pick up periodic statements. When a consumer initiates a request, the creditor may permit, but may not require, the consumer to pick up periodic statements. If the consumer wishes to pick up a statement, the statement must be made available in accordance with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Deferred interest and similar promotional programs. See comment 7(b)-1.iv.</p><p class="depth0">5(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures should reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound at the time of giving the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">i. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other law.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other grounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in the contract that evidences the agreement. But this may be rebutted if another agreement between the parties legally modifies that contract.</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimates--obtaining information. Disclosures may be estimated when the exact information is unknown at the time disclosures are made. Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time disclosures are made. The reasonably available standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. In using estimates, the creditor is not required to disclose the basis for the estimated figures, but may include such explanations as additional information. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to insurance companies for the cost of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Estimates--redisclosure. If the creditor makes estimated disclosures, redisclosure is not required for that consumer, even though

more accurate information becomes available before the first transaction. For example, in an open-end plan to be secured by real estate, the creditor may estimate the appraisal fees to be charged; such an estimate might reasonably be based on the prevailing market rates for similar appraisals. If the exact appraisal fee is determinable after the estimate is furnished but before the consumer receives the first advance under the plan, no new disclosure is necessary.</p><p class="depth0">5(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple creditors. Under Sec. 226.5(d):</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors must choose which of them will make the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather than partial disclosures from several creditors.</p><p class="depth0">iii. All disclosures for the open-end credit plan must be given, even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. Disclosures may be made to either obligor on a joint account. Disclosure responsibilities are not satisfied by giving disclosures to only a surety or guarantor for a principal obligor or to an authorized user. In rescindable transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each consumer who has the right to rescind under Sec. 226.15.</p><p class="depth0">3. Card issuer and person extending credit not the same person. Section 127(c)(4)(D) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1637(c)(4)(D)) contains rules pertaining to charge card issuers with plans that allow access to an open-end credit plan that is maintained by a person other than the charge card issuer. These rules are not implemented in Regulation Z (although they were formerly implemented in Sec. 226.5a(f)). However, the statutory provisions remain in effect and may be used by charge card issuers with plans meeting the specified criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5(e) Effect of subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0">1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after disclosures are made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be required to provide a new disclosure(s) under Sec. 226.9(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of inserts. When changes in a creditor's plan affect required disclosures, the creditor may use inserts with outdated disclosure forms. Any insert:</p><p class="depth0">i. Should clearly refer to the disclosure provision it replaces.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Need not be physically attached or affixed to the basic disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">iii. May be used only until the supply of outdated forms is exhausted.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.5a--Credit and Charge Card Applications and Solicitations</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.5a generally requires that credit disclosures be contained in application forms and solicitations initiated by a card issuer to open a credit or charge card account. (See Sec. 226.5a(a)(5) and (e)(2) for exceptions; see Sec. 226.5a(a)(1) and accompanying commentary for the definition of solicitation; see also Sec. 226.2(a)(15) and accompanying commentary for the definition of charge card.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Substitution of account-opening summary table for the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5a. In complying with Sec. 226.5a(c), (e)(1) or (f), a card issuer may provide the account-opening summary table described in Sec. 226.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5a, if the issuer provides the disclosures required by Sec. 226.6 on or with the application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to Sec. 226.5a disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5a(a) General rules.</p><p class="depth0">5a(a)(1) Definition of solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Invitations to apply. A card issuer may contact a consumer who has not been preapproved for a card account about opening an account (whether by direct mail, telephone, or other means) and invite the consumer to complete an application. Such a contact does not meet the definition of solicitation, nor is it covered by this section, unless the contact itself includes an application form in a direct mailing, electronic communication or ``take-one''; an oral application in a telephone contact initiated by the card issuer; or an application in an in-person contact initiated by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">5a(a)(2) Form of disclosures; tabular format.</p><p class="depth0">1. Location of table. i. General. Except for disclosures given electronically, disclosures in Sec. 226.5a(b) that are required to be provided in a table must be prominently located on or with the application or solicitation. Disclosures are deemed to be prominently located, for example, if the disclosures are on the same page as an application or solicitation reply form. If the disclosures appear elsewhere, they are deemed to be prominently located if the application or solicitation reply form contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that they contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Electronic disclosures. If the table is provided electronically, the table must be provided in close proximity to the application or solicitation. Card issuers have flexibility in satisfying this requirement. Methods card issuers could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">A. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application or reply form appears;</p><p class="depth0">B. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the application or reply form (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the application or reply form contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0">C. Card issuers could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application (or reply form) as long as consumers cannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application or reply form. The link would take the consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">D. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the application or reply form without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application or reply.</p><p class="depth0">Whatever method is used, a card issuer need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple accounts. If a tabular format is required to be used, card issuers offering several types of accounts may disclose the various terms for the accounts in a single table or may provide a separate table for each account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Information permitted in the table. See the commentary to Sec. 226.5a(b), (d), and (e)(1) for guidance on additional information permitted in the table.</p><p class="depth0">4. Deletion of inapplicable disclosures. Generally, disclosures need only be given as applicable. Card issuers may, therefore, omit inapplicable headings and their corresponding boxes in the table. For example, if no foreign transaction fee is imposed on the account, the heading Foreign transaction and disclosure may be deleted from the table or the disclosure form may contain the heading Foreign transaction and a disclosure showing none. There is an exception for the grace period disclosure; even if no grace period exists, that fact must be stated.</p><p class="depth0">5. Highlighting of annual percentage rates and fee amounts. i. In general. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on providing the disclosures described in Sec. 226.5a(a)(2)(iv) in bold text. Other annual percentage rates or fee amounts disclosed in the table may not be in bold text. Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) also provide guidance to issuers on how to disclose the rates and fees described in Sec. 226.5a(a)(2)(iv) in a clear and conspicuous manner, by including these rates and fees generally as the first text in the applicable rows of the table so that the highlighted rates and fees generally are aligned vertically in the table.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Maximum limits on fees. Section 226.5a(a)(2)(iv) provides that any maximum limits on fee amounts must be disclosed in bold text. For example, assume that, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a card issuer's late payment fee will not exceed $35. The maximum limit of $35 for the late payment fee must be highlighted in bold. Similarly, assume an issuer will charge a cash advance fee of $5 or 3 percent of the cash advance transaction amount, whichever is greater, but the fee will not exceed $100. The maximum limit of $100 for the cash advance fee must be highlighted in bold.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Periodic fees. Section 226.5a(a)(2)(iv) provides that any periodic fee disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.5a(b)(2) that is not an annualized amount must not be disclosed in bold. For example, if an issuer imposes a $10 monthly maintenance fee for a card account, the issuer must disclose in the table that there is a $10 monthly maintenance fee, and that the fee is $120 on an annual basis. In this example, the $10 fee disclosure would not be disclosed in bold, but the $120 annualized amount must be disclosed in bold. In addition, if an issuer must disclose any annual fee in the table, the amount of the annual fee must be disclosed in bold.</p><p class="depth0">6. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses a credit card application or solicitation electronically (other than as described under ii. below), such as on-line at a home computer, the card issuer must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application or solicitation on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application or solicitation. If the issuer instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the card issuer's office, and accesses a credit card application or solicitation electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the card issuer to provide applications or solicitations to consumers), the issuer may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the issuer complies with the timing and delivery (``on or with'') requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">7. Terminology. Section 226.5a(a)(2)(i) generally requires that the headings, content and format of the tabular disclosures be substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in appendix G-10 to part 226; but see Sec. 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to Sec. 226.5a disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5a(a)(4) Fees that vary by state.</p><p class="depth0">1. Manner of disclosing range. If the card issuer discloses a range of fees instead of disclosing the amount of the specific fee applicable to the consumer's account, the range may be stated as the lowest authorized fee (zero, if there are one or more states where no fee applies) to the highest authorized fee.</p><p class="depth0">5a(a)(5) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Noncoverage of consumer-initiated requests. Applications provided to a consumer upon request are not covered by Sec. 226.5a, even if the request is made in response to the card issuer's invitation to apply for a card account. To illustrate, if a card issuer invites consumers to call a toll-free number or to return a response card to obtain an application, the application sent in response to the consumer's request need not contain the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5a. Similarly, if the card issuer invites consumers to call and make an oral application on the telephone, Sec. 226.5a does not apply to the application made by the consumer. If, however, the card issuer calls a consumer or initiates a telephone discussion with a consumer about opening a card account and contemporaneously takes an oral application, such applications are subject to Sec. 226.5a, specifically Sec. 226.5a(d). Likewise, if the card issuer initiates an in-person discussion with a consumer about opening a card account and contemporaneously takes an application, such applications are subject to Sec. 226.5a, specifically Sec. 226.5a(f).</p><p class="depth0">5a(b) Required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Tabular format. Provisions in Sec. 226.5a(b) and its commentary provide that certain information must appear or is permitted to appear in a table. The tabular format is required for Sec. 226.5a(b) disclosures given pursuant to Sec. 226.5a(c), (d)(2), (e)(1) and (f). The tabular format does not apply to oral disclosures given pursuant to Sec. 226.5a(d)(1). (See Sec. 226.5a(a)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Accuracy. Rules concerning accuracy of the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5a(b), including variable rate disclosures, are stated in Sec. 226.5a(c)(2), (d)(3), and (e)(4), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(1) Annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate accounts--definition. For purposes of Sec. 226.5a(b)(1), a variable-rate account exists when rate changes are part of the plan and are tied to an index or formula. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.6(b)(4)(ii) for examples of variable-rate plans.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate accounts--fact that rate varies and how the rate will be determined. In describing how the applicable rate will be determined, the card issuer must identify in the table the type of index or formula used, such as the prime rate. In describing the index, the issuer may not include in the table details about the index. For example, if the issuer uses a prime rate, the issuer must disclose the rate as a ``prime rate'' and may not disclose in the table other details about the prime rate, such as the fact that it is the highest prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal two business days before the closing date of the statement for each billing period. The issuer may not disclose in the table the current value of the index (such as that the prime rate is currently 7.5 percent) or the amount of the margin or spread added to the index or formula in setting the applicable rate. A card issuer may not disclose any applicable limitations on rate increases or decreases in the table, such as describing that the rate will not go below a certain rate or higher than a certain rate. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose the fact that the applicable rate varies and how it is determined.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Discounted initial rates. i. Immediate proximity. If the term ``introductory'' is in the same phrase as the introductory rate, as that term is defined in Sec. 226.16(g)(2)(ii), it will be deemed to be in immediate proximity of the listing. For example, an issuer that uses the phrase ``introductory balance transfer APR X percent'' has used the word ``introductory'' within the same phrase as the rate. (See Sample G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the expiration date of the introductory rate and the rate that will apply after the introductory rate expires, if an introductory rate is disclosed in the table.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes in terms. The fact that an issuer may reserve the right to change a rate subsequent to account opening, pursuant to the notice requirements of Sec. 226.9(c) and the limitations in Sec. 226.55, does not, by itself, make that rate an introductory rate. For example, assume an issuer discloses an annual percentage rate for purchases of 12.99% but does not specify a time period during which that rate will be in effect. Even if that issuer subsequently increases the annual percentage rate for purchases to 15.99%, pursuant to a change-in-terms notice provided under Sec. 226.9(c), the 12.99% is not an introductory rate.</p><p class="depth0">iii. More than one introductory rate. If more than one introductory rate may apply to a particular balance in succeeding periods, the term ``introductory'' need only be used to describe the first introductory rate. For example, if an issuer offers a rate of 8.99% on purchases for six months, 10.99% on purchases for the following six months, and 14.99% on purchases after the first year, the term ``introductory'' need only be used to describe the 8.99% rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Premium initial rates--subsequent changes in terms. The fact that an issuer may reserve the right to change a rate subsequent to account opening, pursuant to the notice requirements of Sec. 226.9(c) and the limitations in Sec. 226.55 (as applicable), does not, by itself, make that rate a premium initial rate. For example, assume an issuer discloses an annual percentage rate for purchases of 18.99% but does not specify a time period during

which that rate will be in effect. Even if that issuer subsequently reduces the annual percentage rate for purchases to 15.99%, the 18.99% is not a premium initial rate. If the rate decrease is the result of a change from a non-variable rate to a variable rate or from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, see comments 9(c)(2)(v)-3 and 9(c)(2)(v)-4 for guidance on the notice requirements under Sec. 226.9(c).</p><p class="depth0">5. Increased penalty rates. i. In general. For rates that are not introductory rates or employee preferential rates, if a rate may increase as a penalty for one or more events specified in the account agreement, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the card issuer must disclose the increased rate that would apply, a brief description of the event or events that may result in the increased rate, and a brief description of how long the increased rate will remain in effect. The description of the specific event or events that may result in an increased rate should be brief. For example, if an issuer may increase a rate to the penalty rate because the consumer does not make the minimum payment by 5 p.m., Eastern Time, on its payment due date, the issuer should describe this circumstance in the table as ``make a late payment.'' Similarly, if an issuer may increase a rate that applies to a particular balance because the account is more than 60 days late, the issuer should describe this circumstance in the table as ``make a late payment.'' An issuer may not distinguish between the events that may result in an increased rate for existing balances and the events that may result in an increased rate for new transactions. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) (in the row labeled ``Penalty APR and When it Applies'') for additional guidance on the level of detail in which the specific event or events should be described.) The description of how long the increased rate will remain in effect also should be brief. If a card issuer reserves the right to apply the increased rate to any balances indefinitely, to the extent permitted by Sec. Sec. 226.55(b)(4) and 226.59, the issuer should disclose that the penalty rate may apply indefinitely. The card issuer may not disclose in the table any limitations imposed by Sec. Sec. 226.55(b)(4) and 226.59 on the duration of increased rates. For example, if the issuer generally provides that the increased rate will apply until the consumer makes twelve timely consecutive required minimum periodic payments, except to the extent that Sec. Sec. 226.55(b)(4) and 226.59 apply, the issuer should disclose that the penalty rate will apply until the consumer makes twelve consecutive timely minimum payments. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) (in the row labeled ``Penalty APR and When it Applies'') for additional guidance on the level of detail which the issuer should use to describe how long the increased rate will remain in effect.) A card issuer will be deemed to meet the standard to clearly and conspicuously disclose the information required by Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(A) if the issuer uses the format shown in Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) (in the row labeled ``Penalty APR and When it Applies'') to disclose this information.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Introductory rates--general. An issuer is required to disclose directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an introductory rate, as that term is defined in Sec. 226.16(g)(2)(ii), may be revoked, and the rate that will apply after the revocation. This information about revocation of an introductory rate and the rate that will apply after revocation must be provided even if the rate that will apply after the introductory rate is revoked is the rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional period. In a variable-rate account, the rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional period is a rate based on the applicable index or formula in accordance with the accuracy requirements set forth in Sec. 226.5a(c)(2) or (e)(4). In describing the rate that will apply after revocation of the introductory rate, if the rate that will apply after revocation of the introductory rate is already disclosed in the table, the issuer is not required to repeat the rate, but may refer to that rate in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the rate that will apply after revocation of an introductory rate is the standard rate that applies to that type of transaction (such as a purchase or balance transfer transaction), and the standard rates are labeled in the table as ``standard APRs,'' the issuer may refer to the ``standard APR'' when describing the rate that will apply after revocation of an introductory rate. (See Sample G-10(C) in the disclosure labeled ``Loss of Introductory APR'' directly beneath the table.) The description of the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked should be brief. For example, if an issuer may increase an introductory rate because the account is more than 60 days late, the issuer should describe this circumstance directly beneath the table as ``make a late payment.'' In addition, if the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked are already listed elsewhere in the table, the issuer is not required to repeat the circumstances again, but may refer to those circumstances in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked are the same as the event or events that may trigger a ``penalty rate'' as described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(A), the issuer may refer to the actions listed in the Penalty APR row, in describing the circumstances in which the introductory rate could be revoked. (See Sample G-10(C) in the disclosure labeled ``Loss of Introductory APR'' directly beneath the table for additional guidance on the level of detail in which to describe the

circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked.) A card issuer will be deemed to meet the standard to clearly and conspicuously disclose the information required by Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(B) if the issuer uses the format shown in Sample G-10(C) to disclose this information.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Introductory rates--limitations on revocation. Issuers that are disclosing an introductory rate are prohibited by Sec. 226.55 from increasing or revoking the introductory rate before it expires unless the consumer fails to make a required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for the payment. In making the required disclosure pursuant to Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(B), issuers should describe this circumstance directly beneath the table as ``make a late payment.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Employee preferential rates. An issuer is required to disclose directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an employee preferential rate may be revoked, and the rate that will apply after the revocation. In describing the rate that will apply after revocation of the employee preferential rate, if the rate that will apply after revocation of the employee preferential rate is already disclosed in the table, the issuer is not required to repeat the rate, but may refer to that rate in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the rate that will apply after revocation of an employee preferential rate is the standard rate that applies to that type of transaction (such as a purchase or balance transfer transaction), and the standard rates are labeled in the table as ``standard APRs,'' the issuer may refer to the ``standard APR'' when describing the rate that will apply after revocation of an employee preferential rate. The description of the circumstances in which an employee preferential rate could be revoked should be brief. For example, if an issuer may increase an employee preferential rate based upon termination of the employee's employment relationship with the issuer or a third party, issuers may describe this circumstance as ``if your employment with [issuer or third party] ends.''</p><p class="depth0">6. Rates that depend on consumer's creditworthiness. i. In general. The card issuer, at its option, may disclose the possible rates that may apply as either specific rates, or a range of rates. For example, if there are three possible rates that may apply (9.99, 12.99 or 17.99 percent), an issuer may disclose specific rates (9.99, 12.99 or 17.99 percent) or a range of rates (9.99 to 17.99 percent). The card issuer may not disclose only the lowest, highest or median rate that could apply. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose a range of rates.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Penalty rates. If the rate is a penalty rate, as described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv), the card issuer at its option may disclose the highest rate that could apply, instead of disclosing the specific rates or the range of rates that could apply. For example, if the penalty rate could be up to 28.99 percent, but the issuer may impose a penalty rate that is less than that rate depending on factors at the time the penalty rate is imposed, the issuer may disclose the penalty rate as ``up to'' 28.99 percent. The issuer also must include a statement that the penalty rate for which the consumer may qualify will depend on the consumer's creditworthiness, and other factors if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Other factors. Section 226.5a(b)(1)(v) applies even if other factors are used in combination with a consumer's creditworthiness to determine the rate for which a consumer may qualify at account opening. For example, Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(v) would apply if the issuer considers the type of purchase the consumer is making at the time the consumer opens the account, in combination with the consumer's creditworthiness, to determine the rate for which the consumer may qualify at account opening. If other factors are considered, the issuer should amend the statement about creditworthiness, to indicate that the rate for which the consumer may qualify at account opening will depend on the consumer's creditworthiness and other factors. Nonetheless, Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(v) does not apply if a consumer's creditworthiness is not one of the factors that will determine the rate for which the consumer may qualify at account opening (for example, if the rate is based solely on the type of purchase that the consumer is making at the time the consumer opens the account, or is based solely on whether the consumer has other banking relationships with the card issuer).</p><p class="depth0">7. Rate based on another rate on the account. In some cases, one rate may be based on another rate on the account. For example, assume that a penalty rate as described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(iv)(A) is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the current purchase rate, which is 10 percent. In this example, the card issuer in disclosing the penalty rate must disclose 15 percent as the current penalty rate. If the purchase rate is a variable rate, then the penalty rate also is a variable rate. In that case, the card issuer also must disclose the fact that the penalty rate may vary and how the rate is determined, such as ``This APR may vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.'' In describing the penalty rate, the issuer shall not disclose in the table the amount of the margin or spread added to the current purchase rate to determine the penalty rate, such as describing that the penalty rate is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the purchase rate. (See Sec. 226.5a(b)(1)(i) and comment 5a(b)(1)-2 for further guidance on describing a variable rate.)</p><p class="depth0">8. Rates. The only rates that shall be disclosed in the table are annual percentage rates determined under Sec. 226.14(b). Periodic rates shall not be disclosed in the table.</p><p class="depth0">9. Deferred interest or similar transactions. An issuer offering a deferred interest or similar plan, such as a promotional program that provides that a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time, may not disclose a 0% rate as the rate applicable to deferred interest or similar transactions if there are any circumstances under which the consumer will be obligated for interest on such transactions for the deferred interest or similar period.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(2) Fees for issuance or availability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Membership fees. Membership fees for opening an account must be disclosed under this paragraph. A membership fee to join an organization that provides a credit or charge card as a privilege of membership must be disclosed only if the card is issued automatically upon membership. Such a fee shall not be disclosed in the table if membership results merely in eligibility to apply for an account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Enhancements. Fees for optional services in addition to basic membership privileges in a credit or charge card account (for example, travel insurance or card-registration services) shall not be disclosed in the table if the basic account may be opened without paying such fees. Issuing a card to each primary cardholder (not authorized users) is considered a basic membership privilege and fees for additional cards, beyond the first card on the account, must be disclosed as a fee for issuance or availability. Thus, a fee to obtain an additional card on the account beyond the first card (so that each cardholder would have his or her own card) must be disclosed in the table as a fee for issuance or availability under Sec. 226.5a(b)(2). This fee must be disclosed even if the fee is optional; that is, if the fee is charged only if the cardholder requests one or more additional cards. (See the available credit disclosure in Sec. 226.5a(b)(14).)</p><p class="depth0">3. One-time fees. Disclosure of non-periodic fees is limited to fees related to opening the account, such as one-time membership or participation fees, or an application fee that is excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(1). The following are examples of fees that shall not be disclosed in the table</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Statement reproduction fees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Waived or reduced fees. If fees required to be disclosed are waived or reduced for a limited time, the introductory fees or the fact of fee waivers may be disclosed in the table in addition to the required fees if the card issuer also discloses how long the reduced fees or waivers will remain in effect in accordance with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and 226.55(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">5. Periodic fees and one-time fees. A card issuer disclosing a periodic fee must disclose the amount of the fee, how frequently it will be imposed, and the annualized amount of the fee. A card issuer disclosing a non-periodic fee must disclose that the fee is a one-time fee. (See Sample G-10(C) for guidance on how to meet these requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(3) Fixed finance charge; minimum interest charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of brief statement. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to provide a brief description of a minimum interest charge.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustment of $1.00 threshold amount. Consistent with Sec. 226.5a(b)(3), the Board will publish adjustments to the $1.00 threshold amount, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(4) Transaction charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges imposed by person other than card issuer. Charges imposed by a third party, such as a seller of goods, shall not be disclosed in the table under this section; the third party would be responsible for disclosing the charge under Sec. 226.9(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Foreign transaction fees. A transaction charge imposed by the card issuer for the use of the card for purchases includes any fee imposed by the issuer for purchases in a foreign currency or that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant. (See comment 4(a)-4 for guidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered charged by the card issuer.) If an issuer charges the same foreign transaction fee for purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency, or that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant, the issuer may disclose this foreign transaction fee as shown in Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C). Otherwise, the issuer must revise the foreign transaction fee language shown in Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) to disclose clearly and conspicuously the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to purchases and the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(5) Grace period.</p><p class="depth0">1. How grace period disclosure is made. The card issuer must state any conditions on the applicability of the grace period. An issuer, however, may not disclose under Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) the limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 226.54, or the impact of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on purchases as a result of a loss of a grace period. Some issuers may offer a grace period on all purchases under which interest will not be charged on purchases if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) requires that the issuer disclose the grace period and the conditions for its applicability using the following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you

any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.'' However, other issuers may offer a grace period on all purchases under which interest may be charged on purchases even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) requires the issuer to amend the above disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period.</p><p class="depth0">2. No grace period. The issuer may use the following language to describe that no grace period on any purchases is offered, as applicable: ``We will begin charging interest on purchases on the transaction date.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace period on some purchases. If the issuer provides a grace period on some types of purchases but no grace period on others, the issuer may combine and revise the language in comments 5a(b)(5)-1 and -2 as appropriate to describe to which types of purchases a grace period applies and to which types of purchases no grace period is offered.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(6) Balance computation method.</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosure. In cases where the card issuer uses a balance computation method that is identified by name in Sec. 226.5a(g), the card issuer must disclose below the table only the name of the method. In cases where the card issuer uses a balance computation method that is not identified by name in Sec. 226.5a(g), the disclosure below the table must clearly explain the method in as much detail as set forth in the descriptions of balance methods in Sec. 226.5a(g). The explanation need not be as detailed as that required for the disclosures under Sec. 226.6(b)(4)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">2. Determining the method. In determining which balance computation method to disclose for purchases, the card issuer must assume that a purchase balance will exist at the end of any grace period. Thus, for example, if the average daily balance method will include new purchases only if purchase balances are not paid within the grace period, the card issuer would disclose the name of the average daily balance method that includes new purchases. The card issuer must not assume the existence of a purchase balance, however, in making other disclosures under Sec. 226.5a(b).</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(7) Statement on charge card payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability and content. The disclosure that charges are payable upon receipt of the periodic statement is applicable only to charge card accounts. In making this disclosure, the card issuer may make such modifications as are necessary to more accurately reflect the circumstances of repayment under the account. For example, the disclosure might read, ``Charges are due and payable upon receipt of the periodic statement and must be paid no later than 15 days after receipt of such statement.''</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(8) Cash advance fee.</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the cash advance fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Foreign cash advances. Cash advance fees required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.5a(b)(8) include any charge imposed by the card issuer for cash advances in a foreign currency or that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant. (See comment 4(a)-4 for guidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered charged by the card issuer.) If an issuer charges the same foreign transaction fee for purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency or that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant, the issuer may disclose this foreign transaction fee as shown in Samples G-10(B) and (C). Otherwise, the issuer must revise the foreign transaction fee language shown in Samples G-10(B) and (C) to disclose clearly and conspicuously the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to purchases and the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">3. ATM fees. An issuer is not required to disclose pursuant to Sec. 226.5a(b)(8) any charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(9) Late payment fee.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The disclosure of the fee for a late payment includes only those fees that will be imposed for actual, unanticipated late payments. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(c)(2) for additional guidance on late payment fees. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the late payment fee.)</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(10) Over-the-limit fee.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit limit does not include fees for other types of default or for services related to exceeding the limit. For example, no disclosure is required of fees for reinstating credit privileges or fees for the dishonor of checks on an account that, if paid, would cause the credit limit to be exceeded. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the over-the-limit fee.)</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(13) Required insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension coverage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. See Sample G-10(B) for guidance on how to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.5a(b)(13).</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(14) Available credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating available credit. If the 15 percent threshold test is met, the issuer must disclose the available credit excluding optional fees, and the available credit including optional fees. In calculating the available credit to disclose in the table, the issuer

must consider all fees for the issuance or availability of credit described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(2), and any security deposit, that will be imposed and charged to the account when the account is opened, such as one-time issuance and set-up fees. For example, in calculating the available credit, issuers must consider the first year's annual fee and the first month's maintenance fee (as applicable) if they are charged to the account on the first billing statement. In calculating the amount of the available credit including optional fees, if optional fees could be charged multiple times, the issuer shall assume that the optional fee is only imposed once. For example, if an issuer charges a fee for each additional card issued on the account, the issuer in calculating the amount of the available credit including optional fees may assume that the cardholder requests only one additional card. In disclosing the available credit, the issuer shall round down the available credit amount to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content. See Sample G-10(C) for guidance on how to provide the disclosure required by Sec. 226.5a(b)(14) clearly and conspicuously.</p><p class="depth0">5a(b)(15) Web site reference.</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on disclosing a reference to the Web site established by the Board and a statement that consumers may obtain on the Web site information about shopping for and using credit card accounts.</p><p class="depth0">5a(c) Direct mail and electronic applications and solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mailed publications. Applications or solicitations contained in generally available publications mailed to consumers (such as subscription magazines) are subject to the requirements applicable to take-ones in Sec. 226.5a(e), rather than the direct mail requirements of Sec. 226.5a(c). However, if a primary purpose of a card issuer's mailing is to offer credit or charge card accounts--for example, where a card issuer ``prescreens'' a list of potential cardholders using credit criteria, and then mails to the targeted group its catalog containing an application or a solicitation for a card account--the direct mail rules apply. In addition, a card issuer may use a single application form as a take-one (in racks in public locations, for example) and for direct mailings, if the card issuer complies with the requirements of Sec. 226.5a(c) even when the form is used as a take-one--that is, by presenting the required Sec. 226.5a disclosures in a tabular format. When used in a direct mailing, the credit term disclosures must be accurate as of the mailing date whether or not the Sec. 226.5a(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are included; when used in a take-one, the disclosures must be accurate for as long as the take-one forms remain available to the public if the Sec. 226.5a(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are omitted. (If those disclosures are included in the take-one, the credit term disclosures need only be accurate as of the printing date.)</p><p class="depth0">5a(d) Telephone applications and solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. This paragraph applies if:</p><p class="depth0">A. A telephone conversation between a card issuer and consumer may result in the issuance of a card as a consequence of an issuer-initiated offer to open an account for which the issuer does not require any application (that is, a prescreened telephone solicitation).</p><p class="depth0">B. The card issuer initiates the contact and at the same time takes application information over the telephone.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This paragraph does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0">A. Telephone applications initiated by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Situations where no card will be issued--because, for example, the consumer indicates that he or she does not want the card, or the card issuer decides either during the telephone conversation or later not to issue the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Right to reject the plan. The right to reject the plan referenced in this paragraph is the same as the right to reject the plan described in Sec. 226.5(b)(1)(iv). If an issuer substitutes the account-opening summary table described in Sec. 226.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures specified in Sec. 226.5a(d)(2)(ii), the disclosure specified in Sec. 226.5a(d)(2)(ii)(B) must appear in the table, if the issuer is required to do so pursuant to Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(xiii). Otherwise, the disclosure specified in Sec. 226.5a(d)(2)(ii)(B) may appear either in or outside the table containing the required credit disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Substituting account-opening table for alternative written disclosures. An issuer may substitute the account-opening summary table described in Sec. 226.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures specified in Sec. 226.5a(d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">5a(e) Applications and solicitations made available to general public.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Applications and solicitations made available to the general public include what are commonly referred to as take-one applications typically found at counters in banks and retail establishments, as well as applications contained in catalogs, magazines and other generally available publications. In the case of credit unions, this paragraph applies to applications and solicitations to open card accounts made available to those in the general field of membership.</p><p class="depth0">2. In-person applications and solicitations. In-person applications and solicitations initiated by a card issuer are subject to Sec. 226.5a(f), not Sec. 226.5a(e). (See Sec. 226.5a(f) and accompanying commentary for rules relating to in-person applications and solicitations.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Toll-free telephone number. If a card issuer, in complying with any of the disclosure options of Sec. 226.5a(e), provides a telephone number for consumers to call to obtain credit information, the number must be

toll-free for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than the one used in the card issuer's dialing area. Alternatively, a card issuer may provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to call for information and reverse the telephone charges.</p><p class="depth0">5a(e)(1) Disclosure of required credit information.</p><p class="depth0">1. Date of printing. Disclosure of the month and year fulfills the requirement to disclose the date an application was printed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosures. The disclosures specified in Sec. 226.5a(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) may appear either in or outside the table containing the required credit disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5a(e)(2) No disclosure of credit information.</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosure option available. A card issuer may use this option only if the issuer does not include on or with the application or solicitation any statement that refers to the credit disclosures required by Sec. 226.5a(b). Statements such as no annual fee, low interest rate, favorable rates, and low costs are deemed to refer to the required credit disclosures and, therefore, may not be included on or with the solicitation or application, if the card issuer chooses to use this option.</p><p class="depth0">5a(e)(3) Prompt response to requests for information.</p><p class="depth0">1. Prompt disclosure. Information is promptly disclosed if it is given within 30 days of a consumer's request for information but in no event later than delivery of the credit or charge card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information disclosed. When a consumer requests credit information, card issuers need not provide all the required credit disclosures in all instances. For example, if disclosures have been provided in accordance with Sec. 226.5a(e)(1) and a consumer calls or writes a card issuer to obtain information about changes in the disclosures, the issuer need only provide the items of information that have changed from those previously disclosed on or with the application or solicitation. If a consumer requests information about particular items, the card issuer need only provide the requested information. If, however, the card issuer has made disclosures in accordance with the option in Sec. 226.5a(e)(2) and a consumer calls or writes the card issuer requesting information about costs, all the required disclosure information must be given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Manner of response. A card issuer's response to a consumer's request for credit information may be provided orally or in writing, regardless of the manner in which the consumer's request is received by the issuer. Furthermore, the card issuer must provide the information listed in Sec. 226.5a(e)(1). Information provided in writing need not be in a tabular format.</p><p class="depth0">5a(f) In-person applications and solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. This paragraph applies if:</p><p class="depth0">A. An in-person conversation between a card issuer and a consumer may result in the issuance of a card as a consequence of an issuer-initiated offer to open an account for which the issuer does not require any application (that is, a preapproved in-person solicitation).</p><p class="depth0">B. The card issuer initiates the contact and at the same time takes application information in person. For example, the following are covered:</p><p class="depth0">1. A consumer applies in person for a car loan at a financial institution and the loan officer invites the consumer to apply for a credit or charge card account; the consumer accepts the invitation and submits an application.</p><p class="depth0">2. An employee of a retail establishment, in the course of processing a sales transaction using a bank credit card, asks a customer if he or she would like to apply for the retailer's credit or charge card; the customer responds affirmatively and submits an application.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This paragraph does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0">A. In-person applications initiated by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Situations where no card will be issued--because, for example, the consumer indicates that he or she does not want the card, or the card issuer decides during the in-person conversation not to issue the card.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.5b--Requirements for Home-equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This section applies to all open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's dwelling, as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(19), and is not limited to plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.3(a), which discusses whether transactions are consumer or business-purpose credit, for guidance on whether a home equity plan is subject to Regulation Z.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes to home equity plans entered into on or after November 7, 1989. Section 226.9(c) applies if, by written agreement under Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home equity plan--entered into on or after November 7, 1989--at or before its scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on different terms. A new plan results, however, if the plan is renewed (with or without changes to the terms) after the scheduled expiration. The new plan is subject to all open-end credit rules, including Sec. Sec. 226.5b, 226.6, and 226.15.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transition rules and renewals of preexistinq plans. The requirements of this section do not apply to home equity plans entered into before November 7, 1989. The requirements of this section also do not apply if the original consumer, on or after November 7, 1989, renews a plan entered into prior to that date (with or without changes to the terms). If, on or after November 7, 1989, a security interest in the consumer's dwelling is added to a line of credit entered into before that date, the substantive restrictions of this section apply

for the remainder of the plan, but no new disclosures are required under this section.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosure of repayment phase--applicability of requirements. Some plans provide in the initial agreement for a period during which no further draws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is made. All of the applicable disclosures in this section must be given for the repayment phase. Thus, for example, a creditor must provide payment information about the repayment phase as well as about the draw period, as required by Sec. 226.5b(d)(5). If the rate that will apply during the repayment phase is fixed at a known amount, the creditor must provide an annual percentage rate under Sec. 226.5b(d)(6) for that phase. If, however, a creditor uses an index to determine the rate that will apply at the time of conversion to the repayment phase--even if the rate will thereafter be fixed--the creditor must provide the information in Sec. 226.5b(d)(12), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payment terms--applicability of closed-end provisions and substantive rules. All payment terms that are provided for in the initial agreement are subject to the requirements of subpart B and not subpart C of the regulation. Payment terms that are subsequently added to the agreement may be subject to subpart B or to subpart C, depending on the circumstances. The following examples apply these general rules to different situations:</p><p class="depth0">If the initial agreement provides for a repayment phase or for other payment terms such as options permitting conversion of part or all of the balance to a fixed rate during the draw period, these terms must be disclosed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 226.5b and 226.6, and not under subpart C. Furthermore, the creditor must continue to provide periodic statements under Sec. 226.7 and comply with other provisions of subpart B (such as the substantive requirements of Sec. 226.5b(f)) throughout the plan, including the repayment phase.</p><p class="depth0">If the consumer and the creditor enter into an agreement during the draw period to repay all or part of the principal balance on different terms (for example, with a fixed rate of interest) and the amount of available credit will be replenished as the principal balance is repaid, the creditor must continue to comply with subpart B. For example, the creditor must continue to provide periodic statements and comply with the substantive requirements of Sec. 226.5b(f) throughout the plan.</p><p class="depth0">If the consumer and creditor enter into an agreement during the draw period to repay all or part of the principal balance and the amount of available credit will not be replenished as the principal balance is repaid, the creditor must give closed-end credit disclosures pursuant to subpart C for that new agreement. In such cases, subpart B, including the substantive rules, does not apply to the closed-end credit transaction, although it will continue to apply to any remaining open-end credit available under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">6. Spreader clause. When a creditor holds a mortgage or deed of trust on the consumer's dwelling and that mortgage or deed of trust contains a spreader clause (also known as a dragnet or cross-collateralization clause), subsequent occurrences such as the opening of an open-end plan are subject to the rules applicable to home equity plans to the same degree as if a security interest were taken directly to secure the plan, unless the creditor effectively waives its security interest under the spreader clause with respect to the subsequent open-end credit extensions.</p><p class="depth0">7. Appraisals and other valuations. For consumer credit transactions subject to Sec. 226.5b and secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, creditors and other persons must comply with the requirements for appraisals and other valuations under Sec. 226.42.</p><p class="depth0">5b(a) Form of Disclosure</p><p class="depth0">5b(a)(1) General</p><p class="depth0">1. Written disclosures. The disclosures required under this section must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, but need not be in a form the consumer can keep. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.6(a)(3) for special rules when disclosures required under Sec. 226.5b(d) are given in a retainable form.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of annual percentage rate--more conspicuous requirement. As provided in Sec. 226.5(a)(2), when the term annual percentage rate is required to be disclosed with a number, it must be more conspicuous than other required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Segregation of disclosures. While most of the disclosures must be grouped together and segregated from all unrelated information, the creditor is permitted to include information that explains or expands on the required disclosures, including, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Any prepayment penalty</p><p class="depth0">How a substitute index may be chosen</p><p class="depth0">Actions the creditor may take short of terminating and accelerating an outstanding balance</p><p class="depth0">Renewal terms</p><p class="depth0">Rebate of fees
An example of information that does not explain or expand on the required disclosures and thus cannot be included is the creditor's underwriting criteria, although the creditor could provide such information separately from the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. Method of providing disclosures. A creditor may provide a single disclosure form for all of its home equity plans, as long as the disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the creditor offers several payment options, all such options must be disclosed. (See, however, the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) (x) and (xi) for disclosure requirements relating to these provisions.) If any aspects of a plan are

linked together, the creditor must disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. For example, if the consumer can only obtain a particular payment option in conjunction with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be disclosed. A creditor has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or variations in features. For example, a creditor that offers different payment options for the draw period may prepare separate disclosure forms for the two payment options. A creditor using this alternative, however, must include a statement on each disclosure form that the consumer should ask about the creditor's other home equity programs. (This disclosure is required only for those programs available generally to the public. Thus, if the only other programs available are employee preferred-rate plans, for example, the creditor would not have to provide this statement.) A creditor that receives a request for information about other available programs must provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth0">5. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures required by this section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying this requirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">i. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.</p><p class="depth0">Whatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5b(a)(2) Precedence of Certain Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Precedence rule. The list of conditions provided at the creditor's option under Sec. 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) need not precede the other disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses a home equity credit line application electronically (other than as described under ii. below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a home equity credit line application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">5b(b) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Mail and telephone applications. If the creditor sends applications through the mail, the disclosures and a brochure must accompany the application. If an application is taken over the telephone, the disclosures and brochure may be delivered or mailed within three business days of taking the application. If an application is mailed to the consumer following a telephone request, however, the creditor also must send the disclosures and a brochure along with the application.</p><p class="depth0">2. General purpose applications. The disclosures and a brochure need not be provided when a general purpose application is given to a consumer unless (1) the application or materials accompanying it indicate that it can be used to apply for a home equity plan or (2) the application is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry about a home equity plan. On the other hand, if a general purpose application is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry only about credit other than a home equity plan, the disclosures and brochure need not be provided even if the application indicates it can be used for a home equity plan, unless it is accompanied by promotional information about home equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">3. Publicly-available applications. Some creditors make applications for home equity plans, such as take-ones, available without the need for a consumer to request them. These applications must be accompanied by the disclosures and a brochure, such as by attaching the disclosures and brochure to the application form.</p><p class="depth0">4. Response cards. A creditor may solicit consumers for its home equity plan by mailing a response card which the consumer returns to the creditor to indicate interest in the plan. If the only action taken by the creditor upon receipt of the response card is to send the consumer an application form or to telephone the consumer to discuss the plan, the creditor need not send the disclosures and brochure with the response card.</p><p class="depth0">5. Denial or withdrawal of application. In situations where footnote 10a permits the creditor a three-day delay in providing disclosures and the brochure, if the creditor determines within that period that an application will not be approved, the creditor need not provide the consumer with the disclosures or brochure. Similarly, if the consumer withdraws the application within this three-day period, the creditor need not provide the disclosures or brochure.</p><p class="depth0">6. Intermediary agent or broker. In determining whether or not an application involves an intermediary agent or broker as discussed in footnote 10a, creditors should consult the provisions in comment 19(b)-3.</p><p class="depth0">5b(c) Duties of Third Parties</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure requirements. Although third parties who give applications to consumers for home equity plans must provide the brochure required under Sec. 226.5b(e) in all cases, such persons need provide the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5b(d) only in certain instances. A third party has no duty to obtain disclosures about a creditor's home equity plan or to create a set of disclosures based on what it knows about a creditor's plan. If, however, a creditor provides the third party with disclosures along with its application form, the third party must give the disclosures to the consumer with the application form. The duties under this section are those of the third party; the creditor is not responsible for ensuring that a third party complies with those obligations. If an intermediary agent or broker takes an application over the telephone or receives an application contained in a magazine or other publication, footnote 10a permits that person to mail the disclosures and brochure within three business days of receipt of the application. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(h) about imposition of nonrefundable fees.)</p><p class="depth0">5b(d) Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures given as applicable. The disclosures required under this section need be made only as applicable. Thus, for example, if negative amortization cannot occur in a home equity plan, a reference to it need not be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Duty to respond to requests for information. If the consumer, prior to the opening of a plan, requests information as suggested in the disclosures (such as the current index value or margin), the creditor must provide this information as soon as reasonably possible after the request.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(1) Retention of Information</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosure not required. The creditor need not disclose that the consumer should make or otherwise retain a copy of the disclosures if they are retainable--for example, if the disclosures are not part of an application that must be returned to the creditor to apply for the plan.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(2) Conditions for Disclosed Terms</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Guaranteed terms. The requirement that the creditor disclose the time by which an application must be submitted to obtain the disclosed terms does not require the creditor to guarantee any terms. If a creditor chooses not to guarantee any terms, it must disclose that all of the terms are subject to change prior to opening the plan. The creditor also is permitted to guarantee some terms and not others, but must indicate which terms are subject to change.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date for obtaining disclosed terms. The creditor may disclose either a specific date or a time period for obtaining the disclosed terms. If the creditor discloses a time period, the consumer must be able to determine from the disclosure the specific date by which an application must be submitted to obtain any guaranteed terms. For example, the disclosure might read, ``To obtain the following terms, you must submit your application within 60 days after the date appearing on this disclosure,'' provided the disclosure form also shows the date.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to other provisions. Creditors should consult the rules in Sec. 226.5b(g) regarding refund of fees.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(4) Possible Actions by Creditor</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(4)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees imposed upon termination. This disclosure applies only to fees (such as penalty or prepayment fees) that the creditor imposes if it terminates the plan prior to normal expiration. The disclosure does not apply to fees that are imposed either when the plan expires in accordance with the agreement or if the consumer terminates the

plan prior to its scheduled maturity. In addition, the disclosure does not apply to fees associated with collection of the debt, such as attorneys fees and court costs, or to increases in the annual percentage rate linked to the consumer's failure to make payments. The actual amount of the fee need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes specified in the initial agreement. If changes may occur pursuant to Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(i), a creditor must state that certain changes will be implemented as specified in the initial agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(4)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of conditions. In making this disclosure, the creditor may provide a highlighted copy of the document that contains such information, such as the contract or security agreement. The relevant items must be distinguished from the other information contained in the document. For example, the creditor may provide a cover sheet that specifically points out which contract provisions contain the information, or may mark the relevant items on the document itself. As an alternative to disclosing the conditions in this manner, the creditor may simply describe the conditions using the language in Sec. Sec. 226.5b(f)(2)(i)-(iii), 226.5b(f)(3)(i) (regarding freezing the line when the maximum annual percentage rate is reached), and 226.5b(f)(3)(vi) or language that is substantially similar. The condition contained in Sec. 226.5b(f)(2)(iv) need not be stated. In describing specified changes that may be implemented during the plan, the creditor may provide a disclosure such as ``Our agreement permits us to make certain changes to the terms of the line at specified times or upon the occurrence of specified events.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosure. The list of conditions under Sec. 226.5b(d)(4)(iii) may appear with the segregated disclosures or apart from them. If the creditor elects to provide the list of conditions with the segregated disclosures, the list need not comply with the precedence rule in Sec. 226.5b(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(5) Payment Terms</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(5)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Length of the plan. The combined length of the draw period and any repayment period need not be stated. If the length of the repayment phase cannot be determined because, for example, it depends on the balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment period, the creditor must state that the length is determined by the size of the balance. If the length of the plan is indefinite (for example, because there is no time limit on the period during which the consumer can take advances), the creditor must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">2. Renewal provisions. If, under the credit agreement, a creditor retains the right to review a line at the end of the specified draw period and determine whether to renew or extend the draw period of the plan, the possibility of renewal or extension--regardless of its likelihood--should be ignored for purposes of the disclosures. For example, if an agreement provides that the draw period is five years and that the creditor may renew the draw period for an additional five years, the possibility of renewal should be ignored and the draw period should be considered five years. (See the commentary accompanying Sec. 226.9(c)(1) dealing with change in terms requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(5)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of the minimum periodic payment. This disclosure must reflect how the minimum periodic payment is determined, but need only describe the principal and interest components of the payment. Other charges that may be part of the payment (as well as the balance computation method) may, but need not, be described under this provision.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fixed rate and term payment options during draw period. If the home equity plan permits the consumer to repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period, this feature must be disclosed. To illustrate, a variable-rate plan may permit a consumer to elect during a ten-year draw period to repay all or a portion of the balance over a three-year period at a fixed rate. The creditor must disclose the rules relating to this feature including the period during which the option can be selected, the length of time over which repayment can occur, any fees imposed for such a feature, and the specific rate or a description of the index and margin that will apply upon exercise of this choice. For example, the index and margin disclosure might state: ``If you choose to convert any portion of your balance to a fixed rate, the rate will be the highest prime rate published in the `Wall Street Journal' that is in effect at the date of conversion plus a margin.'' If the fixed rate is to be determined according to an index, it must be one that is outside the creditor's control and is publicly available in accordance with Sec. 226.5b(f)(1). The effect of exercising the option should not be reflected elsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example required in Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(xi).</p><p class="depth0">3. Balloon payments. In programs where the occurrence of a balloon payment is possible, the creditor must disclose the possibility of a balloon payment even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely. In such cases, the disclosure might read, ``Your minimum payments may not be sufficient to fully repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. If they are not, you will be required to

pay the entire outstanding balance in a single payment.'' In programs where a balloon payment will occur, such as programs with interest-only payments during the draw period and no repayment period, the disclosures must state that fact. For example, the disclosure might read, ``Your minimum payments will not repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. You will be required to pay the entire outstanding balance in a single payment.'' In making this disclosure, the creditor is not required to use the term ``balloon payment.'' The creditor also is not required to disclose the amount of the balloon payment. (See, however, the requirement under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii).) The balloon payment disclosure does not apply in cases where repayment of the entire outstanding balance would occur only as a result of termination and acceleration. The creditor also need not make a disclosure about balloon payments if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(5)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum periodic payment example. In disclosing the payment example, the creditor may assume that the credit limit as well as the outstanding balance is $10,000 if such an assumption is relevant to calculating payments. (If the creditor only offers lines of credit for less than $10,000, the creditor may assume an outstanding balance of $5,000 instead of $10,000 in making this disclosure.) The example should reflect the payment comprised only of principal and interest. Creditors may provide an additional example reflecting other charges that may be included in the payment, such as credit insurance premiums. Creditors may assume that all months have an equal number of days, that payments are collected in whole cents, and that payments will fall on a business day even though they may be due on a non-business day. For variable-rate plans, the example must be based on the last rate in the historical example required in Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(xi), or a more recent rate. In cases where the last rate shown in the historical example is different from the index value and margin (for example, due to a rate cap), creditors should calculate the rate by using the index value and margin. A discounted rate may not be considered a more recent rate in calculating this payment example for either variable- or fixed-rate plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Representative examples. In plans with multiple payment options within the draw period or within any repayment period, the creditor may provide representative examples as an alternative to providing examples for each payment option. The creditor may elect to provide representative payment examples based on three categories of payment options. The first category consists of plans that permit minimum payment of only accrued finance charges (interest only plans). The second category includes plans in which a fixed percentage or a fixed fraction of the outstanding balance or credit limit (for example, 2% of the balance or \1/180\th of the balance) is used to determine the minimum payment. The third category includes all other types of minimum payment options, such as a specified dollar amount plus any accrued finance charges. Creditors may classify their minimum payment arrangements within one of these three categories even if other features exist, such as varying lengths of a draw or repayment period, required payment of past due amounts, late charges, and minimum dollar amounts. The creditor may use a single example within each category to represent the payment options in that category. For example, if a creditor permits minimum payments of 1%, 2%, 3% or 4% of the outstanding balance, it may pick one of these four options and provide the example required under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) for that option alone.</p><p class="depth0">The example used to represent a category must be an option commonly chosen by consumers, or a typical or representative example. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(12) (x) and (xi) for a discussion of the use of representative examples for making those disclosures. Creditors using a representative example within each category must use the same example for purposes of the disclosures under Sec. 226.5b (d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) (x) and (xi).) Creditors may use representative examples under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5) only with respect to the payment example required under paragraph (d)(5)(iii). Creditors must provide a full narrative description of all payment options under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5) (i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples for draw and repayment periods. Separate examples must be given for the draw and repayment periods unless the payments are determined the same way during both periods. In setting forth payment examples for any repayment period under this section (and the historical example under Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(xi)), creditors should assume a $10,000 advance is taken at the beginning of the draw period and is reduced according to the terms of the plan. Creditors should not assume an additional advance is taken at any time, including at the beginning of any repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, in addition to permitting the consumer to obtain advances, may involve the disbursement of monthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment of the reverse mortgage (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be required to be made at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death of the

consumer. In disclosing these plans, creditors must apply the following rules, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0">If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for advances and disbursements but repayment is due only upon occurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements will be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval between disbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment may occur before or after the disbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume that you will repay the line at the time the draw period and our payments to you end. As provided in your agreement, your repayment may be rquired at a different time.'' The single payment should be considered the ``minimum periodic payment'' and consequently would not be treated as a balloon payment. The example of the minimum payment under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) should assume a single $10,000 draw.</p><p class="depth0">If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for advances or disbursements nor a specified repayment date and these terms will be determined solely by reference to future events, including the consumer's death, the creditor may assume that the draws and disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using actuarial tables, for example) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period following the date of the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first. (If terms will be determined by reference to future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base the disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)</p><p class="depth0">In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all draws and disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the consumer. For example, if the note has a non-recourse provision providing that the consumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be drawn or disbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you may be required to pay is limited by your agreement.''</p><p class="depth0">Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property will be shared between the consumer and the creditor. The creditor must disclose the appreciation feature, including describing how the creditor's share will be determined, any limitations, and when the feature may be exercised.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(6) Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Preferred-rate plans. If a creditor offers a preferential fixed-rate plan in which the rate will increase a specified amount upon the occurrence of a specified event, the creditor must disclose the specific amount the rate will increase.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(7) Fees Imposed by Creditor</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The fees referred to in Sec. 226.5b(d)(7) include items such as application fees, points, annual fees, transaction fees, fees to obtain checks to access the plan, and fees imposed for converting to a repayment phase that is provided for in the original agreement. This disclosure includes any fees that are imposed by the creditor to use or maintain the plan, whether the fees are kept by the creditor or a third party. For example, if a creditor requires an annual credit report on the consumer and requires the consumer to pay this fee to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must be specifically stated. Third party fees to open the plan that are initially paid by the consumer to the creditor may be included in this disclosure or in the disclosure under Sec. 226.5b(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">2. Manner of describing fees. Charges may be stated as an estimated dollar amount for each fee, or as a percentage of a typical or representative amount of credit. The creditor may provide a stepped fee schedule in which a fee will increase a specified amount at a specified date. (See the discussion contained in the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Fees not required to be disclosed. Fees that are not imposed to open, use, or maintain a plan, such as fees for researching an account, photocopying, paying late, stopping payment, having a check returned, exceeding the credit limit, or closing out an account do not have to be disclosed under this section. Credit report and appraisal fees imposed to investigate whether a condition permitting a freeze continues to exist--as discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)--are not required to be disclosed under this section or Sec. 226.5b(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebates of closing costs. If closing costs are imposed they must be disclosed, regardless of whether such costs may be rebated later (for example, rebated to the extent of any interest paid during the first year of the plan).</p><p class="depth0">5. Terms used in disclosure. Creditors need not use the terms finance charge or other charge in describing the fees imposed by the

creditor under this section or those imposed by third parties under Sec. 226.5b(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(8) Fees Imposed by Third Parties to Open a Plan</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. Section 226.5b(d)(8) applies only to fees imposed by third parties to open the plan. Thus, for example, this section does not require disclosure of a fee imposed by a government agency at the end of a plan to release a security interest. Fees to be disclosed include appraisal, credit report, government agency, and attorneys fees. In cases where property insurance is required by the creditor, the creditor either may disclose the amount of the premium or may state that property insurance is required. For example, the disclosure might state, ``You must carry insurance on the property that secures this plan.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization of third-party fees. In all cases creditors must state the total of third-party fees as a single dollar amount or a range except that the total need not include costs for property insurance if the creditor discloses that such insurance is required. A creditor has two options with regard to providing the more detailed information about third party fees. Creditors may provide a statement that the consumer may request more specific cost information about third party fees from the creditor. As an alternative to including this statement, creditors may provide an itemization of such fees (by type and amount) with the early disclosures. Any itemization provided upon the consumer's request need not include a disclosure about property insurance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Manner of describing fees. A good faith estimate of the amount of fees must be provided. Creditors may provide, based on a typical or representative amount of credit, a range for such fees or state the dollar amount of such fees. Fees may be expressed on a unit cost basis, for example, $5 per $1,000 of credit.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebates of third party fees. Even if fees imposed by third parties may be rebated, they must be disclosed. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(7).)</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(9) Negative Amortization</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In transactions where the minimum payment will not or may not be sufficient to cover the interest that accrues on the outstanding balance, the creditor must disclose that negative amortization will or may occur. This disclosure is required whether or not the unpaid interest is added to the outstanding balance upon which interest is computed. A disclosure is not required merely because a loan calls for non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(10) Transaction Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. A limitation on automated teller machine usage need not be disclosed under this paragraph unless that is the only means by which the consumer can obtain funds.</p><p class="depth0">5b(d)(12) Disclosures for Variable-Rate Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate provisions. Sample forms in appendix G-14 provide illustrative guidance on the variable-rate rules.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of annual percentage rate. If the creditor adjusts its index through the addition of a margin, the disclosure might read, ``Your annual percentage rate is based on the index plus a margin.'' The creditor is not required to disclose a specific value for the margin.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(viii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Preferred-rate provisions. This paragraph requires disclosure of preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Provisions on conversion to fixed rates. The commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(ii) discusses the disclosure requirements for options permitting the consumer to convert from a variable rate to a fixed rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(ix)</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic limitations on increases in rates. The creditor must disclose any annual limitations on increases in the annual percentage rate. If the creditor bases its rate limitation on 12 monthly billing cycles, such a limitation should be treated as an annual cap. Rate limitations imposed on less than an annual basis must be stated in terms of a specific amount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate limitations on only a semiannual basis, this must be expressed as a rate limitation for a six-month time period. If the creditor does not impose periodic limitations (annual or shorter) on rate increases, the fact that there are no annual rate limitations must be stated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Maximum limitations on increases in rates. The maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed under each payment option over the term of the plan (including the draw period and any repayment period provided for in the initial agreement) must be provided. The creditor may disclose this rate as a specific number (for example, 18%) or as a specific amount above the initial rate. For example, this disclosure might read, ``The maximum annual percentage rate that can apply to your line will be 5 percentage points above your initial rate.'' If the creditor

states the maximum rate as a specific amount above the initial rate, the creditor must include a statement that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available. If an initial discount is not taken into account in applying maximum rate limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate overall limitations apply to rate increases resulting from events such as the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations also must be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of disclosures. The creditor need not disclose each periodic or maximum rate limitation that is currently available. Instead, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and maximum rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's home equity plans. Creditors using this alternative must include a statement that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(x)</p><p class="depth0">1. Maximum rate payment example. In calculating the payment creditors should assume the maximum rate is in effect. Any discounted or premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations should be ignored for purposes of this disclosure. If a range is used to disclose the maximum cap under Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), the highest rate in the range must be used for the disclosure under this paragraph. As an alternative to making disclosures based on each payment option, the creditor may choose a representative example within the three categories of payment options upon which to base this disclosure. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5).) However, separate examples must be provided for the draw period and for any repayment period unless the payment is determined the same way in both periods. Creditors should calculate the example for the repayment period based on an assumed $10,000 balance. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Time the maximum rate could be reached. In stating the date or time when the maximum rate could be reached, creditors should assume the rate increases as rapidly as possible under the plan. In calculating the date or time, creditors should factor in any discounted or premium initial rates and periodic rate limitations. This disclosure must be provided for the draw phase and any repayment phase. Creditors should assume the index and margin shown in the last year of the historical example (or a more recent rate) is in effect at the beginning of each phase.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(d)(12)(xi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Index movement. Index values and annual percentage rates must be shown for the entire 15 years of the historical example and must be based on the most recent 15 years. The example must be updated annually to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values as soon as reasonably possible after the new index value becomes available. If the values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far as the values have been available and may start the historical example at the year for which values are first available.</p><p class="depth0">2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect the method of choosing index values for the plan. For example, if an average of index values is used in the plan, averages must be used in the example, but if an index value as of a particular date is used, a single index value must be shown. The creditor is required to assume one date (or one period, if an average is used) within a year on which to base the history of index values. The creditor may choose to use index values as of any date or period as long as the index value as of this date or period is used for each year in the example. Only one index value per year need be shown, even if the plan provides for adjustments to the annual percentage rate or payment more than once in a year. In such cases, the creditor can assume that the index rate remained constant for the full year for the purpose of calculating the annual percentage rate and payment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Selection of margin. A value for the margin must be assumed in order to prepare the example. A creditor may select a representative margin that it has used with the index during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures and state that the margin is one that it has used recently. The margin selected may be used until the creditor annually updates the disclosure form to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amount of discount or premium. In reflecting any discounted or premium initial rate, the creditor may select a discount or premium that it has used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used recently. The discount or premium should be reflected in the example for as long as it is in effect. The creditor may assume that a discount or premium that would have been in effect for any part of a year was in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the historical example.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rate limitations. Limitations on both periodic and maximum rates must be reflected in the historical example. If ranges of rate limitations are provided under

Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(ix), the highest rates provided in those ranges must be used in the example. Rate limitations that may apply more often than annually should be treated as if they were annual limitations. For example, if a creditor imposes a 1% cap every six months, this should be reflected in the example as if it were a 2% annual cap.</p><p class="depth0">6. Assumed advances. The creditor should assume that the $10,000 balance is an advance taken at the beginning of the first billing cycle and is reduced according to the terms of the plan, and that the consumer takes no subsequent draws. As discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5), creditors should not assume an additional advance is taken at the beginning of any repayment period. If applicable, the creditor may assume the $10,000 is both the advance and the credit limit. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)</p><p class="depth0">7. Representative payment options. The creditor need not provide an historical example for all of its various payment options, but may select a representative payment option within each of the three categories of payments upon which to base its disclosure. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5).)</p><p class="depth0">8. Payment information. The payment figures in the historical example must reflect all significant program terms. For example, features such as rate and payment caps, a discounted initial rate, negative amortization, and rate carryover must be taken into account in calculating the payment figures if these would have applied to the plan. The historical example should include payments for as much of the length of the plan as would occur during a 15-year period. For example:</p><p class="depth0">If the draw period is 10 years and the repayment period is 15 years, the example should illustrate the entire 10-year draw period and the first 5 years of the repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">If the length of the draw period is 15 years and there is a 15-year repayment phase, the historical example must reflect the payments for the 15-year draw period and would not show any of the repayment period. No additional historical example would be required to reflect payments for the repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">If the length of the plan is less than 15 years, payments in the historical example need only be shown for the number of years in the term. In such cases, however, the creditor must show the index values, margin and annual percentage rates and continue to reflect all significant plan terms such as rate limitations for the entire 15 years.
A creditor need show only a single payment per year in the example, even though payments may vary during a year. The calculations should be based on the actual payment computation formula, although the creditor may assume that all months have an equal number of days. The creditor may assume that payments are made on the last day of the billing cycle, the billing date or the payment due date, but must be consistent in the manner in which the period used to illustrate payment information is selected. Information about balloon payments and remaining balance may, but need not, be reflected in the example.</p><p class="depth0">9. Disclosures for repayment period. The historical example must reflect all features of the repayment period, including the appropriate index values, margin, rate limitations, length of the repayment period, and payments. For example, if different indices are used during the draw and repayment periods, the index values for that portion of the 15 years that reflect the repayment period must be the values for the appropriate index.</p><p class="depth0">10. Reverse mortgages. The historical example for reverse mortgages should reflect 15 years of index values and annual percentage rates, but the payment column should be blank until the year that the single payment will be made, assuming that payment is estimated to occur within 15 years. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5) for a discussion of reverse mortgages.)</p><p class="depth0">5b(e) Brochure</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitutes. A brochure is a suitable substitute for the Board's home equity brochure if it is, at a minimum, comparable to the Board's brochure in substance and comprehensiveness. Creditors are permitted to provide more detailed information than is contained in the Board's brochure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Effect of third party delivery of brochure. If a creditor determines that a third party has provided a consumer with the required brochure pursuant to Sec. 226.5b(c), the creditor need not give the consumer a second brochure.</p><p class="depth0">5b(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 226.5b(f) limits both actions that may be taken and language that may be included in contracts, and applies to any assignee or holder as well as to the original creditor. The limitations apply to the draw period and any repayment period, and to any renewal or modification of the original agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. External index. A creditor may change the annual percentage rate for a plan only if the change is based on an index outside the creditor's control. Thus, a creditor may not make rate changes based on its own prime rate or cost of funds and may not reserve a contractual right to change rates at its discretion. A creditor is permitted, however, to use a published prime rate, such as that in the Wall Street Journal, even if the bank's

own prime rate is one of several rates used to establish the published rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Publicly available. The index must be available to the public. A publicly available index need not be published in a newspaper, but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone, for example) and use to verify rates imposed under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Provisions not prohibited. This paragraph does not prohibit rate changes that are specifically set forth in the agreement. For example, stepped-rate plans, in which specified rates are imposed for specified periods, are permissible. In addition, preferred-rate provisions, in which the rate increases by a specified amount upon the occurrence of a specified event, also are permissible.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitations on termination and acceleration. In general, creditors are prohibited from terminating and accelerating payment of the outstanding balance before the scheduled expiration of a plan. However, creditors may take these actions in the four circumstances specified in Sec. 226.5b(f)(2). Creditors are not permitted to specify in their contracts any other events that allow termination and acceleration beyond those permitted by the regulation. Thus, for example, an agreement may not provide that the balance is payable on demand nor may it provide that the account will be terminated and the balance accelerated if the rate cap is reached.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other actions permitted. If an event permitting termination and acceleration occurs, a creditor may instead take actions short of terminating and accelerating. For example, a creditor could temporarily or permanently suspend further advances, reduce the credit limit, change the payment terms, or require the consumer to pay a fee. A creditor also may provide in its agreement that a higher rate or higher fees will apply in circumstances under which it would otherwise be permitted to terminate the plan and accelerate the balance. A creditor that does not immediately terminate an account and accelerate payment or take another permitted action may take such action at a later time, provided one of the conditions permitting termination and acceleration exists at that time.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fraud or material misrepresentation. A creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance if there has been fraud or material misrepresentation by the consumer in connection with the plan. This exception includes fraud or misrepresentation at any time, either during the application process or during the draw period and any repayment period. What constitutes fraud or misrepresentation is determined by applicable state law and may include acts of omission as well as overt acts, as long as any necessary intent on the part of the consumer exists.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to meet repayment terms. A creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance when the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms provided for in the agreement. However, a creditor may terminate and accelerate under this provision only if the consumer actually fails to make payments. For example, a creditor may not terminate and accelerate if the consumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a branch rather than the main office of the creditor. If a consumer files for or is placed in bankruptcy, the creditor may terminate and accelerate under this provision if the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement. This section does not override any state or other law that requires a right-to-cure notice, or otherwise places a duty on the creditor before it can terminate a plan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Impairment of security. A creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance if the consumer's action or inaction adversely affects the creditor's security for the plan, or any right of the creditor in that security. Action or inaction by third parties does not, in itself, permit the creditor to terminate and accelerate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. A creditor may terminate and accelerate, for example, if:</p><p class="depth0">The consumer transfers title to the property or sells the property without the permission of the creditor</p><p class="depth0">The consumer fails to maintain required insurance on the dwelling</p><p class="depth0">The consumer fails to pay taxes on the property</p><p class="depth0">The consumer permits the filing of a lien senior to that held by the creditor</p><p class="depth0">The sole consumer obligated on the plan dies</p><p class="depth0">The property is taken through eminent domain</p><p class="depth0">A prior lienholder forecloses
By contrast, the filing of a judgment against the consumer would permit termination and acceleration only if the amount of the judgment and collateral subject to the judgment is such that the creditor's security is adversely affected. If the consumer commits waste or otherwise destructively uses or fails to maintain the property such that the action adversely affects the security, the plan may be terminated and the balance accelerated. Illegal use of the property by the consumer would permit termination and acceleration if it subjects the property to seizure.

If one of two consumers obligated on a plan dies the creditor may terminate the plan and accelerate the balance if the security is adversely affected. If the consumer moves out of the dwelling that secures the plan and that action adversely affects the security, the creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of provision. In general, a creditor may not change the terms of a plan after it is opened. For example, a creditor may not increase any fee or impose a new fee once the plan has been opened, even if the fee is charged by a third party, such as a credit reporting agency, for a service. The change of terms prohibition applies to all features of a plan, not only those required to be disclosed under this section. For example, this provision applies to charges imposed for late payment, although this fee is not required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.5b(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges not covered. There are three charges not covered by this provision. A creditor may pass on increases in taxes since such charges are imposed by a governmental body and are beyond the control of the creditor. In addition, a creditor may pass on increases in premiums for property insurance that are excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(d)(2), since such insurance provides a benefit to the consumer independent of the use of the line and is often maintained notwithstanding the line. A creditor also may pass on increases in premiums for credit insurance that are excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(d)(1), since the insurance is voluntary and provides a benefit to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes provided for in agreement. A creditor may provide in the initial agreement that further advances will be prohibited or the credit line reduced during any period in which the maximum annual percentage rate is reached. A creditor also may provide for other specific changes to take place upon the occurrence of specific events. Both the triggering event and the resulting modification must be stated with specificity. For example, in home equity plans for employees, the agreement could provide that a specified higher rate or margin will apply if the borrower's employment with the creditor ends. A contract could contain a stepped-rate or stepped-fee schedule providing for specified changes in the rate or the fees on certain dates or after a specified period of time. A creditor also may provide in the initial agreement that it will be entitled to a share of the appreciation in the value of the property as long as the specific appreciation share and the specific circumstances which require the payment of it are set forth. A contract may permit a consumer to switch among minimum payment options during the plan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited provisions. A creditor may not include a general provision in its agreement permitting changes to any or all of the terms of the plan. For example, creditors may not include ``boilerplate'' language in the agreement stating that they reserve the right to change the fees imposed under the plan. In addition, a creditor may not include any ``triggering events'' or responses that the regulation expressly addresses in a manner different from that provided in the regulation. For example, an agreement may not provide that the margin in a variable-rate plan will increase if there is a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances, because the regulation specifies that temporarily freezing the line or lowering the credit limit is the permissible response to a material change in the consumer's financial circumstances. Similarly a contract cannot contain a provision allowing the creditor to freeze a line due to an insignificant decline in property value since the regulation allows that response only for a significant decline.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitution of index. A creditor may change the index and margin used under the plan if the original index becomes unavailable, as long as historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices were substantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and margin will produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the time the original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newly established and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be used if it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect when the original index became unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes by written agreement. A creditor may change the terms of a plan if the consumer expressly agrees in writing to the change at the time it is made. For example, a consumer and a creditor could agree in writing to change the repayment terms from interest-only payments to payments that reduce the principal balance. The provisions of any such agreement are governed by the limitations in Sec. 226.5b(f). For example, a mutual agreement could not provide for future annual percentage rate changes based on the movement of an index controlled by the creditor or for termination and acceleration under circumstances other than those specified in the regulation. By contrast, a consumer could agree to a new credit limit for the plan, although the agreement could not

permit the creditor to later change the credit limit except by a subsequent written agreement or in the circumstances described in Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">2. Written agreement. The change must be agreed to in writing by the consumer. Creditors are not permitted to assume consent because the consumer uses an account, even if use of an account would otherwise constitute acceptance of a proposed change under state law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Beneficial changes. After a plan is opened, a creditor may make changes that unequivocally benefit the consumer. Under this provision, a creditor may offer more options to consumers, as long as existing options remain. For example, a creditor may offer the consumer the option of making lower monthly payments or could increase the credit limit. Similarly, a creditor wishing to extend the length of the plan on the same terms may do so. Creditors are permitted to temporarily reduce the rate or fees charged during the plan (though a change in terms notice may be required under Sec. 226.9(c) when the rate or fees are returned to their original level). Creditors also may offer an additional means of access to the line, even if fees are associated with using the device, provided the consumer retains the ability to use prior access devices on the original terms.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(v)</p><p class="depth0">1. Insignificant changes. A creditor is permitted to make insignificant changes after a plan is opened. This rule accommodates operational and similar problems, such as changing the address of the creditor for purposes of sending payments. It does not permit a creditor to change a term such as a fee charged for late payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of insignificant changes. Creditors may make minor changes to features such as the billing cycle date, the payment due date (as long as the consumer does not have a diminished grace period if one is provided), and the day of the month on which index values are measured to determine changes to the rate for variable-rate plans. A creditor also may change its rounding practice in accordance with the tolerance rules set forth in Sec. 226.14 (for example, stating an exact APR of 14.3333 percent as 14.3 percent, even if it had previously been stated as 14.33 percent). A creditor may change the balance computation method it uses only if the change produces an insignificant difference in the finance charge paid by the consumer. For example, a creditor may switch from using the average daily balance method (including new transactions) to the daily balance method (including new transactions).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5b(f)(3)(vi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Suspension of credit privileges or reduction of credit limit. A creditor may prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit in the circumstances specified in this section of the regulation. In addition, as discussed under Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(i), a creditor may contractually reserve the right to take such actions when the maximum annual percentage rate is reached. A creditor may not take these actions under other circumstances, unless the creditor would be permitted to terminate the line and accelerate the balance as described in Sec. 226.5b(f)(2). The creditor's right to reduce the credit limit does not permit reducing the limit below the amount of the outstanding balance if this would require the consumer to make a higher payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Temporary nature of suspension or reduction. Creditors are permitted to prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the credit limit only while one of the designated circumstances exists. When the circumstance justifying the creditor's action ceases to exist, credit privileges must be reinstated, assuming that no other circumstance permitting such action exists at that time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Imposition of fees. If not prohibited by state law, a creditor may collect only bona fide and reasonable appraisal and credit report fees if such fees are actually incurred in investigating whether the condition permitting the freeze continues to exist. A creditor may not, in any circumstances, impose a fee to reinstate a credit line once the condition has been determined not to exist.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reinstatement of credit privileges. Creditors are responsible for ensuring that credit privileges are restored as soon as reasonably possible after the condition that permitted the creditor's action ceases to exist. One way a creditor can meet this responsibility is to monitor the line on an ongoing basis to determine when the condition ceases to exist. The creditor must investigate the condition frequently enough to assure itself that the condition permitting the freeze continues to exist. The frequency with which the creditor must investigate to determine whether a condition continues to exist depends upon the specific condition permitting the freeze. As an alternative to such monitoring, the creditor may shift the duty to the consumer to request reinstatement of credit privileges by providing a notice in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(iii). A creditor may require a reinstatement request to be in writing if it notifies the consumer of this requirement on the notice provided under Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(iii). Once the consumer requests reinstatement, the creditor must promptly investigate to determine whether the condition allowing

the freeze continues to exist. Under this alternative, the creditor has a duty to investigate only upon the consumer's request.</p><p class="depth0">5. Suspension of credit privileges following request by consumer. A creditor may honor a specific request by a consumer to suspend credit privileges. If the consumer later requests that the creditor reinstate credit privileges, the creditor must do so provided no other circumstance justifying a suspension exists at that time. If two or more consumers are obligated under a plan and each has the ability to take advances, the agreement may permit any of the consumers to direct the creditor not to make further advances. A creditor may require that all persons obligated under a plan request reinstatement.</p><p class="depth0">6. Significant decline defined. What constitutes a significant decline for purposes of Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) will vary according to individual circumstances. In any event, if the value of the dwelling declines such that the initial difference between the credit limit and the available equity (based on the property's appraised value for purposes of the plan) is reduced by fifty percent, this constitutes a significant decline in the value of the dwelling for purposes of Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A). For example, assume that a house with a first mortgage of $50,000 is appraised at $100,000 and the credit limit is $30,000. The difference between the credit limit and the available equity is $20,000, half of which is $10,000. The creditor could prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit if the value of the property declines from $100,000 to $90,000. This provision does not require a creditor to obtain an appraisal before suspending credit privileges although a significant decline must occur before suspension can occur.</p><p class="depth0">7. Material change in financial circumstances. Two conditions must be met for Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(B) to apply. First, there must be a ``material change'' in the consumer's financial circumstances, such as a significant decrease in the consumer's income. Second, as a result of this change, the creditor must have a reasonable belief that the consumer will be unable to fulfill the payment obligations of the plan. A creditor may, but does not have to, rely on specific evidence (such as the failure to pay other debts) in concluding that the second part of the test has been met. A creditor may prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit under this section if a consumer files for or is placed in bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0">8. Default of a material obligation. Creditors may specify events that would qualify as a default of a material obligation under Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(C). For example, a creditor may provide that default of a material obligation will exist if the consumer moves out of the dwelling or permits an intervening lien to be filed that would take priority over future advances made by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">9. Government limits on the annual percentage rate. Under Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(D), a creditor may prohibit further advances or reduce the credit limit if, for example, a state usury law is enacted which prohibits a creditor from imposing the agreed-upon annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">5b(g) Refund of Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Refund of fees required. If any disclosed term, including any term provided upon request pursuant to Sec. 226.5b(d), changes between the time the early disclosures are provided to the consumer and the time the plan is opened, and the consumer as a result decides to not enter into the plan, a creditor must refund all fees paid by the consumer in connection with the application. All fees, including credit report fees and appraisal fees, must be refunded whether such fees are paid to the creditor or directly to third parties. A consumer is entitled to a refund of fees under these circumstances whether or not terms are guaranteed by the creditor under Sec. 226.5b(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate plans. The right to a refund of fees does not apply to changes in the annual percentage rate resulting from fluctuations in the index value in a variable-rate plan. Also, if the maximum annual percentage rate is expressed as an amount over the initial rate, the right to refund of fees would not apply to changes in the cap resulting from fluctuations in the index value.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes in terms. If a term, such as the maximum rate, is stated as a range in the early disclosures, and the term ultimately applicable to the plan falls within that range, a change does not occur for purposes of this section. If, however, no range is used and the term is changed (for example, a rate cap of 6 rather than 5 percentage points over the initial rate), the change would permit the consumer to obtain a refund of fees. If a fee imposed by the creditor is stated in the early disclosures as an estimate and the fee changes, the consumer could elect to not enter into the agreement and would be entitled to a refund of fees. On the other hand, if fees imposed by third parties are disclosed as estimates and those fees change, the consumer is not entitled to a refund of fees paid in connection with the application. Creditors must, however, use the best information reasonably available in providing disclosures about such fees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Timing of refunds and relation to other provisions. The refund of fees must be made as soon as reasonably possible after the creditor is notified that the consumer is not entering into the plan because of the changed term, or that the consumer wants a refund of fees.

The fact that an application fee may be refunded to some applicants under this provision does not render such fees finance charges under Sec. 226.4(c)(1) of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">5b(h) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Collection of fees after consumer receives disclosures. A fee may be collected after the consumer receives the disclosures and brochure and before the expiration of three days, although the fee must be refunded if, within three days of receiving the required information, the consumer decides to not enter into the agreement. In such a case, the consumer must be notified that the fee is refundable for three days. The notice must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, and may be included with the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5b(d) or as an attachment to them. If disclosures and brochure are mailed to the consumer, footnote 10d of the regulation provides that a nonrefundable fee may not be imposed until six business days after the mailing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Collection of fees before consumer receives disclosures. An application fee may be collected before the consumer receives the disclosures and brochure (for example, when an application contained in a magazine is mailed in with an application fee) provided that it remains refundable until three business days after the consumer receives the Sec. 226.5b disclosures. No other fees except a refundable membership fee may be collected until after the consumer receives the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5b.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relation to other provisions. A fee collected before disclosures are provided may become nonrefundable except that, under Sec. 226.5b(g), it must be refunded if the consumer elects to not enter into the plan because of a change in terms. (Of course, all fees must be refunded if the consumer later rescinds under Sec. 226.15.)</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.6--Account-Opening Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">6(a) Rules affecting home-equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(1) Finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. When finance charges accrue. Creditors are not required to disclose a specific date when finance charges will begin to accrue. Creditors may provide a general explanation such as that the consumer has 30 days from the closing date to pay the new balance before finance charges will accrue on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Grace periods. In disclosing whether or not a grace period exists, the creditor need not use ``free period,'' ``free-ride period,'' ``grace period'' or any other particular descriptive phrase or term. For example, a statement that ``the finance charge begins on the date the transaction is posted to your account'' adequately discloses that no grace period exists. In the same fashion, a statement that ``finance charges will be imposed on any new purchases only if they are not paid in full within 25 days after the close of the billing cycle'' indicates that a grace period exists in the interim.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Range of balances. The range of balances disclosure is inapplicable:</p><p class="depth0">i. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire account balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire balance for a feature (for example, cash advances), even though the balance for another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a 1.5% monthly periodic rate on purchase balances of $0-$500, and a 1% monthly periodic rate for balances above $500). In this example, the creditor must give a range of balances disclosure for the purchase feature.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate disclosures--coverage.</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples. This section covers open-end credit plans under which rate changes are specifically set forth in the account agreement and are tied to an index or formula. A creditor would use variable-rate disclosures for plans involving rate changes such as the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are tied to the rate the creditor pays on its six-month certificates of deposit.</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates.</p><p class="depth0">C. Rate changes that are tied to changes in the creditor's commercial lending rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An open-end credit plan in which the employee receives a lower rate contingent upon employment (that is, with the rate to be increased upon termination of employment) is not a variable-rate plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate plan--rate(s) in effect. In disclosing the rate(s) in effect at the time of the account-opening disclosures (as is required by Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii)), the creditor may use an insert showing the current rate; may give the rate as of a specified date and then update the disclosure from time to time, for example, each calendar month; or may disclose an estimated rate under Sec. 226.5(c).</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable-rate plan--additional disclosures required. In addition to disclosing the rates in effect at the time of the account-opening disclosures, the disclosures under Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) also must be made.</p><p class="depth0">5. Variable-rate plan--index. The index to be used must be clearly identified; the creditor need not give, however, an explanation of how the index is determined or provide instructions for obtaining it.</p><p class="depth0">6. Variable-rate plan--circumstances for increase.</p><p class="depth0">i. Circumstances under which the rate(s) may increase include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. An increase in the Treasury bill rate.</p><p class="depth0">B. An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor must disclose when the increase will take effect; for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``An increase will take effect on the day that the Treasury bill rate increases,'' or</p><p class="depth0">B. ``An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate will take effect on the first day of the creditor's billing cycle.''</p><p class="depth0">7. Variable-rate plan--limitations on increase. In disclosing any limitations on rate increases, limitations such as the maximum increase per year or the maximum increase over the duration of the plan must be disclosed. When there are no limitations, the creditor may, but need not, disclose that fact. (A maximum interest rate must be included in dwelling-secured open-end credit plans under which the interest rate may be changed. See Sec. 226.30 and the commentary to that section.) Legal limits such as usury or rate ceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations need not be disclosed. Examples of limitations that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. ``The rate on the plan will not exceed 25% annual percentage rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``Not more than \1/2\% increase in the annual percentage rate per year will occur.''</p><p class="depth0">8. Variable-rate plan--effects of increase. Examples of effects of rate increases that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any requirement for additional collateral if the annual percentage rate increases beyond a specified rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any increase in the scheduled minimum periodic payment amount.</p><p class="depth0">9. Variable-rate plan--change-in-terms notice not required. No notice of a change in terms is required for a rate increase under a variable-rate plan as defined in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-2.</p><p class="depth0">10. Discounted variable-rate plans. In some variable-rate plans, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent margin. If the current Treasury bill rate is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 percent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent, or the creditor may disregard the index or formula and set the initial rate at 9 percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When creditors use an initial rate that is not calculated using the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the account-opening disclosure statement should reflect:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial rate (expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual percentage rate), together with a statement of how long the initial rate will remain in effect;</p><p class="depth0">B. The current rate that would have been applied using the index or formula (also expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual percentage rate); and</p><p class="depth0">C. The other variable-rate information required in Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">iii. In disclosing the current periodic and annual percentage rates that would be applied using the index or formula, the creditor may use any of the disclosure options described in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-3.</p><p class="depth0">11. Increased penalty rates. If the initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or more specific events, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the creditor must disclose the initial rate and the increased penalty rate that may apply. If the penalty rate is based on an index and an increased margin, the issuer must disclose the index and the margin. The creditor must also disclose the specific event or events that may result in the increased rate, such as ``22% APR, if 60 days late.'' If the penalty rate cannot be determined at the time disclosures are given, the creditor must provide an explanation of the specific event or events that may result in the increased rate. At the creditor's option, the creditor may disclose the period for which the increased rate will remain in effect, such as ``until you make three timely payments.'' The creditor need not disclose an increased rate that is imposed when credit privileges are permanently terminated.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Explanation of balance computation method. A shorthand phrase such as ``previous balance method'' does not suffice in explaining the balance computation method. (See Model Clauses G-1 and G-1(A) to part 226.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how payments and other credits are allocated to outstanding balances. For example, the creditor need not disclose that payments are applied to late charges, overdue balances, and finance charges before being applied to the principal balance; or in a multifeatured plan, that payments are applied first to finance charges, then to purchases, and then to cash advances. (See comment 7-1 for definition of multifeatured plan.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Finance charges. In addition to disclosing the periodic rate(s) under Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii), creditors must disclose any other type of finance charge that may be imposed, such as minimum, fixed, transaction, and activity charges; required insurance; or appraisal or credit report fees (unless excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(7)). Creditors are not required to disclose the fact that no finance charge is imposed when the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount or the balance below which no finance charge will be imposed.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(2) Other charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. General; examples of other charges. Under Sec. 226.6(a)(2), significant charges related to the

plan (that are not finance charges) must also be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Late-payment and over-the-credit-limit charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees for providing documentary evidence of transactions requested under Sec. 226.13 (billing error resolution).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Charges imposed in connection with residential mortgage transactions or real estate transactions such as title, appraisal, and credit-report fees (see Sec. 226.4(c)(7)).</p><p class="depth0">iv. A tax imposed on the credit transaction by a state or other governmental body, such as a documentary stamp tax on cash advances. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.4(a)).</p><p class="depth0">v. A membership or participation fee for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, unless the fee is required whether or not the open-end credit feature is included. For example, a membership fee to join a credit union is not an ``other charge,'' even if membership is required to apply for credit. For example, if the primary benefit of membership in an organization is the opportunity to apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature, the membership fee would be disclosed as an ``other charge.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Charges imposed for the termination of an open-end credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The following are examples of charges that are not ``other charges''</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees charged for documentary evidence of transactions for income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Amounts payable by a consumer for collection activity after default; attorney's fees, whether or not automatically imposed; foreclosure costs; post-judgment interest rates imposed by law; and reinstatement or reissuance fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Premiums for voluntary credit life or disability insurance, or for property insurance, that are not part of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Application fees under Sec. 226.4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">v. A monthly service charge for a checking account with overdraft protection that is applied to all checking accounts, whether or not a credit feature is attached.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Charges for submitting as payment a check that is later returned unpaid (See commentary to Sec. 226.4(c)(2)).</p><p class="depth0">vii. Charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system. (See also comment 7(a)(2)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">viii. Taxes and filing or notary fees excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(e).</p><p class="depth0">ix. A fee to expedite delivery of a credit card, either at account opening or during the life of the account, provided delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service (or other means at least as fast) without paying a fee for delivery.</p><p class="depth0">x. A fee charged for arranging a single payment on the credit account, upon the consumer's request (regardless of how frequently the consumer requests the service), if the credit plan provides that the consumer may make payments on the account by another reasonable means, such as by standard mail service, without paying a fee to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(3) Home-equity plan information.</p><p class="depth0">1. Additional disclosures required. For home-equity plans, creditors must provide several of the disclosures set forth in Sec. 226.5b(d) along with the disclosures required under Sec. 226.6. Creditors also must disclose a list of the conditions that permit the creditor to terminate the plan, freeze or reduce the credit limit, and implement specified modifications to the original terms. (See comment 5b(d)(4)(iii)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosures. The home-equity disclosures provided under this section must be in a form the consumer can keep, and are governed by Sec. 226.5(a)(1). The segregation standard set forth in Sec. 226.5b(a) does not apply to home-equity disclosures provided under Sec. 226.6.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of payment and variable-rate examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. The payment-example disclosure in Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and the variable-rate information in Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi), and (d)(12)(xii) need not be provided with the disclosures under Sec. 226.6 if the disclosures under Sec. 226.5b(d) were provided in a form the consumer could keep; and the disclosures of the payment example under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), the maximum-payment example under Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and the historical table under Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(xi) included a representative payment example for the category of payment options the consumer has chosen.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, if a creditor offers three payment options (one for each of the categories described in the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)), describes all three options in its early disclosures, and provides all of the disclosures in a retainable form, that creditor need not provide the Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) or (d)(12) disclosures again when the account is opened. If the creditor showed only one of the three options in the early disclosures (which would be the case with a separate disclosure form rather than a combined form, as discussed under Sec. 226.5b(a)), the disclosures under Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi) and (d)(12)(xii) must be given to any consumer who chooses one of the other two options. If the Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) disclosures are provided with the second set of disclosures, they need not be transaction-specific, but may be based on a representative example of the category of payment option chosen.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosures for the repayment period. The creditor must provide disclosures about both

the draw and repayment phases when giving the disclosures under Sec. 226.6. Specifically, the creditor must make the disclosures in Sec. 226.6(a)(3), state the corresponding annual percentage rate, and provide the variable-rate information required in Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) for the repayment phase. To the extent the corresponding annual percentage rate, the information in Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii), and any other required disclosures are the same for the draw and repayment phase, the creditor need not repeat such information, as long as it is clear that the information applies to both phases.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(4) Security interests.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors are not required to use specific terms to describe a security interest, or to explain the type of security or the creditor's rights with respect to the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification of property. Creditors sufficiently identify collateral by type by stating, for example, motor vehicle or household appliances. (Creditors should be aware, however, that the federal credit practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit certain security interests in household goods.) The creditor may, at its option, provide a more specific identification (for example, a model and serial number.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. If collateral for preexisting credit with the creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor must disclose that fact. (Such security interests may be known as ``spreader'' or ``dragnet'' clauses, or as ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) The creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan'' is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Additional collateral. If collateral is required when advances reach a certain amount, the creditor should disclose the information available at the time of the account-opening disclosures. For example, if the creditor knows that a security interest will be taken in household goods if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, the creditor should disclose accordingly. If the creditor knows that security will be required if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, but the creditor does not know what security will be required, the creditor must disclose on the initial disclosure statement that security will be required if the balance exceeds $1,000, and the creditor must provide a change-in-terms notice under Sec. 226.9(c) at the time the security is taken. (See comment 6(a)(4)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Collateral from third party. Security interests taken in connection with the plan must be disclosed, whether the collateral is owned by the consumer or a third party.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(5) Statement of billing rights.</p><p class="depth0">1. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3, G-3(A), G-4, and G-4(A).</p><p class="depth0">6(b) Rules affecting open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(1) Form of disclosures; tabular format for open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to tabular summary for applications and solicitations. See commentary to Sec. 226.5a(a), (b), and (c) regarding format and content requirements, except for the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors must use the accuracy standard for annual percentage rates in Sec. 226.6(b)(4)(ii)(G).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Generally, creditors must disclose the specific rate for each feature that applies to the account. If the rates on an open-end (not home-secured) plan vary by state and the creditor is providing the account-opening table in person at the time the plan is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services the creditor may, at its option, disclose in the account-opening table (A) the rate applicable to the consumer's account, or (B) the range of rates, if the disclosure includes a statement that the rate varies by state and refers the consumer to the account agreement or other disclosure provided with the account-opening table where the rate applicable to the consumer's account is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditors must explain whether or not a grace period exists for all features on the account. The row heading ``Paying Interest'' must be used if any one feature on the account does not have a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Creditors must name the balance computation method used for each feature of the account and state that an explanation of the balance computation method(s) is provided in the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">v. Creditors must state that consumers' billing rights are provided in the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">vi. If fees on an open-end (not home-secured) plan vary by state and the creditor is providing the account-opening table in person at the time the plan is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services the creditor may, at its option, disclose in the account-opening table (A) the specific fee applicable to the consumer's account, or (B) the range of fees, if the disclosure includes a statement that the amount of the fee varies by state and refers the consumer to the account agreement or other disclosure provided with the account-opening table where the fee applicable to the consumer's account is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Creditors that must disclose the amount of available credit must state the initial credit limit provided on the account.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Creditors must disclose directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an introductory rate may be revoked and the rate that will apply after the introductory rate is revoked. Issuers of credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan are subject to

limitations on the circumstances under which an introductory rate may be revoked. (See comment 5a(b)(1)-5 for guidance on how a card issuer may disclose the circumstances under which an introductory rate may be revoked.)</p><p class="depth0">ix. The applicable forms providing safe harbors for account-opening tables are under appendix G-17 to part 226.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to Sec. 226.6 disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Terminology. Section 226.6(b)(1) generally requires that the headings, content, and format of the tabular disclosures be substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the tables in appendix G to part 226; but see Sec. 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to Sec. 226.6(b).</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2) Required disclosures for account-opening table for open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(iii) Fixed finance charge; minimum interest charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of brief statement. See Samples G-17(B), G-17(C), and G-17(D) for guidance on how to provide a brief description of a minimum interest charge.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(v) Grace period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period. Creditors must state any conditions on the applicability of the grace period. A creditor, however, may not disclose under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(v) the limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 226.54, or the impact of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on transactions as a result of a loss of a grace period. Some creditors may offer a grace period on all types of transactions under which interest will not be charged on transactions if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(v) requires that the creditor disclose the grace period and the conditions for its applicability using the following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on your account if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.'' However, other creditors may offer a grace period on all types of transactions under which interest may be charged on transactions even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period.</p><p class="depth0">2. No grace period. Creditors may use the following language to describe that no grace period is offered, as applicable: ``We will begin charging interest on [applicable transactions] on the transaction date.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace period on some features. Some creditors do not offer a grace period on cash advances and balance transfers, but offer a grace period for all purchases under which interest will not be charged on purchases if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(v) requires that the creditor disclose the grace period for purchases and the conditions for its applicability, and the lack of a grace period for cash advances and balance transfers using the following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.'' However, other creditors may offer a grace period on all purchases under which interest may be charged on purchases even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.6(a)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period. Also, some creditors may not offer a grace period on cash advances and balance transfers, and will begin charging interest on these transactions from a date other than the transaction date, such as the posting date. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.6(a)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to be accurate.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(vi) Balance computation method.</p><p class="depth0">1. Use of same balance computation method for all features. In cases where the balance for each feature is computed using the same balance computation method, a single identification of the name of the balance computation method is sufficient. In this case, a creditor may use an appropriate name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'') to satisfy the requirement to disclose the name of the method for all features on the account, even though the name only refers to purchases. For example, if a creditor uses the average daily balance method including new transactions for all features, a creditor may use the name ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'' listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(i) to satisfy the requirement to disclose the name of the balance computation method for all features. As an alternative, in this situation, a creditor may revise the balance computation names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to refer more broadly to all new credit transactions, such as using the language ``new transactions'' or

``current transactions'' (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new transactions)''), rather than simply referring to new purchases when the same method is used to calculate the balances for all features of the account. See Samples G-17(B) and G-17(C) for guidance on how to disclose the balance computation method where the same method is used for all features on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of balance computation names in Sec. 226.5a(g) for balances other than purchases. The names of the balance computation methods listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) describe balance computation methods for purchases. When a creditor is disclosing the name of the balance computation methods separately for each feature, in using the names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(vi) for features other than purchases, a creditor must revise the names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to refer to the other features. For example, when disclosing the name of the balance computation method applicable to cash advances, a creditor must revise the name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(i) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (including new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance (including new cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. Similarly, a creditor must revise the name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(ii) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (excluding new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance (excluding new cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. See comment 6(b)(2)(vi)-1 for guidance on the use of one balance computation name when the same balance computation method is used for all features on the account.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(xiii) Available credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Right to reject the plan. Creditors may use the following language to describe consumers' right to reject a plan after receiving account-opening disclosures: ``You may still reject this plan, provided that you have not yet used the account or paid a fee after receiving a billing statement. If you do reject the plan, you are not responsible for any fees or charges.''</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(3) Disclosure of charges imposed as part of open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. When finance charges accrue. Creditors are not required to disclose a specific date when a cost that is a finance charge under Sec. 226.4 will begin to accrue.</p><p class="depth0">2. Grace periods. In disclosing in the account agreement or disclosure statement whether or not a grace period exists, the creditor need not use any particular descriptive phrase or term. However, the descriptive phrase or term must be sufficiently similar to the disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) and 226.6(b)(2)(v) to satisfy a creditor's duty to provide consistent terminology under Sec. 226.5(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. No finance charge imposed below certain balance. Creditors are not required to disclose the fact that no finance charge is imposed when the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount or the balance below which no finance charge will be imposed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to use the plan as agreed. Late payment fees, over-the-limit fees, and fees for payments returned unpaid are examples of charges resulting from consumers' failure to use the plan as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of fees that affect the plan. Examples of charges the payment, or nonpayment, of which affects the consumer's account are:</p><p class="depth0">i. Access to the plan. Fees for using the card at the creditor's ATM to obtain a cash advance, fees to obtain additional cards including replacements for lost or stolen cards, fees to expedite delivery of cards or other credit devices, application and membership fees, and annual or other participation fees identified in Sec. 226.4(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Amount of credit extended. Fees for increasing the credit limit on the account, whether at the consumer's request or unilaterally by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Timing or method of billing or payment. Fees to pay by telephone or via the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">3. Threshold test. If the creditor is unsure whether a particular charge is a cost imposed as part of the plan, the creditor may at its option consider such charges as a cost imposed as part of the plan for purposes of the Truth in Lending Act.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(3)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees for package of services. A fee to join a credit union is an example of a fee for a package of services that is not imposed as part of the plan, even if the consumer must join the credit union to apply for credit. In contrast, a membership fee is an example of a fee for a package of services that is considered to be imposed as part of a plan where the primary benefit of membership in the organization is the opportunity to apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4) Disclosure of rates for open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Range of balances. Creditors are not required to disclose the range of balances:</p><p class="depth0">i. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire account balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire balance for a feature (for example, cash advances), even though the balance for another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a 1.5% monthly

periodic interest rate on purchase balances of $0-$500, and a 1% periodic interest rate for balances above $500). In this example, the creditor must give a range of balances disclosure for the purchase feature.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(4)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Explanation of balance computation method. Creditors do not provide a sufficient explanation of a balance computation method by using a shorthand phrase such as ``previous balance method'' or the name of a balance computation method listed in Sec. 226.5a(g). (See Model Clauses G-1(A) in appendix G to part 226. See Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(vi) regarding balance computation descriptions in the account-opening summary.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how payments and other credits are allocated to outstanding balances.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(ii) Variable-rate accounts.</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate disclosures--coverage.</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples. Examples of open-end plans that permit the rate to change and are considered variable-rate plans include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are tied to the rate the creditor pays on its six-month certificates of deposit.</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates.</p><p class="depth0">C. Rate changes that are tied to changes in the creditor's commercial lending rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of open-end plans that permit the rate to change and are not considered variable-rate include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are invoked under a creditor's contract reservation to increase the rate without reference to such an index or formula (for example, a plan that simply provides that the creditor reserves the right to raise its rates).</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are triggered by a specific event such as an open-end credit plan in which the employee receives a lower rate contingent upon employment, and the rate increases upon termination of employment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate plan--circumstances for increase.</p><p class="depth0">i. The following are examples that comply with the requirement to disclose circumstances under which the rate(s) may increase:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``The Treasury bill rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``The Federal Reserve discount rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Disclosing the frequency with which the rate may increase includes disclosing when the increase will take effect; for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``An increase will take effect on the day that the Treasury bill rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate will take effect on the first day of the creditor's billing cycle.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate plan--limitations on increase. In disclosing any limitations on rate increases, limitations such as the maximum increase per year or the maximum increase over the duration of the plan must be disclosed. When there are no limitations, the creditor may, but need not, disclose that fact. Legal limits such as usury or rate ceilings under state or federal statutes or regulations need not be disclosed. Examples of limitations that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. ``The rate on the plan will not exceed 25% annual percentage rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``Not more than \1/2\ of 1% increase in the annual percentage rate per year will occur.''</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable-rate plan--effects of increase. Examples of effects of rate increases that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any requirement for additional collateral if the annual percentage rate increases beyond a specified rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any increase in the scheduled minimum periodic payment amount.</p><p class="depth0">5. Discounted variable-rate plans. In some variable-rate plans, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent margin. If the current Treasury bill rate is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 percent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent, or the creditor may disregard the index or formula and set the initial rate at 9 percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When creditors disclose in the account-opening disclosures an initial rate that is not calculated using the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the disclosure should reflect:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial rate (expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual percentage rate), together with a statement of how long the initial rate will remain in effect;</p><p class="depth0">B. The current rate that would have been applied using the index or formula (also expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual percentage rate); and</p><p class="depth0">C. The other variable-rate information required by Sec. 226.6(b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(iii) Rate changes not due to index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">1. Events that cause the initial rate to change.</p><p class="depth0">i. Changes based on expiration of time period. If the initial rate will change at the expiration of a time period, creditors that disclose the initial rate in the account-opening disclosure must identify the expiration date and the fact that the initial rate will end at that time.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changes based on specified contract terms. If the account agreement provides that the creditor may change the initial rate upon the occurrence of a specified event or events, the creditor must identify the events or

events. Examples include the consumer not making the required minimum payment when due, or the termination of an employee preferred rate when the employment relationship is terminated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rate that will apply after initial rate changes.</p><p class="depth0">i. Increased margins. If the initial rate is based on an index and the rate may increase due to a change in the margin applied to the index, the creditor must disclose the increased margin. If more than one margin could apply, the creditor may disclose the highest margin.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Risk-based pricing. In some plans, the amount of the rate change depends on how the creditor weighs the occurrence of events specified in the account agreement that authorize the creditor to change rates, as well as other factors. Creditors must state the increased rate that may apply. At the creditor's option, the creditor may state the possible rates as a range, or by stating only the highest rate that could be assessed. The creditor must disclose the period for which the increased rate will remain in effect, such as ``until you make three timely payments,'' or if there is no limitation, the fact that the increased rate may remain indefinitely.</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of rate change on balances. Creditors must disclose information to consumers about the balance to which the new rate will apply and the balance to which the current rate at the time of the change will apply. Card issuers subject to Sec. 226.55 may be subject to certain restrictions on the application of increased rates to certain balances.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5) Additional disclosures for open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(i) Voluntary credit insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. Under Sec. 226.4(d), disclosures required to exclude the cost of voluntary credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage from the finance charge must be provided before the consumer agrees to the purchase of the insurance or coverage. Creditors comply with Sec. 226.6(b)(5)(i) if they provide those disclosures in accordance with Sec. 226.4(d). For example, if the disclosures required by Sec. 226.4(d) are provided at application, creditors need not repeat those disclosures at account opening.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(ii) Security interests.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors are not required to use specific terms to describe a security interest, or to explain the type of security or the creditor's rights with respect to the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification of property. Creditors sufficiently identify collateral by type by stating, for example, motor vehicle or household appliances. (Creditors should be aware, however, that the federal credit practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit certain security interests in household goods.) The creditor may, at its option, provide a more specific identification (for example, a model and serial number.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. If collateral for preexisting credit with the creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor must disclose that fact. (Such security interests may be known as ``spreader'' or ``dragnet'' clauses, or as ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) The creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan'' is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Additional collateral. If collateral is required when advances reach a certain amount, the creditor should disclose the information available at the time of the account-opening disclosures. For example, if the creditor knows that a security interest will be taken in household goods if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, the creditor should disclose accordingly. If the creditor knows that security will be required if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, but the creditor does not know what security will be required, the creditor must disclose on the initial disclosure statement that security will be required if the balance exceeds $1,000, and the creditor must provide a change-in-terms notice under Sec. 226.9(c) at the time the security is taken. (See comment 6(b)(5)(ii)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Collateral from third party. Security interests taken in connection with the plan must be disclosed, whether the collateral is owned by the consumer or a third party.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(iii) Statement of billing rights.</p><p class="depth0">1. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3(A) and G-4(A).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.7--Periodic Statement</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. Some plans involve a number of different features, such as purchases, cash advances, or overdraft checking. Groups of transactions subject to different finance charge terms because of the dates on which the transactions took place are treated like different features for purposes of disclosures on the periodic statements. The commentary includes additional guidance for multifeatured plans.</p><p class="depth0">7(a) Rules affecting home-equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(1) Previous balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. If the previous balance is a credit balance, it must be disclosed in such a way so as to inform the consumer that it is a credit balance, rather than a debit balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the previous balance may be disclosed either as an aggregate balance for the account or as separate balances for each feature (for example, a previous balance for purchases and a previous balance for cash advances). If separate balances are disclosed, a total previous balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some open-end credit plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the previous balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(2) Identification of transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. In identifying transactions under Sec. 226.7(a)(2) for multifeatured plans, creditors may, for example, choose to arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing sale transactions separately from cash advance transactions) or in some other clear manner, such as by arranging the transactions in general chronological order.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated teller machine (ATM) charges imposed by other institutions in shared or interchange systems. A charge imposed on the cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system and included by the terminal-operating institution in the amount of the transaction need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(3) Credits.</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification--sufficiency. The creditor need not describe each credit by type (returned merchandise, rebate of finance charge, etc.)--``credit'' would suffice--except if the creditor is using the periodic statement to satisfy the billing-error correction notice requirement. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.13(e) and (f).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. A creditor may list credits relating to credit extensions (payments, rebates, etc.) together with other types of credits (such as deposits to a checking account), as long as the entries are identified so as to inform the consumer which type of credit each entry represents.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date. If only one date is disclosed (that is, the crediting date as required by the regulation), no further identification of that date is necessary. More than one date may be disclosed for a single entry, as long as it is clear which date represents the date on which credit was given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Totals. A total of amounts credited during the billing cycle is not required.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(4) Periodic rates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of periodic rates--whether or not actually applied. Except as provided in Sec. 226.7(a)(4)(ii), any periodic rate that may be used to compute finance charges (and its corresponding annual percentage rate) must be disclosed whether or not it is applied during the billing cycle. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash advance feature, the creditor must disclose the rate for each, even if the consumer only makes purchases on the account during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the rate varies (such as when it is tied to a particular index), the creditor must disclose each rate in effect during the cycle for which the statement was issued.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of periodic rates required only if imposition possible. With regard to the periodic rate disclosure (and its corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates that could have been imposed during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement need to be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor is changing rates effective during the next billing cycle (because of a variable-rate plan), the rates required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.7(a)(4) are only those in effect during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if the monthly rate applied during May was 1.5%, but the creditor will increase the rate to 1.8% effective June 1, 1.5% (and its corresponding annual percentage rate) is the only required disclosure under Sec. 226.7(a)(4) for the periodic statement reflecting the May account activity.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If rates applicable to a particular type of transaction changed after a certain date and the old rate is only being applied to transactions that took place prior to that date, the creditor need not continue to disclose the old rate for those consumers that have no outstanding balances to which that rate could be applied.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple rates--same transaction. If two or more periodic rates are applied to the same balance for the same type of transaction (for example, if the finance charge consists of a monthly periodic rate of 1.5% applied to the outstanding balance and a required credit life insurance component calculated at 0.1% per month on the same outstanding balance), the creditor may do either of the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Disclose each periodic rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding annual percentage rate for each. (For example, 1.5% monthly, 18% annual percentage rate; 0.1% monthly, 1.2% annual percentage rate.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Disclose one composite periodic rate (that is, 1.6% per month) along with the applicable range of balances and the corresponding annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Corresponding annual percentage rate. In disclosing the annual percentage rate that corresponds to each periodic rate, the creditor may use ``corresponding annual percentage rate,'' ``nominal annual percentage rate,'' ``corresponding nominal annual percentage rate,'' or similar phrases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rate same as actual annual percentage rate. When the corresponding rate is the same as the annual percentage rate disclosed under Sec. 226.7(a)(7), the creditor need disclose only one annual percentage rate, but must use the phrase ``annual percentage rate.''</p><p class="depth0">6. Range of balances. See comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-1. A creditor is not required to adjust the range of balances disclosure to reflect the balance below which only a minimum charge applies.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(5) Balance on which finance charge computed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitation to periodic rates. Section 226.7(a)(5) only requires disclosure of the balance(s) to which a periodic rate was applied and does not apply to balances on which other kinds of finance charges (such as transaction charges) were imposed. For example, if a consumer obtains a $1,500 cash advance subject to both a 1% transaction fee and a 1% monthly periodic rate, the creditor need only disclose the balance subject to the monthly rate (which might include portions of earlier cash advances not paid off in previous cycles).</p><p class="depth0">2. Split rates applied to balance ranges. If split rates were applied to a balance because different portions of the balance fall within two or more balance ranges, the creditor need not separately disclose the portions of the balance subject to such different rates since the range of balances to which the rates apply has been separately disclosed. For example, a creditor could disclose a balance of $700 for purchases even though a monthly periodic rate of 1.5% applied to the first $500, and a monthly periodic rate of 1% to the remainder. This option to disclose a combined balance does not apply when the finance charge is computed by applying the split rates to each day's balance (in contrast, for example, to applying the rates to the average daily balance). In that case, the balances must be disclosed using any of the options that are available if two or more daily rates are imposed. (See comment 7(a)(5)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Monthly rate on average daily balance. Creditors may apply a monthly periodic rate to an average daily balance.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must disclose a separate balance (or balances, as applicable) to which a periodic rate was applied for each feature or group of features subject to different periodic rates or different balance computation methods. Separate balances are not required, however, merely because a grace period is available for some features but not others. A total balance for the entire plan is optional. This does not affect how many balances the creditor must disclose--or may disclose--within each feature. (See, for example, comment 7(a)(5)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Daily rate on daily balances. i. If the finance charge is computed on the balance each day by application of one or more daily periodic rates, the balance on which the finance charge was computed may be disclosed in any of the following ways for each feature:</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a single daily periodic rate is imposed, the balance to which it is applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. The sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">D. The average daily balance during the billing cycle, in which case the creditor shall explain that the average daily balance is or can be multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle and the periodic rate applied to the product to determine the amount of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If two or more daily periodic rates may be imposed, the balances to which the rates are applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. Two or more average daily balances, each applicable to the daily periodic rates imposed for the time that those rates were in effect, as long as the creditor explains that the finance charge is or may be determined by (1) multiplying each of the average balances by the number of days in the billing cycle (or if the daily rate varied during the cycle, by multiplying by the number of days the applicable rate was in effect), (2) multiplying each of the results by the applicable daily periodic rate, and (3) adding these products together.</p><p class="depth0">6. Explanation of balance computation method. See the commentary to 6(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">7. Information to compute balance. In connection with disclosing the finance charge balance, the creditor need not give the consumer all of the information necessary to compute the balance if that information is not otherwise required to be disclosed. For example, if current purchases are included from the date they are posted to the account, the posting date need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">8. Non-deduction of credits. The creditor need not specifically identify the total dollar amount of credits not deducted in computing the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not deducted is accomplished by listing the credits (Sec. 226.7(a)(3)) and indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining the balance (for example, ``credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in computing the finance charge.'').</p><p class="depth0">9. Use of one balance computation method explanation when multiple balances disclosed. Sometimes the creditor will disclose more than one balance to which a periodic rate was applied, even though each balance was computed using the same balance computation method. For example, if a plan involves purchases and cash advances that are subject to different rates, more than one balance

must be disclosed, even though the same computation method is used for determining the balance for each feature. In these cases, one explanation of the balance computation method is sufficient. Sometimes the creditor separately discloses the portions of the balance that are subject to different rates because different portions of the balance fall within two or more balance ranges, even when a combined balance disclosure would be permitted under comment 7(a)(5)-2. In these cases, one explanation of the balance computation method is also sufficient (assuming, of course, that all portions of the balance were computed using the same method).</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(6) Amount of finance charge and other charges.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 7(a)(6)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Total. A total finance charge amount for the plan is not required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization--types of finance charges. Each type of finance charge (such as periodic rates, transaction charges, and minimum charges) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized; for example, disclosure of only a combined finance charge attributable to both a minimum charge and transaction charges would not be permissible. Finance charges of the same type may be disclosed, however, individually or as a total. For example, five transaction charges of $1 may be listed separately or as $5.</p><p class="depth0">3. Itemization--different periodic rates. Whether different periodic rates are applicable to different types of transactions or to different balance ranges, the creditor may give the finance charge attributable to each rate or may give a total finance charge amount. For example, if a creditor charges 1.5% per month on the first $500 of a balance and 1% per month on amounts over $500, the creditor may itemize the two components ($7.50 and $1.00) of the $8.50 charge, or may disclose $8.50.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, in disclosing the amount of the finance charge attributable to the application of periodic rates no total periodic rate disclosure for the entire plan need be given.</p><p class="depth0">5. Finance charges not added to account. A finance charge that is not included in the new balance because it is payable to a third party (such as required life insurance) must still be shown on the periodic statement as a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">6. Finance charges other than periodic rates. See comment 6(a)(1)(iv)-1 for examples.</p><p class="depth0">7. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, no disclosure is required of finance charges that have accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">8. Start-up fees. Points, loan fees, and similar finance charges relating to the opening of the account that are paid prior to the issuance of the first periodic statement need not be disclosed on the periodic statement. If, however, these charges are financed as part of the plan, including charges that are paid out of the first advance, the charges must be disclosed as part of the finance charge on the first periodic statement. However, they need not be factored into the annual percentage rate. (See Sec. 226.14(c)(3).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 7(a)(6)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification. In identifying any other charges actually imposed during the billing cycle, the type is adequately described as late charge or membership fee, for example. Similarly, closing costs or settlement costs, for example, may be used to describe charges imposed in connection with real estate transactions that are excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(7), if the same term (such as closing costs) was used in the initial disclosures and if the creditor chose to itemize and individually disclose the costs included in that term. Even though the taxes and filing or notary fees excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(e) are not required to be disclosed as other charges under Sec. 226.6(a)(2), these charges may be included in the amount shown as closing costs or settlement costs on the periodic statement, if the charges were itemized and disclosed as part of the closing costs or settlement costs on the initial disclosure statement.

Disclosure of the total amount of other charges is optional.</p><p class="depth0">4. Itemization--types of other charges. Each type of other charge (such as late-payment charges, over-the-credit-limit charges, and membership fees) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized; for example, disclosure of only a total of other charges attributable to both an over-the-credit-limit charge and a late-payment charge would not be permissible. Other charges of the same type may be disclosed, however, individually or as a total. For example, three fees of $3 for providing copies related to the resolution of a billing error could be listed separately or as $9.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(7) Annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, creditors are not required to disclose an effective annual percentage rate. Creditors that state an annualized rate in addition to the corresponding annual percentage rate required by Sec. 226.7(a)(4) must calculate that rate in accordance with Sec. 226.14(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Labels. Creditors that choose to disclose an annual percentage rate calculated under Sec. 226.14(c) and label the figure as ``annual percentage rate'' must label the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate as the ``corresponding APR,'' ``nominal APR,'' or a similar phrase as provided in comment 7(a)(4)-4. Creditors also comply with the label requirement if the rate calculated under Sec. 226.14(c) is described as the ``effective APR'' or something similar. For those creditors, the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate could be labeled ``annual percentage rate,'' consistent with the requirement under Sec. 226.7(b)(4). If the two rates represent different values, creditors must label the rates differently to meet the clear and conspicuous standard under Sec. 226.5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(8) Grace period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. Although the creditor is required to indicate any time period the consumer may have to pay the balance outstanding without incurring additional finance charges, no specific wording is required, so long as the language used is consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure statement. For example, ``To avoid additional finance charges, pay the new balance before --------'' would suffice.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(9) Address for notice of billing errors.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Telephone number. A telephone number, e-mail address, or Web site location may be included, but the mailing address for billing-error inquiries, which is the required disclosure, must be clear and conspicuous. The address is deemed to be clear and conspicuous if a precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the creditor by e-mail or Web site will not preserve the consumer's billing rights, unless the creditor has agreed to treat billing error notices provided by electronic means as written notices, in which case the precautionary instruction is required only for telephoning.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(10) Closing date of billing cycle; new balance.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Some plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b) Rules affecting open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest or similar transactions. Creditors offer a variety of payment plans for purchases that permit consumers to avoid interest charges if the purchase balance is paid in full by a certain date. ``Deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. The following provides guidance for a deferred interest or similar plan where, for example, no interest charge is imposed on a $500 purchase made in January if the $500 balance is paid by July 31.</p><p class="depth0">i. Annual percentage rates. Under Sec. 226.7(b)(4), creditors must disclose each annual percentage rate that may be used to compute the interest charge. Under some plans with a deferred interest or similar feature, if the deferred interest balance is not paid by a certain date, July 31 in this example, interest charges applicable to the billing cycles between the date of purchase in January and July 31 may be imposed. Annual percentage rates that may apply to the deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) if the balance is not paid in full by July 31 must appear on periodic statements for the billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31. However, if the consumer does not pay the deferred interest balance by July 31, the creditor is not required to identify, on the periodic statement disclosing the interest charge for the deferred interest balance, annual percentage rates that have been disclosed in previous billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Balances subject to periodic rates. Under Sec. 226.7(b)(5), creditors must disclose the balances subject to interest during a billing cycle. The deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) is not subject to interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31 in this example. Periodic statements sent for those billing cycles should not include the deferred interest balance in the balance disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(5). This amount must be separately disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term other than the term used to identify the balance disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(5) (such as ``deferred interest balance''). During any billing cycle in which an interest charge on the deferred interest balance is debited to the account, the balance disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(5) should include the deferred interest balance for that billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amount of interest charge. Under Sec. 226.7(b)(6)(ii), creditors must disclose interest charges imposed during a billing cycle. For some deferred interest purchases, the creditor may impose interest from the date of purchase if the deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) is not paid in full by July 31 in this example, but otherwise will

not impose interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase and July 31. Periodic statements for billing cycles preceding July 31 in this example should not include in the interest charge disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(6)(ii) the amounts a consumer may owe if the deferred interest balance is not paid in full by July 31. In this example, the February periodic statement should not identify as interest charges interest attributable to the $500 January purchase. This amount must be separately disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term other than ``interest charge'' (such as ``contingent interest charge'' or ``deferred interest charge''). The interest charge on a deferred interest balance should be reflected on the periodic statement under Sec. 226.7(b)(6)(ii) for the billing cycle in which the interest charge is debited to the account.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Due date to avoid obligation for finance charges under a deferred interest or similar program. Section 226.7(b)(14) requires disclosure on periodic statements of the date by which any outstanding balance subject to a deferred interest or similar program must be paid in full in order to avoid the obligation for finance charges on such balance. This disclosure must appear on the front of any page of each periodic statement issued during the deferred interest period beginning with the first periodic statement issued during the deferred interest period that reflects the deferred interest or similar transaction.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(1) Previous balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. If the previous balance is a credit balance, it must be disclosed in such a way so as to inform the consumer that it is a credit balance, rather than a debit balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the previous balance may be disclosed either as an aggregate balance for the account or as separate balances for each feature (for example, a previous balance for purchases and a previous balance for cash advances). If separate balances are disclosed, a total previous balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some open-end credit plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the previous balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(2) Identification of transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. Creditors may, but are not required to, arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing purchase transactions separately from cash advance transactions). Pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(6), however, creditors must group all fees and all interest separately from transactions and may not disclose any fees or interest charges with transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated teller machine (ATM) charges imposed by other institutions in shared or interchange systems. A charge imposed on the cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system and included by the terminal-operating institution in the amount of the transaction need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(3) Credits.</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification--sufficiency. The creditor need not describe each credit by type (returned merchandise, rebate of finance charge, etc.)--``credit'' would suffice--except if the creditor is using the periodic statement to satisfy the billing-error correction notice requirement. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.13(e) and (f).) Credits may be distinguished from transactions in any way that is clear and conspicuous, for example, by use of debit and credit columns or by use of plus signs and/or minus signs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date. If only one date is disclosed (that is, the crediting date as required by the regulation), no further identification of that date is necessary. More than one date may be disclosed for a single entry, as long as it is clear which date represents the date on which credit was given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Totals. A total of amounts credited during the billing cycle is not required.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(4) Periodic rates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of periodic interest rates--whether or not actually applied. Except as provided in Sec. 226.7(b)(4)(ii), any periodic interest rate that may be used to compute finance charges, expressed as and labeled ``Annual Percentage Rate,'' must be disclosed whether or not it is applied during the billing cycle. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash advance feature, the creditor must disclose the annual percentage rate for each, even if the consumer only makes purchases on the account during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the annual percentage rate varies (such as when it is tied to a particular index), the creditor must disclose each annual percentage rate in effect during the cycle for which the statement was issued.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of periodic interest rates required only if imposition possible. With regard to the periodic interest rate disclosure (and its corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates that could have been imposed during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement need to be disclosed. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor is changing annual percentage rates effective during the next billing cycle (either because it is changing terms or because of a variable-rate plan), the

annual percentage rates required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(4) are only those in effect during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if the annual percentage rate applied during May was 18%, but the creditor will increase the rate to 21% effective June 1, 18% is the only required disclosure under Sec. 226.7(b)(4) for the periodic statement reflecting the May account activity.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer has an overdraft line that might later be expanded upon the consumer's request to include secured advances, the rates for the secured advance feature need not be given until such time as the consumer has requested and received access to the additional feature.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If annual percentage rates applicable to a particular type of transaction changed after a certain date and the old rate is only being applied to transactions that took place prior to that date, the creditor need not continue to disclose the old rate for those consumers that have no outstanding balances to which that rate could be applied.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple rates--same transaction. If two or more periodic rates are applied to the same balance for the same type of transaction (for example, if the interest charge consists of a monthly periodic interest rate of 1.5% applied to the outstanding balance and a required credit life insurance component calculated at 0.1% per month on the same outstanding balance), creditors must disclose the periodic interest rate, expressed as an 18% annual percentage rate and the range of balances to which it is applicable. Costs attributable to the credit life insurance component must be disclosed as a fee under Sec. 226.7(b)(6)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Fees. Creditors that identify fees in accordance with Sec. 226.7(b)(6)(iii) need not identify the periodic rate at which a fee would accrue if the fee remains unpaid. For example, assume a fee is imposed for a late payment in the previous cycle and that the fee, unpaid, would be included in the purchases balance and accrue interest at the rate for purchases. The creditor need not separately disclose that the purchase rate applies to the portion of the purchases balance attributable to the unpaid fee.</p><p class="depth0">5. Ranges of balances. See comment 6(b)(4)(i)(B)-1. A creditor is not required to adjust the range of balances disclosure to reflect the balance below which only a minimum charge applies.</p><p class="depth0">6. Deferred interest transactions. See comment 7(b)-1.i.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(5) Balance on which finance charge computed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Split rates applied to balance ranges. If split rates were applied to a balance because different portions of the balance fall within two or more balance ranges, the creditor need not separately disclose the portions of the balance subject to such different rates since the range of balances to which the rates apply has been separately disclosed. For example, a creditor could disclose a balance of $700 for purchases even though a monthly periodic rate of 1.5% applied to the first $500, and a monthly periodic rate of 1% to the remainder. This option to disclose a combined balance does not apply when the interest charge is computed by applying the split rates to each day's balance (in contrast, for example, to applying the rates to the average daily balance). In that case, the balances must be disclosed using any of the options that are available if two or more daily rates are imposed. (See comment 7(b)(5)-4.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Monthly rate on average daily balance. Creditors may apply a monthly periodic rate to an average daily balance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must disclose a separate balance (or balances, as applicable) to which a periodic rate was applied for each feature. Separate balances are not required, however, merely because a grace period is available for some features but not others. A total balance for the entire plan is optional. This does not affect how many balances the creditor must disclose--or may disclose--within each feature. (See, for example, comments 7(b)(5)-4 and 7(b)(4)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Daily rate on daily balance. i. If a finance charge is computed on the balance each day by application of one or more daily periodic interest rates, the balance on which the interest charge was computed may be disclosed in any of the following ways for each feature</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a single daily periodic interest rate is imposed, the balance to which it is applicable may be stated as</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. The sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">D. The average daily balance during the billing cycle, in which case the creditor may, at its option, explain that the average daily balance is or can be multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle and the periodic rate applied to the product to determine the amount of interest.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If two or more daily periodic interest rates may be imposed, the balances to which the rates are applicable may be stated as</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. Two or more average daily balances, each applicable to the daily periodic interest rates imposed for the time that those rates

were in effect. The creditor may, at its option, explain that interest is or may be determined by (1) multiplying each of the average balances by the number of days in the billing cycle (or if the daily rate varied during the cycle, by multiplying by the number of days the applicable rate was in effect), (2) multiplying each of the results by the applicable daily periodic rate, and (3) adding these products together.</p><p class="depth0">5. Information to compute balance. In connection with disclosing the interest charge balance, the creditor need not give the consumer all of the information necessary to compute the balance if that information is not otherwise required to be disclosed. For example, if current purchases are included from the date they are posted to the account, the posting date need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">6. Non-deduction of credits. The creditor need not specifically identify the total dollar amount of credits not deducted in computing the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not deducted is accomplished by listing the credits (Sec. 226.7(b)(3)) and indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining the balance (for example, ``credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in computing the interest charge.'').</p><p class="depth0">7. Use of one balance computation method explanation when multiple balances disclosed. Sometimes the creditor will disclose more than one balance to which a periodic rate was applied, even though each balance was computed using the same balance computation method. For example, if a plan involves purchases and cash advances that are subject to different rates, more than one balance must be disclosed, even though the same computation method is used for determining the balance for each feature. In these cases, one explanation or a single identification of the name of the balance computation method is sufficient. Sometimes the creditor separately discloses the portions of the balance that are subject to different rates because different portions of the balance fall within two or more balance ranges, even when a combined balance disclosure would be permitted under comment 7(b)(5)-1. In these cases, one explanation or a single identification of the name of the balance computation method is also sufficient (assuming, of course, that all portions of the balance were computed using the same method). In these cases, a creditor may use an appropriate name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'') as the single identification of the name of the balance computation method applicable to all features, even though the name only refers to purchases. For example, if a creditor uses the average daily balance method including new transactions for all features, a creditor may use the name ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'' listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(i) to satisfy the requirement to disclose the name of the balance computation method for all features. As an alternative, in this situation, a creditor may revise the balance computation names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to refer more broadly to all new credit transactions, such as using the language ``new transactions'' or ``current transactions'' (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new transactions)''), rather than simply referring to new purchases, when the same method is used to calculate the balances for all features of the account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Use of balance computation names in Sec. 226.5a(g) for balances other than purchases. The names of the balance computation methods listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) describe balance computation methods for purchases. When a creditor is disclosing the name of the balance computation methods separately for each feature, in using the names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(5) for features other than purchases, a creditor must revise the names listed in Sec. 226.5a(g) to refer to the other features. For example, when disclosing the name of the balance computation method applicable to cash advances, a creditor must revise the name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(i) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (including new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance (including new cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. Similarly, a creditor must revise the name listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)(ii) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (excluding new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance (excluding new cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. See comment 7(b)(5)-7 for guidance on the use of one balance computation method explanation or name when multiple balances are disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(6) Charges imposed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of charges. See commentary to Sec. 226.6(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees. Costs attributable to periodic rates other than interest charges shall be disclosed as a fee. For example, if a consumer obtains credit life insurance that is calculated at 0.1% per month on an outstanding balance and a monthly interest rate of 1.5% applies to the same balance, the creditor must disclose the dollar cost attributable to interest as an ``interest charge'' and the credit insurance cost as a ``fee.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Total fees and interest charged for calendar year to date.</p><p class="depth0">i. Monthly statements. Some creditors send monthly statements but the statement periods do not coincide with the calendar month.

For creditors sending monthly statements, the following comply with the requirement to provide calendar year-to-date totals.</p><p class="depth0">A. A creditor may disclose calendar-year-to-date totals at the end of the calendar year by separately aggregating finance charges attributable to periodic interest rates and fees for 12 monthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during January and finishing with the period that begins during December. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering December 10, 2011 through January 9, 2012, may disclose the separate year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed from January 10, 2011, through January 9, 2012. Alternatively, the creditor could provide a statement for the cycle ending January 9, 2012, showing the separate year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">B. A creditor may disclose calendar-year-to-date totals at the end of the calendar year by separately aggregating finance charges attributable to periodic interest rates and fees for 12 monthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during December and finishing with the period that begins during November. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering November 10, 2011 through December 9, 2011, may disclose the separate year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed from December 10, 2010, through December 9, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Quarterly statements. Creditors issuing quarterly statements may apply the guidance set forth for monthly statements to comply with the requirement to provide calendar year-to-date totals on quarterly statements.</p><p class="depth0">4. Minimum charge in lieu of interest. A minimum charge imposed if a charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum must be disclosed as a fee. For example, assume a creditor imposes a minimum charge of $1.50 in lieu of interest if the calculated interest for a billing period is less than that minimum charge. If the interest calculated on a consumer's account for a particular billing period is 50 cents, the minimum charge of $1.50 would apply. In this case, the entire $1.50 would be disclosed as a fee; the periodic statement would reflect the $1.50 as a fee, and $0 in interest.</p><p class="depth0">5. Adjustments to year-to-date totals. In some cases, a creditor may provide a statement for the current period reflecting that fees or interest charges imposed during a previous period were waived or reversed and credited to the account. Creditors may, but are not required to, reflect the adjustment in the year-to-date totals, nor, if an adjustment is made, to provide an explanation about the reason for the adjustment. Such adjustments should not affect the total fees or interest charges imposed for the current statement period.</p><p class="depth0">6. Acquired accounts. An institution that acquires an account or plan must include, as applicable, fees and charges imposed on the account or plan prior to the acquisition in the aggregate disclosures provided under Sec. 226.7(b)(6) for the acquired account or plan. Alternatively, the institution may provide separate totals reflecting activity prior and subsequent to the account or plan acquisition. For example, a creditor that acquires an account or plan on August 12 of a given calendar year may provide one total for the period from January 1 to August 11 and a separate total for the period beginning on August 12.</p><p class="depth0">7. Account upgrades. A creditor that upgrades, or otherwise changes, a consumer's plan to a different open-end credit plan must include, as applicable, fees and charges imposed for that portion of the calendar year prior to the upgrade or change in the consumer's plan in the aggregate disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(6) for the new plan. For example, assume a consumer has incurred $125 in fees for the calendar year to date for a retail credit card account, which is then replaced by a cobranded credit card account also issued by the creditor. In this case, the creditor must reflect the $125 in fees incurred prior to the replacement of the retail credit card account in the calendar year-to-date totals provided for the cobranded credit card account. Alternatively, the institution may provide two separate totals reflecting activity prior and subsequent to the plan upgrade or change.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(7) Change-in-terms and increased penalty rate summary for open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Location of summary tables. If a change-in-terms notice required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2) is provided on or with a periodic statement, a tabular summary of key changes must appear on the front of the statement. Similarly, if a notice of a rate increase due to delinquency or default or as a penalty required by Sec. 226.9(g)(1) is provided on or with a periodic statement, information required to be provided about the increase, presented in a table, must appear on the front of the statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(8) Grace period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. In describing the grace period, the language used must be consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure statement. (See Sec. 226.5(a)(2)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred interest transactions. See comment 7(b)-1.iv.</p><p class="depth0">3. Limitation on the imposition of finance charges in Sec. 226.54. Section 226.7(b)(8) does not require a card issuer to disclose the limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 226.54, or the impact of payment allocation on

whether interest is charged on transactions as a result of a loss of a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(9) Address for notice of billing errors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. The periodic statement should indicate the general purpose for the address for billing-error inquiries, although a detailed explanation or particular wording is not required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Telephone number. A telephone number, e-mail address, or Web site location may be included, but the mailing address for billing-error inquiries, which is the required disclosure, must be clear and conspicuous. The address is deemed to be clear and conspicuous if a precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the creditor by e-mail or Web site will not preserve the consumer's billing rights, unless the creditor has agreed to treat billing error notices provided by electronic means as written notices, in which case the precautionary instruction is required only for telephoning.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(10) Closing date of billing cycle; new balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. See comment 7(b)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the new balance may be disclosed for each feature or for the plan as a whole. If separate new balances are disclosed, a total new balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(11) Due date; late payment costs.</p><p class="depth0">1. Informal periods affecting late payments. Although the terms of the account agreement may provide that a card issuer may assess a late payment fee if a payment is not received by a certain date, the card issuer may have an informal policy or practice that delays the assessment of the late payment fee for payments received a brief period of time after the date upon which a card issuer has the contractual right to impose the fee. A card issuer must disclose the due date according to the legal obligation between the parties, and need not consider the end of an informal ``courtesy period'' as the due date under Sec. 226.7(b)(11).</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment of late payment fees. Some state or other laws require that a certain number of days must elapse following a due date before a late payment fee may be imposed. In addition, a card issuer may be restricted by the terms of the account agreement from imposing a late payment fee until a payment is late for a certain number of days following a due date. For example, assume a payment is due on March 10 and the account agreement or state law provides that a late payment fee cannot be assessed before March 21. A card issuer must disclose the due date under the terms of the legal obligation (March 10 in this example), and not a date different than the due date, such as when the card issuer is restricted by the account agreement or state or other law from imposing a late payment fee unless a payment is late for a certain number of days following the due date (March 21 in this example). Consumers' rights under state law to avoid the imposition of late payment fees during a specified period following a due date are unaffected by the disclosure requirement. In this example, the card issuer would disclose March 10 as the due date for purposes of Sec. 226.7(b)(11), but could not, under state law, assess a late payment fee before March 21.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fee or rate triggered by multiple events. If a late payment fee or penalty rate is triggered after multiple events, such as two late payments in six months, the card issuer may, but is not required to, disclose the late payment and penalty rate disclosure each month. The disclosures must be included on any periodic statement for which a late payment could trigger the late payment fee or penalty rate, such as after the consumer made one late payment in this example. For example, if a cardholder has already made one late payment, the disclosure must be on each statement for the following five billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">4. Range of late fees or penalty rates. A card issuer that imposes a range of late payment fees or rates on a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may state the highest fee or rate along with an indication lower fees or rates could be imposed. For example, a phrase indicating the late payment fee could be ``up to $29'' complies with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">5. Penalty rate in effect. If the highest penalty rate has previously been triggered on an account, the card issuer may, but is not required to, delete the amount of the penalty rate and the warning that the rate may be imposed for an untimely payment, as not applicable. Alternatively, the card issuer may, but is not required to, modify the language to indicate that the penalty rate has been increased due to previous late payments (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">6. Same day each month. The requirement that the due date be the same day each month means that the due date must generally be the same numerical date. For example, a consumer's due date could be the 25th of every month. In contrast, a due date that is the same relative date but not numerical date each month, such as the third Tuesday of the month, generally would not comply with this requirement. However, a consumer's due date may be the last day of each month, even though that date will not be the same numerical date. For example, if

a consumer's due date is the last day of each month, it will fall on February 28th (or February 29th in a leap year) and on August 31st.</p><p class="depth0">7. Change in due date. A creditor may adjust a consumer's due date from time to time provided that the new due date will be the same numerical date each month on an ongoing basis. For example, a creditor may choose to honor a consumer's request to change from a due date that is the 20th of each month to the 5th of each month, or may choose to change a consumer's due date from time to time for operational reasons. See comment 2(a)(4)-3 for guidance on transitional billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">8. Billing cycles longer than one month. The requirement that the due date be the same day each month does not prohibit billing cycles that are two or three months, provided that the due date for each billing cycle is on the same numerical date of the month. For example, a creditor that establishes two-month billing cycles could send a consumer periodic statements disclosing due dates of January 25, March 25, and May 25.</p><p class="depth0">9. Payment due date when the creditor does not accept or receive payments by mail. If the due date in a given month falls on a day on which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail and the creditor is required to treat a payment received the next business day as timely pursuant to Sec. 226.10(d), the creditor must disclose the due date according to the legal obligation between the parties, not the date as of which the creditor is permitted to treat the payment as late. For example, assume that the consumer's due date is the 4th of every month and the creditor does not accept or receive payments by mail on Thursday, July 4. Pursuant to Sec. 226.10(d), the creditor may not treat a mailed payment received on the following business day, Friday, July 5, as late for any purpose. The creditor must nonetheless disclose July 4 as the due date on the periodic statement and may not disclose a July 5 due date.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12) Repayment disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding. In disclosing on the periodic statement the minimum payment total cost estimate, the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months, and the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months under Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) as applicable, a card issuer, at its option, must either round these disclosures to the nearest whole dollar or to the nearest cent. Nonetheless, an issuer's rounding for all of these disclosures must be consistent. An issuer may round all of these disclosures to the nearest whole dollar when disclosing them on the periodic statement, or may round all of these disclosures to the nearest cent. An issuer may not, however, round some of the disclosures to the nearest whole dollar, while rounding other disclosures to the nearest cent.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 7(b)(12)(i)(F).</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum payment repayment estimate disclosed on the periodic statement is three years or less. Section 226.7(b)(12)(i)(F)(2)(i) provides that a credit card issuer is not required to provide the disclosures related to repayment in 36 months if the minimum payment repayment estimate disclosed under Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B) after rounding is 3 years or less. For example, if the minimum payment repayment estimate is 2 years 6 months to 3 years 5 months, issuers would be required under Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i)(B) to disclose that it would take 3 years to pay off the balance in full if making only the minimum payment. In these cases, an issuer would not be required to disclose the 36-month disclosures on the periodic statement because the minimum payment repayment estimate disclosed to the consumer on the periodic statement (after rounding) is 3 years or less.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12)(iv) Provision of information about credit counseling services.</p><p class="depth0">1. Approved organizations. Section 226.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) requires card issuers to provide information regarding at least three organizations that have been approved by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(a)(1) to provide credit counseling services in, at the card issuer's option, either the state in which the billing address for the account is located or the state specified by the consumer. A card issuer does not satisfy the requirements in Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) by providing information regarding providers that have been approved pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(a)(2) to offer personal financial management courses.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information regarding approved organizations. i. Provision of information obtained from United States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator. A card issuer complies with the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) if, through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii), it provides the consumer with information obtained from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator, such as information obtained from the Web site operated by the United States Trustee. Section 226.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) does not require a card issuer to provide information that is not available from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. If, for example, the Web site address for an organization approved by the United States Trustee is not available from the Web site operated by the United States Trustee, a card issuer is not required to provide a Web site address for that organization. However, Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv)(B) requires the card issuer to, at least annually, update the information it provides for consistency with the information provided by the United

States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Provision of information consistent with request of approved organization. If requested by an approved organization, a card issuer may at its option provide, in addition to the name of the organization obtained from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator, another name used by that organization through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii). In addition, if requested by an approved organization, a card issuer may at its option provide through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) a street address, telephone number, or Web site address for the organization that is different than the street address, telephone number, or Web site address obtained from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. However, if requested by an approved organization, a card issuer must not provide information regarding that organization through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Information regarding approved organizations that provide credit counseling services in a language other than English. A card issuer may at its option provide through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) information regarding approved organizations that provide credit counseling services in languages other than English. In the alternative, a card issuer may at its option state that such information is available from the Web site operated by the United States Trustee. Disclosing this Web site address does not by itself constitute a statement that organizations have been approved by the United States Trustee for purposes of comment 7(b)(12)(iv)-2.iv.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Statements regarding approval by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. Section 226.7(b)(12)(iv) does not require a card issuer to disclose through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) that organizations have been approved by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. However, if a card issuer chooses to make such a disclosure, Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv) requires that the card issuer also disclose that</p><p class="depth0">A. The United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator has determined that the organizations meet the minimum requirements for nonprofit pre-bankruptcy budget and credit counseling;</p><p class="depth0">B. The organizations may provide other credit counseling services that have not been reviewed by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator; and</p><p class="depth0">C. The United States Trustee or the bankruptcy administrator does not endorse or recommend any particular organization.</p><p class="depth0">3. Automated response systems or devices. At their option, card issuers may use toll-free telephone numbers that connect consumers to automated systems, such as an interactive voice response system, through which consumers may obtain the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv) by inputting information using a touch-tone telephone or similar device.</p><p class="depth0">4. Toll-free telephone number. A card issuer may provide a toll-free telephone number that is designed to handle customer service calls generally, so long as the option to receive the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv) is prominently disclosed to the consumer. For automated systems, the option to receive the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv) is prominently disclosed to the consumer if it is listed as one of the options in the first menu of options given to the consumer, such as ``Press or say `3' if you would like information about credit counseling services.'' If the automated system permits callers to select the language in which the call is conducted and in which information is provided, the menu to select the language may precede the menu with the option to receive information about accessing credit counseling services.</p><p class="depth0">5. Third parties. At their option, card issuers may use a third party to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for use by the issuer to provide the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">6. Web site address. When making the repayment disclosures on the periodic statement pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(12), a card issuer at its option may also include a reference to a Web site address (in addition to the toll-free telephone number) where its customers may obtain the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv), so long as the information provided on the Web site complies with Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv). The Web site address disclosed must take consumers directly to the Web page where information about accessing credit counseling may be obtained. In the alternative, the card issuer may disclose the Web site address for the Web page operated by the United States Trustee where consumers may obtain information about approved credit counseling organizations. Disclosing this Web site address does not by itself constitute a statement that organizations have been approved by the United States Trustee for purposes of comment 7(b)(12)(iv)-2.iv.</p><p class="depth0">7. Advertising or marketing information. If a consumer requests information about credit counseling services, the card issuer may not provide advertisements or marketing materials to the consumer (except for providing the name of the issuer) prior to providing the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv). Educational materials that do not solicit business are not considered advertisements

or marketing materials for this purpose. Examples</p><p class="depth0">i. Toll-free telephone number. As described in comment 7(b)(12)(iv)-4, an issuer may provide a toll-free telephone number that is designed to handle customer service calls generally, so long as the option to receive the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv) through that toll-free telephone number is prominently disclosed to the consumer. Once the consumer selects the option to receive the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv), the issuer may not provide advertisements or marketing materials to the consumer (except for providing the name of the issuer) prior to providing the required information.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Web page. If the issuer discloses a link to a Web site address as part of the disclosures pursuant to comment 7(b)(12)(iv)-6, the issuer may not provide advertisements or marketing materials (except for providing the name of the issuer) on the Web page accessed by the address prior to providing the information required by Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12)(v) Exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Billing cycle where paying the minimum payment due for that billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on the account for that billing cycle. Under Sec. 226.7(b)(12)(v)(C), a card issuer is exempt from the repayment disclosure requirements set forth in Sec. 226.7(b)(12) for a particular billing cycle where paying the minimum payment due for that billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on the account for that billing cycle. For example, if the entire outstanding balance on an account for a particular billing cycle is $20 and the minimum payment is $20, an issuer would not need to comply with the repayment disclosure requirements for that particular billing cycle. In addition, this exemption would apply to a charged-off account where payment of the entire account balance is due immediately.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(13) Format requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Combined deposit account and credit account statements. Some financial institutions provide information about deposit account and open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. For purposes of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic statement pursuant to Sec. 226.7(b)(13), the first page of such a combined statement shall be the page on which credit transactions first appear.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.8--Identifying Transactions on Periodic Statements</p><p class="depth0">8(a) Sale credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Sale credit. The term ``sale credit'' refers to a purchase in which the consumer uses a credit card or otherwise directly accesses an open-end line of credit (see comment 8(b)-1 if access is by means of a check) to obtain goods or services from a merchant, whether or not the merchant is the card issuer or creditor. ``Sale credit'' includes:</p><p class="depth0">i. The purchase of funds-transfer services (such as a wire transfer) from an intermediary.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The purchase of services from the card issuer or creditor. For the purchase of services that are costs imposed as part of the plan under Sec. 226.6(b)(3), card issuers and creditors comply with the requirements for identifying transactions under this section by disclosing the fees in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(6). For the purchases of services that are not costs imposed as part of the plan, card issuers and creditors may, at their option, identify transactions under this section or in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.7(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount--transactions not billed in full. If sale transactions are not billed in full on any single statement, but are billed periodically in precomputed installments, the first periodic statement reflecting the transaction must show either the full amount of the transaction together with the date the transaction actually took place; or the amount of the first installment that was debited to the account together with the date of the transaction or the date on which the first installment was debited to the account. In any event, subsequent periodic statements should reflect each installment due, together with either any other identifying information required by Sec. 226.8(a) (such as the seller's name and address in a three-party situation) or other appropriate identifying information relating the transaction to the first billing. The debiting date for the particular installment, or the date the transaction took place, may be used as the date of the transaction on these subsequent statements.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date--when a transaction takes place.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer conducts the transaction in person, the date of the transaction is the calendar date on which the consumer made the purchase or order, or secured the advance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For transactions billed to the account on an ongoing basis (other than installments to pay a precomputed amount), the date of the transaction is the date on which the amount is debited to the account. This might include, for example, monthly insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">iii. For mail, Internet, or telephone orders, a creditor may disclose as the transaction date either the invoice date, the debiting date, or the date the order was placed by telephone or via the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In a foreign transaction, the debiting date may be considered the transaction date.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date--sufficiency of description.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor discloses only the date of the transaction, the creditor need not identify it as the ``transaction date.'' If the creditor discloses more than one date (for example, the transaction date and the posting date), the creditor must identify each.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The month and day sufficiently identify the transaction date, unless the posting of the transaction is delayed so long that the year is needed for a clear disclosure to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Same or related persons. i. For purposes of identifying transactions, the term same or related persons refers to, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Franchised or licensed sellers of a creditor's product or service.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sellers who assign or sell open-end sales accounts to a creditor or arrange for such credit under a plan that allows the consumer to use the credit only in transactions with that seller.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A seller is not related to the creditor merely because the seller and the creditor have an agreement authorizing the seller to honor the creditor's credit card.</p><p class="depth0">6. Brief identification--sufficiency of description. The ``brief identification'' provision in Sec. 226.8(a)(1)(i) requires a designation that will enable the consumer to reconcile the periodic statement with the consumer's own records. In determining the sufficiency of the description, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. While item-by-item descriptions are not necessary, reasonable precision is required. For example, ``merchandise,'' ``miscellaneous,'' ``second-hand goods,'' or ``promotional items'' would not suffice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A reference to a department in a sales establishment that accurately conveys the identification of the types of property or services available in the department is sufficient--for example, ``jewelry,'' or ``sporting goods.''</p><p class="depth0">iii. A number or symbol that is related to an identification list printed elsewhere on the statement that reasonably identifies the transaction with the creditor is sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">7. Seller's name--sufficiency of description. The requirement contemplates that the seller's name will appear on the periodic statement in essentially the same form as it appears on transaction documents provided to the consumer at the time of the sale. The seller's name may also be disclosed as, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A more complete spelling of the name that was alphabetically abbreviated on the receipt or other credit document.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An alphabetical abbreviation of the name on the periodic statement even if the name appears in a more complete spelling on the receipt or other credit document. Terms that merely indicate the form of a business entity, such as ``Inc.,'' ``Co.,'' or ``Ltd.,'' may always be omitted.</p><p class="depth0">8. Location of transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the seller has multiple stores or branches within a city, the creditor need not identify the specific branch at which the sale occurred.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When no meaningful address is available because the consumer did not make the purchase at any fixed location of the seller, the creditor may omit the address, or may provide some other identifying designation, such as ``aboard plane,'' ``ABC Airways Flight,'' ``customer's home,'' ``telephone order,'' ``Internet order'' or ``mail order.''</p><p class="depth0">8(b) Nonsale credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Nonsale credit. The term ``nonsale credit'' refers to any form of loan credit including, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An advance on a credit plan that is accessed by overdrafts on a checking account.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The use of a ``supplemental credit device'' in the form of a check or draft or the use of the overdraft credit plan accessed by a debit card, even if such use is in connection with a purchase of goods or services.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Miscellaneous debits to remedy mispostings, returned checks, and similar entries.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount--overdraft credit plans. If credit is extended under an overdraft credit plan tied to a checking account or by means of a debit card tied to an overdraft credit plan:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount to be disclosed is that of the credit extension, not the face amount of the check or the total amount of the debit/credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor may disclose the amount of the credit extensions on a cumulative daily basis, rather than the amount attributable to each check or each use of the debit card that accesses the credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date of transaction. See comment 8(a)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nonsale transaction--sufficiency of identification. The creditor sufficiently identifies a nonsale transaction by describing the type of advance it represents, such as cash advance, loan, overdraft loan, or any readily understandable trade name for the credit program.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.9--Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">9(a) Furnishing statement of billing rights.</p><p class="depth0">9(a)(1) Annual statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The creditor may provide the annual billing rights statement:</p><p class="depth0">i. By sending it in one billing period per year to each consumer that gets a periodic statement for that period; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. By sending a copy to all of its accountholders sometime during the calendar year but not necessarily all in one billing period (for example, sending the annual notice in connection with renewal cards or when imposing annual membership fees).</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantially similar. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3 and G-3(A) in appendix G to part 226.</p><p class="depth0">9(a)(2) Alternative summary statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing from long-form to short form statement and vice versa. If the creditor has been sending the long-form annual statement, and subsequently decides to use the alternative summary statement, the first summary statement must be sent no later than

12 months after the last long-form statement was sent. Conversely, if the creditor wants to switch to the long-form, the first long-form statement must be sent no later than 12 months after the last summary statement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantially similar. See the commentary to Model Forms G-4 and G-4(A) in appendix G to part 226.</p><p class="depth0">9(b) Disclosures for supplemental credit access devices and additional features.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit access device--examples. Credit access device includes, for example, a blank check, payee-designated check, blank draft or order, or authorization form for issuance of a check; it does not include a check issued payable to a consumer representing loan proceeds or the disbursement of a cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credit account feature--examples. A new credit account feature would include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The addition of overdraft checking to an existing account (although the regular checks that could trigger the overdraft feature are not themselves ``devices'').</p><p class="depth0">ii. The option to use an existing credit card to secure cash advances, when previously the card could only be used for purchases.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Different finance charge terms. Except as provided in Sec. 226.9(b)(3) for checks that access a credit card account, if the finance charge terms are different from those previously disclosed, the creditor may satisfy the requirement to give the finance charge terms either by giving a complete set of new account-opening disclosures reflecting the terms of the added device or feature or by giving only the finance charge disclosures for the added device or feature.</p><p class="depth0">9(b)(3) Checks that access a credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">9(b)(3)(i) Disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Front of the page containing the checks. The following would comply with the requirement that the tabular disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b)(3) appear on the front of the page containing the checks</p><p class="depth0">i. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of the first page on which checks appear, for an offer where checks are provided on multiple pages;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of a mini-book or accordion booklet containing the checks; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of the solicitation letter, when the checks are printed on the front of the same page as the solicitation letter even if the checks can be separated by the consumer from the solicitation letter using perforations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Combined disclosures for checks and other transactions subject to the same terms. A card issuer may include in the tabular disclosure provided pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b)(3) disclosures regarding the terms offered on non-check transactions, provided that such transactions are subject to the same terms that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b)(3)(i) for the checks that access a credit card account. However, a card issuer may not include in the table information regarding additional terms that are not required disclosures for checks that access a credit card account pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(b)(3)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period. A creditor may not disclose under Sec. 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) the limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 226.54, or the impact of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on transactions as a result of a loss of a grace period. Some creditors may offer a grace period on credit extended by the use of an access check under which interest will not be charged on the check transactions if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) requires that the creditor disclose the grace period using the following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on check transactions if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month.'' However, other creditors may offer a grace period on check transactions under which interest may be charged on check transactions even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.9(b)(3)(i)(D) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period. Creditors may use the following language to describe that no grace period on check transactions is offered, as applicable: ``We will begin charging interest on these checks on the transaction date.''</p><p class="depth0">9(c) Change in terms.</p><p class="depth0">9(c) Change in terms.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1) Rules affecting home-equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes initially disclosed. No notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially, such as: rate increases under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan, a rate increase that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment, or an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum. The rules in Sec. 226.5b(f) relating to home-equity plans limit the ability of a creditor to change the terms of such plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. State law issues. Examples of issues not addressed by Sec. 226.9(c) because they are controlled by state or other applicable law include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The types of changes a creditor may make. (But see Sec. 226.5b(f))</p><p class="depth0">ii. How changed terms affect existing balances, such as when a periodic rate is changed and the consumer does not pay off the entire existing balance before the new rate takes effect.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in billing cycle. Whenever the creditor changes the consumer's billing cycle, it must give a change-in-terms notice if the change either affects any of the terms required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(a) or increases the minimum payment, unless an exception under Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(ii) applies; for example, the creditor must give advance notice if the creditor initially disclosed a 25-day grace period on purchases and the consumer will have fewer days during the billing cycle change.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(i) Written notice required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Affected consumers. Change-in-terms notices need only go to those consumers who may be affected by the change. For example, a change in the periodic rate for check overdraft credit need not be disclosed to consumers who do not have that feature on their accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing--effective date of change. The rule that the notice of the change in terms be provided at least 15 days before the change takes effect permits mid-cycle changes when there is clearly no retroactive effect, such as the imposition of a transaction fee. Any change in the balance computation method, in contrast, would need to be disclosed at least 15 days prior to the billing cycle in which the change is to be implemented.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing--advance notice not required. Advance notice of 15 days is not necessary--that is, a notice of change in terms is required, but it may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change--in two circumstances:</p><p class="depth0">i. If there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer's delinquency or default.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer agrees to the particular change. This provision is intended for use in the unusual instance when a consumer substitutes collateral or when the creditor can advance additional credit only if a change relatively unique to that consumer is made, such as the consumer's providing additional security or paying an increased minimum payment amount. Therefore, the following are not ``agreements'' between the consumer and the creditor for purposes of Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(i): The consumer's general acceptance of the creditor's contract reservation of the right to change terms; the consumer's use of the account (which might imply acceptance of its terms under state law); and the consumer's acceptance of a unilateral term change that is not particular to that consumer, but rather is of general applicability to consumers with that type of account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Form of change-in-terms notice. A complete new set of the initial disclosures containing the changed term complies with Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(i) if the change is highlighted in some way on the disclosure statement, or if the disclosure statement is accompanied by a letter or some other insert that indicates or draws attention to the term change.</p><p class="depth0">5. Security interest change--form of notice. A copy of the security agreement that describes the collateral securing the consumer's account may be used as the notice, when the term change is the addition of a security interest or the addition or substitution of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">6. Changes to home-equity plans entered into on or after November 7, 1989. Section 226.9(c)(1) applies when, by written agreement under Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home-equity plan--entered into on or after November 7, 1989--at or before its scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on terms different from those of the original plan. In disclosing the change:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the index is changed, the maximum annual percentage rate is increased (to the limited extent permitted by Sec. 226.30), or a variable-rate feature is added to a fixed-rate plan, the creditor must include the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi), unless these disclosures are unchanged from those given earlier.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the minimum payment requirement is changed, the creditor must include the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii) (and, in variable-rate plans, the disclosures required by Sec. 226.5b(d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi)) unless the disclosures given earlier contained representative examples covering the new minimum payment requirement. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(x) and (d)(12)(xi) for a discussion of representative examples.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. When the terms are changed pursuant to a written agreement as described in Sec. 226.5b(f)(3)(iii), the advance-notice requirement does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(ii) Notice not required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes not requiring notice. The following are examples of changes that do not require a change-in-terms notice:</p><p class="depth0">i. A change in the consumer's credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A change in the name of the credit card or credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The substitution of one insurer for another.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A termination or suspension of credit privileges. (But see Sec. 226.5b(f).)</p><p class="depth0">v. Changes arising merely by operation of law; for example, if the creditor's security interest in a consumer's car automatically extends to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car.</p><p class="depth0">2. Skip features. If a credit program allows consumers to skip or reduce one or more payments during the year, or involves temporary reductions in finance charges, no notice of the change in terms is required either prior to the reduction or upon resumption of the higher rates or payments if these features are explained on the initial disclosure statement (including an explanation of the terms upon resumption). For example, a merchant may allow consumers to skip the December payment to encourage holiday shopping, or a teachers' credit union may not require payments during summer vacation. Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior to resuming the original schedule or rate, even though no notice is required prior to the reduction. The change-in-terms notice may be combined with the notice offering the reduction. For example, the periodic statement reflecting the reduction or skip feature may also be used to notify the consumer of the resumption of the original schedule or rate, either by stating explicitly when the higher payment or charges resume, or by indicating the duration of the skip option. Language such as ``You may skip your October payment,'' or ``We will waive your finance charges for January,'' may serve as the change-in-terms notice.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(iii) Notice to restrict credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Written request for reinstatement. If a creditor requires the request for reinstatement of credit privileges to be in writing, the notice under Sec. 226.9(c)(1)(iii) must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice not required. A creditor need not provide a notice under this paragraph if, pursuant to the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(f)(2), a creditor freezes a line or reduces a credit line rather than terminating a plan and accelerating the balance.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2) Rules affecting open-end (not home-secured) plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes initially disclosed. Except as provided in Sec. 226.9(g)(1), no notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially consistent with any applicable requirements, such as rate or fee increases upon expiration of a specific period of time that were disclosed in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or rate increases under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(C). In contrast, notice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to increase a rate or fee at its discretion.</p><p class="depth0">2. State law issues. Some issues are not addressed by Sec. 226.9(c)(2) because they are controlled by state or other applicable laws. These issues include the types of changes a creditor may make, to the extent otherwise permitted by this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in billing cycle. Whenever the creditor changes the consumer's billing cycle, it must give a change-in-terms notice if the change affects any of the terms described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(i), unless an exception under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v) applies; for example, the creditor must give advance notice if the creditor initially disclosed a 28-day grace period on purchases and the consumer will have fewer days during the billing cycle change. See also Sec. 226.7(b)(11)(i)(A) regarding the general requirement that the payment due date for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan must be the same day each month.</p><p class="depth0">4. Relationship to Sec. 226.9(b). If a creditor adds a feature to the account on the type of terms otherwise required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6, the creditor must satisfy: The requirement to provide the finance charge disclosures for the added feature under Sec. 226.9(b); and any applicable requirement to provide a change-in-terms notice under Sec. 226.9(c), including any advance notice that must be provided. For example, if a creditor adds a balance transfer feature to an account more than 30 days after account-opening disclosures are provided, it must give the finance charge disclosures for the balance transfer feature under Sec. 226.9(b) as well as comply with the change-in-terms notice requirements under Sec. 226.9(c), including providing notice of the change at least 45 days prior to the effective date of the change. Similarly, if a creditor makes a balance transfer offer on finance charge terms that are higher than those previously disclosed for balance transfers, it would also generally be required to provide a change-in-terms notice at least 45 days in advance of the effective date of the change. A creditor may provide a single notice under Sec. 226.9(c) to satisfy the notice requirements of both paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 226.9. For checks that access a credit card account subject to the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.9(b)(3), a creditor is not subject to the notice requirements under Sec. 226.9(c) even if the applicable rate or fee is higher than those previously disclosed for such checks. Thus, for example, the creditor need not wait 45 days before applying the new rate or fee for transactions made using such checks, but the creditor must make the required disclosures on or with the checks in accordance with Sec. 226.9(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(i) Changes where written advance notice is required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Affected consumers. Change-in-terms notices need only go to those consumers who may be affected by the change. For example, a change in the periodic rate for check overdraft credit need not be disclosed to consumers who do not have that feature on their accounts. If a single credit account involves multiple consumers that may be affected by the change, the creditor should refer to Sec. 226.5(d) to determine the number of notices that must be given.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing--effective date of change. The rule that the notice of the change in terms be provided at least 45 days before the change takes effect permits mid-cycle changes when

there is clearly no retroactive effect, such as the imposition of a transaction fee. Any change in the balance computation method, in contrast, would need to be disclosed at least 45 days prior to the billing cycle in which the change is to be implemented.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes agreed to by the consumer. See also comment 5(b)(1)(i)-6.</p><p class="depth0">4. Form of change-in-terms notice. Except if Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) applies, a complete new set of the initial disclosures containing the changed term complies with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(i) if the change is highlighted on the disclosure statement, or if the disclosure statement is accompanied by a letter or some other insert that indicates or draws attention to the term being changed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Security interest change--form of notice. A creditor must provide a description of any security interest it is acquiring under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv). A copy of the security agreement that describes the collateral securing the consumer's account may also be used as the notice, when the term change is the addition of a security interest or the addition or substitution of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples. See comment 55(a)-1 and 55(b)-3 for examples of how a card issuer that is subject to Sec. 226.55 may comply with the timing requirements for notices required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(iii) Charges not covered by Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. Generally, if a creditor increases any component of a charge, or introduces a new charge, that is imposed as part of the plan under Sec. 226.6(b)(3) but is not required to be disclosed as part of the account-opening summary table under Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2), the creditor must either, at its option (i) provide at least 45 days' written advance notice before the change becomes effective to comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(i), or (ii) provide notice orally or in writing, or electronically if the consumer requests the service electronically, of the amount of the charge to an affected consumer before the consumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge, at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice the disclosure. (See the commentary under Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(iii) regarding disclosure of such changes in electronic form.) For example, a fee for expedited delivery of a credit card is a charge imposed as part of the plan under Sec. 226.6(b)(3) but is not required to be disclosed in the account-opening summary table under Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2). If a creditor changes the amount of that expedited delivery fee, the creditor may provide written advance notice of the change to affected consumers at least 45 days before the change becomes effective. Alternatively, the creditor may provide oral or written notice, or electronic notice if the consumer requests the service electronically, of the amount of the charge to an affected consumer before the consumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge, at a time and in a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice the disclosure. (See comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1 for examples of disclosures given at a time and in a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice them.)</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(iv) Disclosure requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing margin for calculating a variable rate. If a creditor is changing a margin used to calculate a variable rate, the creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new margin) in the table described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv), and include a reminder that the rate is a variable rate. For example, if a creditor is changing the margin for a variable rate that uses the prime rate as an index, the creditor must disclose in the table the new rate (as calculated using the new margin) and indicate that the rate varies with the market based on the prime rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changing index for calculating a variable rate. If a creditor is changing the index used to calculate a variable rate, the creditor must disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new index) and indicate that the rate varies and how the rate is determined, as explained in Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(i)(A). For example, if a creditor is changing from using a prime rate to using the LIBOR in calculating a variable rate, the creditor would disclose in the table the new rate (using the new index) and indicate that the rate varies with the market based on the LIBOR.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. If a creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's account from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, the creditor generally must provide a notice as otherwise required under Sec. 226.9(c) even if the variable rate at the time of the change is higher than the non-variable rate. However, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 226.9(c) if the creditor provides the disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) in connection with changing a variable rate to a lower non-variable rate. Similarly, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 226.9(c) when changing a variable rate to a lower non-variable rate in order to comply with 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation. Finally, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 226.9(c) when changing a variable rate to a lower non-variable rate in order to comply with Sec. 226.55(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. If a creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's account from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, the creditor generally must provide a notice as otherwise required under Sec. 226.9(c) even if the non-variable rate is higher than the variable rate at the time of the change. However, a creditor is not required to provide a notice

under Sec. 226.9(c) if the creditor provides the disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) in connection with changing a non-variable rate to a lower variable rate. Similarly, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 226.9(c) when changing a non-variable rate to a lower variable rate in order to comply with 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation. Finally, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 226.9(c) when changing a non-variable rate to a lower variable rate in order to comply with Sec. 226.55(b)(4). See comment 55(b)(2)-4 regarding the limitations in Sec. 226.55(b)(2) on changing the rate that applies to a protected balance from a non-variable rate to a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0">5. Changes in the penalty rate, the triggers for the penalty rate, or how long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is changing the amount of the penalty rate, the creditor must also redisclose the triggers for the penalty rate and the information about how long the penalty rate applies even if those terms are not changing. Likewise, if a creditor is changing the triggers for the penalty rate, the creditor must redisclose the amount of the penalty rate and information about how long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is changing how long the penalty rate applies, the creditor must redisclose the amount of the penalty rate and the triggers for the penalty rate, even if they are not changing.</p><p class="depth0">6. Changes in fees. If a creditor is changing part of how a fee that is disclosed in a tabular format under Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2) is determined, the creditor must redisclose all relevant information related to that fee regardless of whether this other information is changing. For example, if a creditor currently charges a cash advance fee of ``Either $5 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater. (Max: $100),'' and the creditor is only changing the minimum dollar amount from $5 to $10, the issuer must redisclose the other information related to how the fee is determined. For example, the creditor in this example would disclose the following: ``Either $10 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater. (Max: $100).''</p><p class="depth0">7. Combining a notice described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) with a notice described in Sec. 226.9(g)(3). If a creditor is required to provide a notice described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) and a notice described in Sec. 226.9(g)(3) to a consumer, the creditor may combine the two notices. This would occur if penalty pricing has been triggered, and other terms are changing on the consumer's account at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">8. Content. Sample G-20 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) when a variable rate is being changed to a non-variable rate on a credit card account. The sample explains when the new rate will apply to new transactions and to which balances the current rate will continue to apply. Sample G-21 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) when the late payment fee on a credit card account is being increased, and the returned payment fee is also being increased. The sample discloses the consumer's right to reject the changes in accordance with Sec. 226.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">9. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(1).</p><p class="depth0">10. Terminology. See Sec. 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(1).</p><p class="depth0">11. Reasons for increase. i. In general. Section 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) requires card issuers to disclose the principal reason(s) for increasing an annual percentage rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The regulation does not mandate a minimum number of reasons that must be disclosed. However, the specific reasons disclosed under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) are required to relate to and accurately describe the principal factors actually considered by the card issuer in increasing the rate. A card issuer may describe the reasons for the increase in general terms. For example, the notice of a rate increase triggered by a decrease of 100 points in a consumer's credit score may state that the increase is due to ``a decline in your creditworthiness'' or ``a decline in your credit score.'' Similarly, a notice of a rate increase triggered by a 10% increase in the card issuer's cost of funds may be disclosed as ``a change in market conditions.'' In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for a card issuer to combine the disclosure of several reasons in one statement. However, Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) requires that the notice specifically disclose any violation of the terms of the account on which the rate is being increased, such as a late payment or a returned payment, if such violation of the account terms is one of the four principal reasons for the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that a consumer made a late payment on the credit card account on which the rate increase is being imposed, made a late payment on a credit card account with another card issuer, and the consumer's credit score decreased, in part due to such late payments. The card issuer may disclose the reasons for the rate increase as a decline in the consumer's credit score and the consumer's late payment on the account subject to the increase. Because the late payment on the credit card account with the other issuer also likely contributed to the decline in the consumer's credit score, it is not required to be separately disclosed. However, the late payment on the credit card account on which the rate increase is being imposed must be specifically disclosed even if that late payment also contributed to the decline in the consumer's credit score.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(v) Notice not required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes not requiring notice. The following are examples of changes that do not require a change-in-terms notice</p><p class="depth0">i. A change in the consumer's credit limit except as otherwise required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A change in the name of the credit card or credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The substitution of one insurer for another.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A termination or suspension of credit privileges.</p><p class="depth0">v. Changes arising merely by operation of law; for example, if the creditor's security interest in a consumer's car automatically extends to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car.</p><p class="depth0">2. Skip features. i. Skipped or reduced payments. If a credit program allows consumers to skip or reduce one or more payments during the year, no notice of the change in terms is required either prior to the reduction in payments or upon resumption of the higher payments if these features are explained on the account-opening disclosure statement (including an explanation of the terms upon resumption). For example, a merchant may allow consumers to skip the December payment to encourage holiday shopping, or a teacher's credit union may not require payments during summer vacation. Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior to resuming the original payment schedule, even though no notice is required prior to the reduction. The change-in-terms notice may be combined with the notice offering the reduction. For example, the periodic statement reflecting the skip feature may also be used to notify the consumer of the resumption of the original payment schedule, either by stating explicitly when the higher resumes or by indicating the duration of the skip option. Language such as ``You may skip your October payment'' may serve as the change-in-terms notice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Temporary reductions in interest rates or fees. If a credit program involves temporary reductions in an interest rate or fee, no notice of the change in terms is required either prior to the reduction or upon resumption of the original rate or fee if these features are disclosed in advance in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B). Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior to resuming the original rate or fee, even though no notice is required prior to the reduction. The notice provided prior to resuming the original rate or fee must comply with the timing requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(i) and the content and format requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(A), (B) (if applicable), (C) (if applicable), and (D). See comment 55(b)-3 for guidance regarding the application of Sec. 226.55 in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. See comment 9(c)(2)(iv)-3.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. See comment 9(c)(2)(iv)-4.</p><p class="depth0">5. Temporary rate or fee reductions offered by telephone. The timing requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) are deemed to have been met, and written disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) may be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the first transaction subject to a rate that will be in effect for a specified period of time (a temporary rate) or the imposition of a fee that will be in effect for a specified period of time (a temporary fee) if</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer accepts the offer of the temporary rate or temporary fee by telephone;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor permits the consumer to reject the temporary rate or temporary fee offer and have the rate or rates or fee that previously applied to the consumer's balances reinstated for 45 days after the creditor mails or delivers the written disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), except that the creditor need not permit the consumer to reject a temporary rate or temporary fee offer if the rate or rates or fee that will apply following expiration of the temporary rate do not exceed the rate or rates or fee that applied immediately prior to commencement of the temporary rate or temporary fee; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. The disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and the consumer's right to reject the temporary rate or temporary fee offer and have the rate or rates or fee that previously applied to the consumer's account reinstated, if applicable, are disclosed to the consumer as part of the temporary rate or temporary fee offer.</p><p class="depth0">6. First listing. The disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) are only required to be provided in close proximity and in equal prominence to the first listing of the temporary rate or fee in the disclosure provided to the consumer. For purposes of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), the first statement of the temporary rate or fee is the most prominent listing on the front side of the first page of the disclosure. If the temporary rate or fee does not appear on the front side of the first page of the disclosure, then the first listing of the temporary rate or fee is the most prominent listing of the temporary rate on the subsequent pages of the disclosure. For advertising requirements for promotional rates, see Sec. 226.16(g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Close proximity--point of sale. Creditors providing the disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) of this section in person in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services may, at the creditor's option, disclose the annual percentage rate or fee that would apply after expiration of the period on a separate page or document from the temporary rate or fee and the length of the period, provided that the disclosure of the annual percentage rate or fee that would apply after the expiration of the period is

equally prominent to, and is provided at the same time as, the disclosure of the temporary rate or fee and length of the period.</p><p class="depth0">8. Disclosure of annual percentage rates. If a rate disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) is a variable rate, the creditor must disclose the fact that the rate may vary and how the rate is determined. For example, a creditor could state ``After October 1, 2009, your APR will be 14.99%. This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">9. Deferred interest or similar programs. If the applicable conditions are met, the exception in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) applies to deferred interest or similar promotional programs under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. For purposes of this comment and Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), ``deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. For such programs, a creditor must disclose pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) the length of the deferred interest period and the rate that will apply to the balance subject to the deferred interest program if that balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the deferred interest period. Examples of language that a creditor may use to make the required disclosures under Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) include</p><p class="depth0">i. ``No interest if paid in full in 6 months. If the balance is not paid in full in 6 months, interest will be imposed from the date of purchase at a rate of 15.99%.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``No interest if paid in full by December 31, 2010. If the balance is not paid in full by that date, interest will be imposed from the transaction date at a rate of 15%.''</p><p class="depth0">10. Relationship between Sec. Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and 226.6(b). A disclosure of the information described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) provided in the account-opening table in accordance with Sec. 226.6(b) complies with the requirements of Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(2), if the listing of the introductory rate in such tabular disclosure also is the first listing as described in comment 9(c)(2)(v)-6.</p><p class="depth0">11. Disclosure of the terms of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. In order for the exception in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D) to apply, the disclosure provided to the consumer pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D)(2) must set forth</p><p class="depth0">i. The annual percentage rate that will apply to balances subject to the workout or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The annual percentage rate that will apply to such balances if the consumer completes or fails to comply with the terms of, the workout or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Any reduced fee or charge of a type required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(viii), (b)(2)(ix), (b)(2)(xi), or (b)(2)(xii) that will apply to balances subject to the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, as well as the fee or charge that will apply if the consumer completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Any reduced minimum periodic payment that will apply to balances subject to the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, as well as the minimum periodic payment that will apply if the consumer completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement; and</p><p class="depth0">v. If applicable, that the consumer must make timely minimum payments in order to remain eligible for the workout or temporary hardship arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">12. Index not under creditor's control. See comment 55(b)(2)-2 for guidance on when an index is deemed to be under a creditor's control.</p><p class="depth0">13. Temporary rates--relationship to Sec. 226.59. i. General. Section 226.59 requires a card issuer to review rate increases imposed due to the revocation of a temporary rate. In some circumstances, Sec. 226.59 may require an issuer to reinstate a reduced temporary rate based on that review. If, based on a review required by Sec. 226.59, a creditor reinstates a temporary rate that had been revoked, the card issuer is not required to provide an additional notice to the consumer when the reinstated temporary rate expires, if the card issuer provided the disclosures required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) prior to the original commencement of the temporary rate. See Sec. 226.55 and the associated commentary for guidance on the permissibility and applicability of rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. A consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on January 1, 2011. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 18%. The card issuer offers the consumer a 15% rate on purchases made between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2014. Prior to January 1, 2012, the card issuer discloses, in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), that the rate on purchases made during that period will increase to the standard 18% rate on January 1, 2014. In March 2012, the consumer makes a payment that is ten days late. The card issuer, upon providing 45 days' advance notice of the change under Sec. 226.9(g), increases the rate on new purchases to 18% effective as of June 1, 2012. On December 1, 2012, the issuer performs a review of the consumer's account in accordance with Sec. 226.59. Based on that review, the card issuer is required to reduce the rate to the original 15% temporary rate as of January 15, 2013. On January 1, 2014, the card issuer may increase the rate on purchases to 18%, as previously disclosed prior to January 1, 2012, without providing an additional notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">9(d) Finance charge imposed at time of transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure prior to imposition. A person imposing a finance charge at the time of honoring a consumer's credit card must disclose the amount of the charge, or an explanation of how the charge will be determined, prior to its imposition. This must be disclosed before the consumer becomes obligated for property or services that may be paid for by use of a credit card. For example, disclosure must be given before the consumer has dinner at a restaurant, stays overnight at a hotel, or makes a deposit guaranteeing the purchase of property or services.</p><p class="depth0">9(e) Disclosures upon renewal of credit or charge card.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This paragraph applies to credit and charge card accounts of the type subject to Sec. 226.5a. (See Sec. 226.5a(a)(5) and the accompanying commentary for discussion of the types of accounts subject to Sec. 226.5a.) The disclosure requirements are triggered when a card issuer imposes any annual or other periodic fee on such an account or if the card issuer has changed or amended any term of a cardholder's account required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2) that has not previously been disclosed to the consumer, whether or not the card issuer originally was required to provide the application and solicitation disclosures described in Sec. 226.5a.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form. The disclosures under this paragraph must be clear and conspicuous, but need not appear in a tabular format or in a prominent location. The disclosures need not be in a form the cardholder can retain.</p><p class="depth0">3. Terms at renewal. Renewal notices must reflect the terms actually in effect at the time of renewal. For example, a card issuer that offers a preferential annual percentage rate to employees during their employment must send a renewal notice to employees disclosing the lower rate actually charged to employees (although the card issuer also may show the rate charged to the general public).</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable rate. If the card issuer cannot determine the rate that will be in effect if the cardholder chooses to renew a variable-rate account, the card issuer may disclose the rate in effect at the time of mailing or delivery of the renewal notice. Alternatively, the card issuer may use the rate as of a specified date within the last 30 days before the disclosure is provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Renewals more frequent than annual. If a renewal fee is billed more often than annually, the renewal notice should be provided each time the fee is billed. In this instance, the fee need not be disclosed as an annualized amount. Alternatively, the card issuer may provide the notice no less than once every 12 months if the notice explains the amount and frequency of the fee that will be billed during the time period covered by the disclosure, and also discloses the fee as an annualized amount. The notice under this alternative also must state the consequences of a cardholder's decision to terminate the account after the renewal-notice period has expired. For example, if a $2 fee is billed monthly but the notice is given annually, the notice must inform the cardholder that the monthly charge is $2, the annualized fee is $24, and $2 will be billed to the account each month for the coming year unless the cardholder notifies the card issuer. If the cardholder is obligated to pay an amount equal to the remaining unpaid monthly charges if the cardholder terminates the account during the coming year but after the first month, the notice must disclose the fact.</p><p class="depth0">6. Terminating credit availability. Card issuers have some flexibility in determining the procedures for how and when an account may be terminated. However, the card issuer must clearly disclose the time by which the cardholder must act to terminate the account to avoid paying a renewal fee, if applicable. State and other applicable law govern whether the card issuer may impose requirements such as specifying that the cardholder's response be in writing or that the outstanding balance be repaid in full upon termination.</p><p class="depth0">7. Timing of termination by cardholder. When a card issuer provides notice under Sec. 226.9(e)(1), a cardholder must be given at least 30 days or one billing cycle, whichever is less, from the date the notice is mailed or delivered to make a decision whether to terminate an account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Timing of notices. A renewal notice is deemed to be provided when mailed or delivered. Similarly, notice of termination is deemed to be given when mailed or delivered.</p><p class="depth0">9. Prompt reversal of renewal fee upon termination. In a situation where a cardholder has provided timely notice of termination and a renewal fee has been billed to a cardholder's account, the card issuer must reverse or otherwise withdraw the fee promptly. Once a cardholder has terminated an account, no additional action by the cardholder may be required.</p><p class="depth0">10. Disclosure of changes in terms required to be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (b)(2). Clear and conspicuous disclosure of a changed term on a periodic statement provided to a consumer prior to renewal of the consumer's account constitutes prior disclosure of that term for purposes of Sec. 226.9(e)(1). Card issuers should refer to Sec. 226.9(c)(2) for additional timing, content, and formatting requirements that apply to certain changes in terms under that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">9(e)(2) Notification on periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Combined disclosures. If a single disclosure is used to comply with both Sec. Sec. 226.9(e) and 226.7, the periodic statement must comply with the rules in Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.7. For example, a description substantially similar to the heading describing the grace period required by Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) must be used and

the name of the balance-calculation method must be identified (if listed in Sec. 226.5a(g)) to comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.5a. A card issuer may include some of the renewal disclosures on a periodic statement and others on a separate document so long as there is some reference indicating that the disclosures relate to one another. All renewal disclosures must be provided to a cardholder at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">2. Preprinted notices on periodic statements. A card issuer may preprint the required information on its periodic statements. A card issuer that does so, however, must make clear on the periodic statement when the preprinted renewal disclosures are applicable. For example, the card issuer could include a special notice (not preprinted) at the appropriate time that the renewal fee will be billed in the following billing cycle, or could show the renewal date as a regular (preprinted) entry on all periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">9(f) Change in credit card account insurance provider.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This paragraph applies to credit card accounts of the type subject to Sec. 226.5a if credit insurance (typically life, disability, and unemployment insurance) is offered on the outstanding balance of such an account. (Credit card accounts subject to Sec. 226.9(f) are the same as those subject to Sec. 226.9(e); see comment 9(e)-1.) Charge card accounts are not covered by this paragraph. In addition, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply only where the card issuer initiates the change in insurance provider. For example, if the card issuer's current insurance provider is merged into or acquired by another company, these disclosures would not be required. Disclosures also need not be given in cases where card issuers pay for credit insurance themselves and do not separately charge the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">2. No increase in rate or decrease in coverage. The requirement to provide the disclosure arises when the card issuer changes the provider of insurance, even if there will be no increase in the premium rate charged to the consumer and no decrease in coverage under the insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of notice. If a substantial decrease in coverage will result from the change in provider, the card issuer either must explain the decrease or refer to an accompanying copy of the policy or group certificate for details of the new terms of coverage. (See the commentary to appendix G-13 to part 226.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Discontinuation of insurance. In addition to stating that the cardholder may cancel the insurance, the card issuer may explain the effect the cancellation would have on the consumer's credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">5. Mailing by third party. Although the card issuer is responsible for the disclosures, the insurance provider or another third party may furnish the disclosures on the card issuer's behalf.</p><p class="depth0">9(f)(3) Substantial decrease in coverage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination. Whether a substantial decrease in coverage will result from the change in provider is determined by the two-part test in Sec. 226.9(f)(3): First, whether the decrease is in a significant term of coverage; and second, whether the decrease might reasonably be expected to affect a cardholder's decision to continue the insurance. If both conditions are met, the decrease must be disclosed in the notice.</p><p class="depth0">9(g) Increase in rates due to delinquency or default or as a penalty.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship between Sec. 226.9(c) and (g) and Sec. 226.55--examples. Card issuers subject to Sec. 226.55 are prohibited from increasing the annual percentage rate for a category of transactions on any consumer credit card account unless specifically permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). See comments 55(a)-1 and 55(b)-3 and the commentary to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) for examples that illustrate the relationship between the notice requirements of Sec. 226.9(c) and (g) and Sec. 226.55.</p><p class="depth0">2. Affected consumers. If a single credit account involves multiple consumers that may be affected by the change, the creditor should refer to Sec. 226.5(d) to determine the number of notices that must be given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Combining a notice described in Sec. 226.9(g)(3) with a notice described in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv). If a creditor is required to provide notices pursuant to both Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv) and (g)(3) to a consumer, the creditor may combine the two notices. This would occur when penalty pricing has been triggered, and other terms are changing on the consumer's account at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">4. Content. Sample G-22 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(i) when the rate on a consumer's credit card account is being increased to a penalty rate as described in Sec. 226.9(g)(1)(ii), based on a late payment that is not more than 60 days late. Sample G-23 contains an example of how to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(i) when the rate increase is triggered by a delinquency of more than 60 days.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the clear and conspicuous standard applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(g).</p><p class="depth0">6. Terminology. See Sec. 226.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Reasons for increase. See comment 9(c)(2)(iv)-11 for guidance on disclosure of the reasons for a rate increase for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">9(g)(4) Exception for decrease in credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">1. The following illustrates the requirements of Sec. 226.9(g)(4). Assume that a creditor decreased the credit limit applicable to a

consumer's account and sent a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(g)(4) on January 1, stating among other things that the penalty rate would apply if the consumer's balance exceeded the new credit limit as of February 16. If the consumer's balance exceeded the credit limit on February 16, the creditor could impose the penalty rate on that date. However, a creditor could not apply the penalty rate if the consumer's balance did not exceed the new credit limit on February 16, even if the consumer's balance had exceeded the new credit limit on several dates between January 1 and February 15. If the consumer's balance did not exceed the new credit limit on February 16 but the consumer conducted a transaction on February 17 that caused the balance to exceed the new credit limit, the general rule in Sec. 226.9(g)(1)(ii) would apply and the creditor would be required to give an additional 45 days' notice prior to imposition of the penalty rate (but under these circumstances the consumer would have no ability to cure the over-the-limit balance in order to avoid penalty pricing).</p><p class="depth0">9(h) Consumer rejection of certain significant changes in terms.</p><p class="depth0">1. Circumstances in which Sec. 226.9(h) does not apply. Section 226.9(h) applies when Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) requires disclosure of the consumer's right to reject a significant change to an account term. Thus, for example, Sec. 226.9(h) does not apply to changes to the terms of home equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b that are accessible by a credit or charge card because Sec. 226.9(c)(2) does not apply to such plans. Similarly, Sec. 226.9(h) does not apply in the following circumstances because Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require disclosure of the right to reject in those circumstances: (i) An increase in the required minimum periodic payment; (ii) a change in an annual percentage rate applicable to a consumer's account (such as changing the margin or index for calculating a variable rate, changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, or changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate); (iii) a change in the balance computation method necessary to comply with Sec. 226.54; and (iv) when the change results from the creditor not receiving the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment.</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(1) Right to reject.</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable requirements for submission of rejections. A creditor may establish reasonable requirements for the submission of rejections pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h)(1). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that rejections be made by the primary account holder and that the consumer identify the account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that rejections be made only using the toll-free telephone number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c). It would also be reasonable for a creditor to designate additional channels for the submission of rejections (such as an address for rejections submitted by mail) so long as the creditor does not require that rejections be submitted through such additional channels.</p><p class="depth0">iii. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that rejections be received before the effective date disclosed pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) and to treat the account as not subject to Sec. 226.9(h) if a rejection is received on or after that date. It would not, however, be reasonable to require that rejections be submitted earlier than the day before the effective date. If a creditor is unable to process all rejections received before the effective date, the creditor may delay implementation of the change in terms until all rejections have been processed. In the alternative, the creditor could implement the change on the effective date and then, on any account for which a timely rejection was received, reverse the change and remove or credit any interest charges or fees imposed as a result of the change. For example, if the effective date for a change in terms is June 15 and the creditor cannot process all rejections received by telephone on June 14 until June 16, the creditor may delay imposition of the change until June 17. Alternatively, the creditor could implement the change for all affected accounts on June 15 and then, once all rejections have been processed, return any account for which a timely rejection was received to the prior terms and ensure that the account is not assessed any additional interest or fees as a result of the change or that the account is credited for such interest or fees.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of account following provision of notice. A consumer does not waive or forfeit the right to reject a significant change in terms by using the account for transactions prior to the effective date of the change. Similarly, a consumer does not revoke a rejection by using the account for transactions after the rejection is received.</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(2)(ii) Prohibition on penalties.</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination or suspension of credit availability. Section 226.9(h)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a creditor from terminating or suspending credit availability as a result of the consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Solely as a result of rejection. A creditor is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge or treating an account as in default solely as a result of the consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms. For example, if credit availability is terminated or suspended as a result of the consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms, a creditor is prohibited from imposing a periodic

fee that was not charged before the consumer rejected the change (such as a closed account fee). See also comment 55(d)-1. However, regardless of whether credit availability is terminated or suspended as a result of the consumer's rejection, a creditor is not prohibited from continuing to charge a periodic fee that was charged before the rejection. Similarly, a creditor that charged a fee for late payment before a change was rejected is not prohibited from charging that fee after rejection of the change.</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(2)(iii) Repayment of outstanding balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relevant date for repayment methods. Once a consumer has rejected a significant change in terms, Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii) prohibits the creditor from requiring repayment of the balance on the account using a method that is less beneficial to the consumer than one of the methods listed in Sec. 226.55(c)(2). When applying the methods listed in Sec. 226.55(c)(2) pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii), a creditor may utilize the date on which the creditor was notified of the rejection or a later date (such as the date on which the change would have gone into effect but for the rejection). For example, assume that on April 16 a creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the monthly maintenance fee for the account will increase effective June 1. The notice also states that the consumer may reject the increase by calling a specified toll-free telephone number before June 1 but that, if the consumer does so, credit availability for the account will be terminated. On May 5, the consumer calls the toll-free number and exercises the right to reject. If the creditor chooses to establish a five-year amortization period for the balance on the account consistent with Sec. 226.55(c)(2)(ii), that period may begin no earlier than the date on which the creditor was notified of the rejection (May 5). However, the creditor may also begin the amortization period on the date on which the change would have gone into effect but for the rejection (June 1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Balance on the account.</p><p class="depth0">i. In general. When applying the methods listed in Sec. 226.55(c)(2) pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii), the provisions in Sec. 226.55(c)(2) and the guidance in the commentary to Sec. 226.55(c)(2) regarding protected balances also apply to a balance on the account subject to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii). If a creditor terminates or suspends credit availability based on a consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms, the balance on the account that is subject to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of the day on which credit availability is terminated or suspended. However, if a creditor does not terminate or suspend credit availability based on the consumer's rejection, the balance on the account subject to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of the day on which the creditor was notified of the rejection or, at the creditor's option, a later date.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that on June 16 a creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the annual fee for the account will increase effective August 1. The notice also states that the consumer may reject the increase by calling a specified toll-free telephone number before August 1 but that, if the consumer does so, credit availability for the account will be terminated. On July 20, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000 and the consumer calls the toll-free number and exercises the right to reject. On July 22, a $200 purchase is charged to the account. If the creditor terminates credit availability on July 25 as a result of the rejection, the balance subject to the repayment limitations in Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii) is the $1,200 purchase balance at the end of the day on July 25. However, if the creditor does not terminate credit availability as a result of the rejection, the balance subject to the repayment limitations in Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii) is the $1,000 purchase balance at the end of the day on the date the creditor was notified of the rejection (July 20), although the creditor may, at its option, treat the $200 purchase as part of the balance subject to Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(3) Exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Section 226.9(h)(3) provides that Sec. 226.9(h) does not apply when the creditor has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment. The following examples illustrate the application of this exception:</p><p class="depth0">i. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent before notice provided. Assume that a credit card account is opened on January 1 of year one and that the payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the month. On June 20 of year two, the creditor has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on April 15, May 15, and June 15. On June 20, the creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that a monthly maintenance fee of $10 will be charged beginning on August 4. However, Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require the creditor to notify the consumer of the right to reject because the creditor has not received the April 15 minimum payment within 60 days after the due date. Furthermore, the exception in Sec. 226.9(h)(3) applies and the consumer may not reject the fee.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent after rejection. Assume that a credit card account is opened on January 1 of year one and that the payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the month. On April 20 of year two, the creditor has not received the required minimum periodic payment due on April 15. On April 20, the creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that an annual fee

of $100 will be charged beginning on June 4. The notice further states that the consumer may reject the fee by calling a specified toll-free telephone number before June 4 but that, if the consumer does so, credit availability for the account will be terminated. On May 5, the consumer calls the toll-free telephone number and rejects the fee. Section 226.9(h)(2)(i) prohibits the creditor from charging the $100 fee to the account. If, however, the creditor does not receive the minimum payments due on April 15 and May 15 by June 15, Sec. 226.9(h)(3) permits the creditor to charge the $100 fee. The creditor must provide a second notice of the fee pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c), but Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require the creditor to disclose the right to reject and Sec. 226.9(h)(3) does not allow the consumer to reject the fee. Similarly, the restrictions in Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) no longer apply.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.10--Payments</p><p class="depth0">10(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting date. Section 226.10(a) does not require the creditor to post the payment to the consumer's account on a particular date; the creditor is only required to credit the payment as of the date of receipt.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date of receipt. The ``date of receipt'' is the date that the payment instrument or other means of completing the payment reaches the creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Payment by check is received when the creditor gets it, not when the funds are collected.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to an asset account held by the creditor, and from which payments are made periodically to an open-end credit account, payment is received on the date when it is debited to the asset account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer elects to have payment made by a third party payor such as a financial institution, through a preauthorized payment or telephone bill-payment arrangement, payment is received when the creditor gets the third party payor's check or other transfer medium, such as an electronic fund transfer, as long as the payment meets the creditor's requirements as specified under Sec. 226.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Payment made via the creditor's Web site is received on the date on which the consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment, even if the consumer gives the instruction authorizing that payment in advance of the date on which the creditor is authorized to effect the payment. If the consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment immediately, but the consumer's instruction is received after 5 p.m. or any later cut-off time specified by the creditor, the date on which the consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment is deemed to be the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">10(b) Specific requirements for payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment by electronic fund transfer. A creditor may be prohibited from specifying payment by preauthorized electronic fund transfer. (See section 913 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment methods promoted by creditor. If a creditor promotes a specific payment method, any payments made via that method (prior to any cut-off time specified by the creditor, to the extent permitted by Sec. 226.10(b)(2)) are generally conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b). For example</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor promotes electronic payment via its Web site (such as by disclosing on the Web site itself that payments may be made via the Web site), any payments made via the creditor's Web site prior to the creditor's specified cut-off time, if any, would generally be conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a creditor promotes payment by telephone (for example, by including the option to pay by telephone in a menu of options provided to consumers at a toll-free number disclosed on its periodic statement), payments made by telephone would generally be conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iii. If a creditor promotes in-person payments, for example by stating in an advertisement that payments may be made in person at its branch locations, such in-person payments made at a branch or office of the creditor generally would be conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iv. If a creditor promotes that payments may be made through an unaffiliated third party, such as by disclosing the Web site address of that third party on the periodic statement, payments made via that third party's Web site generally would be conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b). In contrast, if a customer service representative of the creditor confirms to a consumer that payments may be made via an unaffiliated third party, but the creditor does not otherwise promote that method of payment, Sec. 226.10(b) permits the creditor to treat payments made via such third party as nonconforming payments in accordance with Sec. 226.10(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">3. Acceptance of nonconforming payments. If the creditor accepts a nonconforming payment (for example, payment mailed to a branch office, when the creditor had specified that payment be sent to a different location), finance charges may accrue for the period between receipt and crediting of payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Implied guidelines for payments. In the absence of specified requirements for making payments (see Sec. 226.10(b)):</p><p class="depth0">i. Payments may be made at any location where the creditor conducts business.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments may be made any time during the creditor's normal business hours.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Payment may be by cash, money order, draft, or other similar instrument in properly negotiable form, or by electronic fund transfer if the creditor and consumer have so agreed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payments made at point of sale. If a card issuer that is a financial institution issues a credit card under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that can be used only for transactions with a particular merchant or merchants or a credit card that is cobranded with the name of a particular merchant or merchants, and a consumer is able to make a payment on that credit card account at a retail location maintained by such a merchant, that retail location is not considered to be a branch or office of the card issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">6. In-person payments on credit card accounts. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(b)(3), payments made in person at a branch or office of a financial institution include payments made with the direct assistance of, or to, a branch or office employee, for example a teller at a bank branch. A payment made at the bank branch without the direct assistance of a branch or office employee, for example a payment placed in a branch or office mail slot, is not a payment made in person for purposes of Sec. 226.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">7. In-person payments at affiliate of card issuer. If an affiliate of a card issuer that is a financial institution shares a name with the card issuer, such as ``ABC,'' and accepts in-person payments on the card issuer's credit card accounts, those payments are subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">10(d) Crediting of payments when creditor does not receive or accept payments on due date.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. A day on which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail may occur, for example, if the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver mail on that date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Treating a payment as late for any purpose. See comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-2 for guidance on treating a payment as late for any purpose. When an account is not eligible for a grace period, imposing a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate does not constitute treating a payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">10(e) Limitations on fees related to method of payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Separate fee to allow consumers to make a payment. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(e), the term ``separate fee'' means a fee imposed on a consumer for making a payment to the consumer's account. A fee or other charge imposed if payment is made after the due date, such as a late fee or finance charge, is not a separate fee to allow consumers to make a payment for purposes of Sec. 226.10(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. Expedited. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(e), the term ``expedited'' means crediting a payment the same day or, if the payment is received after any cut-off time established by the creditor, the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">3. Service by a customer service representative. Service by a customer service representative of a creditor means any payment made to the consumer's account with the assistance of a live representative or agent of the creditor, including those made in person, on the telephone, or by electronic means. A customer service representative does not include automated means of making payment that do not involve a live representative or agent of the creditor, such as a voice response unit or interactive voice response system. Service by a customer service representative includes any payment transaction which involves the assistance of a live representative or agent of the creditor, even if an automated system is required for a portion of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(e), the term ``creditor'' includes a third party that collects, receives, or processes payments on behalf of a creditor. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a creditor uses a service provider to receive, collect, or process on the creditor's behalf payments made through the creditor's Web site or made through an automated telephone payment service. In these circumstances, the service provider would be considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a consumer pays a fee to a money transfer or payment service in order to transmit a payment to the creditor on the consumer's behalf. In these circumstances, the money transfer or payment service would not be considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a consumer has a checking account at a depository institution. The consumer makes a payment to the creditor from the checking account using a bill payment service provided by the depository institution. In these circumstances, the depository institution would not be considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">10(f) Changes by card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Address for receiving payment. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(f), ``address for receiving payment'' means a mailing address for receiving payment, such as a post office box, or the address of a branch or office at which payments on credit card accounts are accepted.</p><p class="depth0">2. Materiality. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(f), a ``material change'' means any change in the address for receiving payment or procedures for handling cardholder payments which causes a material delay in the crediting of a payment. ``Material delay'' means any delay in crediting payment to a consumer's account which would result in a late payment and the imposition of a late fee or finance charge. A delay in crediting a payment

which does not result in a late fee or finance charge would be immaterial.</p><p class="depth0">3. Safe harbor. i. General. A card issuer may elect not to impose a late fee or finance charge on a consumer's account for the 60-day period following a change in address for receiving payment or procedures for handling cardholder payments which could reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in crediting of a payment to the consumer's account. For purposes of Sec. 226.10(f), a late fee or finance charge is not imposed if the fee or charge is waived or removed, or an amount equal to the fee or charge is credited to the account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Retail location. For a material change in the address of a retail location or procedures for handling cardholder payments at a retail location, a card issuer may impose a late fee or finance charge on a consumer's account for a late payment during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect. However, if a card issuer is notified by a consumer no later than 60 days after the card issuer transmitted the first periodic statement that reflects the late fee or finance charge for a late payment that the late payment was caused by such change, the card issuer must waive or remove any late fee or finance charge, or credit an amount equal to any late fee or finance charge, imposed on the account during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect.</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer changes the mailing address for receiving payments by mail from a five-digit postal zip code to a nine-digit postal zip code. A consumer mails a payment using the five-digit postal zip code. The change in mailing address is immaterial and it does not cause a delay. Therefore, a card issuer may impose a late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer changes the mailing address for receiving payments by mail from one post office box number to another post office box number. For a 60-day period following the change, the card issuer continues to use both post office box numbers for the collection of payments received by mail. The change in mailing address would not cause a material delay in crediting a payment because payments would be received and credited at both addresses. Therefore, a card issuer may impose a late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the account during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as paragraph ii. above, except the prior post office box number is no longer valid and mail sent to that address during the 60-day period following the change would be returned to sender. The change in mailing address is material and the change could cause a material delay in the crediting of a payment because a payment sent to the old address could be delayed past the due date. If, as a result, a consumer makes a late payment on the account during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect, a card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge for the late payment.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A card issuer permanently closes a local branch office at which payments are accepted on credit card accounts. The permanent closing of the local branch office is a material change in address for receiving payment. Relying on the safe harbor, the card issuer elects not to impose a late fee or finance charge for the 60-day period following the local branch closing for late payments on consumer accounts which the issuer reasonably determines are associated with the local branch and which could reasonably be expected to have been caused by the branch closing.</p><p class="depth0">v. A consumer has elected to make payments automatically to a credit card account, such as through a payroll deduction plan or a third party payor's preauthorized payment arrangement. A card issuer changes the procedures for handling such payments and as a result, a payment is delayed and not credited to the consumer's account before the due date. In these circumstances, a card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect for a late payment on the account.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A card issuer no longer accepts payments in person at a retail location as a conforming method of payment, which is a material change in the procedures for handling cardholder payment. In the 60-day period following the date on which the change took effect, a consumer attempts to make a payment in person at a retail location of a card issuer. As a result, the consumer makes a late payment and the issuer charges a late fee on the consumer's account. The consumer notifies the card issuer of the late fee for the late payment which was caused by the material change. In order to comply with Sec. 226.10(f), the card issuer must waive or remove the late fee or finance charge, or credit the consumer's account in an amount equal to the late fee or finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">5. Finance charge due to periodic interest rate. When an account is not eligible for a grace period, imposing a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate does not constitute imposition of a finance charge for a late payment for purposes of Sec. 226.10(f).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.11--Treatment of Credit Balances; Account Termination</p><p class="depth0">11(a) Credit balances.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing of refund. The creditor may also fulfill its obligations under Sec. 226.11 by:</p><p class="depth0">i. Refunding any credit balance to the consumer immediately.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Refunding any credit balance prior to receiving a written request (under Sec. 226.11(a)(2)) from the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Refunding any credit balance upon the consumer's oral or electronic request.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Making a good faith effort to refund any credit balance before 6 months have passed. If that attempt is unsuccessful, the creditor need not try again to refund the credit balance at the end of the 6-month period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount of refund. The phrases any part of the remaining credit balance in Sec. 226.11(a)(2) and any part of the credit balance remaining in the account in Sec. 226.11(a)(3) mean the amount of the credit balance at the time the creditor is required to make the refund. The creditor may take into consideration intervening purchases or other debits to the consumer's account (including those that have not yet been reflected on a periodic statement) that decrease or eliminate the credit balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 11(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Written requests--standing orders. The creditor is not required to honor standing orders requesting refunds of any credit balance that may be created on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 11(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Good faith effort to refund. The creditor must take positive steps to return any credit balance that has remained in the account for over 6 months. This includes, if necessary, attempts to trace the consumer through the consumer's last known address or telephone number, or both.</p><p class="depth0">2. Good faith effort unsuccessful. Section 226.11 imposes no further duties on the creditor if a good faith effort to return the balance is unsuccessful. The ultimate disposition of the credit balance (or any credit balance of $1 or less) is to be determined under other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">11(b) Account termination.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 11(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Expiration date. The credit agreement determines whether or not an open-end plan has a stated expiration (maturity) date. Creditors that offer accounts with no stated expiration date are prohibited from terminating those accounts solely because a consumer does not incur a finance charge, even if credit cards or other access devices associated with the account expire after a stated period. Creditors may still terminate such accounts for inactivity consistent with Sec. 226.11(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">11(c) Timely settlement of estate debts</p><p class="depth0">1. Administrator of an estate. For purposes of Sec. 226.11(c), the term ``administrator'' means an administrator, executor, or any personal representative of an estate who is authorized to act on behalf of the estate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. The following are examples of reasonable procedures that satisfy this rule:</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer may decline future transactions and terminate the account upon receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer may credit the account for fees and charges imposed after the date of receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A card issuer may waive the estate's liability for all charges made to the account after receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A card issuer may authorize an agent to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">v. A card issuer may require administrators of an estate to provide documentation indicating authority to act on behalf of the estate.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A card issuer may establish or designate a department, business unit, or communication channel for administrators, such as a specific mailing address or toll-free number, to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">vii. A card issuer may direct administrators, who call a general customer service toll-free number or who send correspondence by mail to an address for general correspondence, to an appropriate customer service representative, department, business unit, or communication channel to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">2. Request by an administrator of an estate. A card issuer may receive a request for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account in writing or by telephone call from the administrator of an estate. If a request is made in writing, such as by mail, the request is received on the date the card issuer receives the correspondence.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timely statement of balance. A card issuer must disclose the balance on a deceased consumer's account, upon request by the administrator of the decedent's estate. A card issuer may provide the amount, if any, by a written statement or by telephone. This does not preclude a card issuer from providing the balance amount to appropriate persons, other than the administrator, such as the spouse or a relative of the decedent, who indicate that they may pay any balance. This provision does not relieve card issuers of the requirements to provide a periodic statement, under Sec. 226.5(b)(2). A periodic statement, under Sec. 226.5(b)(2), may satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.11(c)(2), if provided within 30 days of receiving a request by an administrator of the estate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Imposition of fees and interest charges. Section 226.11(c)(3) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees and finance charges due to a periodic interest rate based on balances for days that precede the date on which the card issuer receives a request pursuant to Sec. 226.11(c)(2). For example, if the last day of the billing cycle is June 30 and the card issuer receives a request pursuant to

Sec. 226.11(c)(2) on June 25, the card issuer may charge interest that accrued prior to June 25.</p><p class="depth0">5. Example. A card issuer receives a request from an administrator for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account on March 1. The card issuer discloses to the administrator on March 25 that the balance is $1,000. If the card issuer receives payment in full of the $1,000 on April 24, the card issuer must waive or rebate any additional interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance between March 25 and April 24. If the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000 on April 25, the card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25. If the card issuer receives a partial payment of $500 on April 24, the card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25.</p><p class="depth0">6. Application to joint accounts. A card issuer may impose fees and charges on an account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. If only an authorized user remains on the account of a deceased consumer, however, then a card issuer may not impose fees and charges.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.12--Special Credit Card Provisions</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Sections 226.12(a) and (b) deal with the issuance and liability rules for credit cards, whether the card is intended for consumer, business, or any other purposes. Sections 226.12(a) and (b) are exceptions to the general rule that the regulation applies only to consumer credit. (See Sec. Sec. 226.1 and 226.3.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Definition of ``accepted credit card''. For purposes of this section, ``accepted credit card'' means any credit card that a cardholder has requested or applied for and received, or has signed, used, or authorized another person to use to obtain credit. Any credit card issued as a renewal or substitute in accordance with Sec. 226.12(a) becomes an accepted credit card when received by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">12(a) Issuance of credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Explicit request. A request or application for a card must be explicit. For example, a request for an overdraft plan tied to a checking account does not constitute an application for a credit card with overdraft checking features.</p><p class="depth0">2. Addition of credit features. If the consumer has a non-credit card, the addition of credit features to the card (for example, the granting of overdraft privileges on a checking account when the consumer already has a check guarantee card) constitutes issuance of a credit card.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variance of card from request. The request or application need not correspond exactly to the card that is issued. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The name of the card requested may be different when issued.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The card may have features in addition to those reflected in the request or application.</p><p class="depth0">4. Permissible form of request. The request or application may be oral (in response to a telephone solicitation by a card issuer, for example) or written.</p><p class="depth0">5. Time of issuance. A credit card may be issued in response to a request made before any cards are ready for issuance (for example, if a new program is established), even if there is some delay in issuance.</p><p class="depth0">6. Persons to whom cards may be issued. A card issuer may issue a credit card to the person who requests it, and to anyone else for whom that person requests a card and who will be an authorized user on the requester's account. In other words, cards may be sent to consumer A on A's request, and also (on A's request) to consumers B and C, who will be authorized users on A's account. In these circumstances, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. The additional cards may be imprinted in either A's name or in the names of B and C.</p><p class="depth0">ii. No liability for unauthorized use (by persons other than B and C), not even the $50, may be imposed on B or C since they are merely users and not cardholders as that term is defined in Sec. 226.2 and used in Sec. 226.12(b); of course, liability of up to $50 for unauthorized use of B's and C's cards may be imposed on A.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Whether B and C may be held liable for their own use, or on the account generally, is a matter of state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">7. Issuance of non-credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">i. General. Under Sec. 226.12(a)(1), a credit card cannot be issued except in response to a request or an application. (See comment 2(a)(15)-2 for examples of cards or devices that are and are not credit cards.) A non-credit card may be sent on an unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to connect the card to any credit plan; a credit feature may be added to a previously issued non-credit card only upon the consumer's specific request.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A purchase-price discount card may be sent on an unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to connect the card to any credit plan. An issuer demonstrates that it proposes to connect the card to a credit plan by, for example, including promotional materials about credit features or account agreements and disclosures required by Sec. 226.6. The issuer will violate the rule against unsolicited issuance if, for example, at the time the card is sent a credit plan can be accessed by the card or the recipient of the unsolicited card has been preapproved for credit that the recipient can access by contacting the issuer and activating the card.</p><p class="depth0">8. Unsolicited issuance of PINs. A card issuer may issue personal identification numbers (PINs) to existing credit cardholders without a specific request from the cardholders, provided the PINs cannot be used alone to obtain credit. For example, the PINs may be necessary if consumers wish to use their existing credit cards at automated teller machines or at merchant locations with point of sale terminals that require PINs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Renewal. Renewal generally contemplates the regular replacement of existing cards because of, for example, security reasons or new technology or systems. It also includes the re-issuance of cards that have been suspended temporarily, but does not include the opening of a new account after a previous account was closed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substitution--examples. Substitution encompasses the replacement of one card with another because the underlying account relationship has changed in some way--such as when the card issuer has:</p><p class="depth0">i. Changed its name.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changed the name of the card.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Changed the credit or other features available on the account. For example, the original card could be used to make purchases and obtain cash advances at teller windows. The substitute card might be usable, in addition, for obtaining cash advances through automated teller machines. (If the substitute card constitutes an access device, as defined in Regulation E, then the Regulation E issuance rules would have to be followed.) The substitution of one card with another on an unsolicited basis is not permissible, however, where in conjunction with the substitution an additional credit card account is opened and the consumer is able to make new purchases or advances under both the original and the new account with the new card. For example, if a retail card issuer replaces its credit card with a combined retailer/bank card, each of the creditors maintains a separate account, and both accounts can be accessed for new transactions by use of the new credit card, the card cannot be provided to a consumer without solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Substituted a card user's name on the substitute card for the cardholder's name appearing on the original card.</p><p class="depth0">v. Changed the merchant base, provided that the new card is honored by at least one of the persons that honored the original card. However, unless the change in the merchant base is the addition of an affiliate of the existing merchant base, the substitution of a new card for another on an unsolicited basis is not permissible where the account is inactive. A credit card cannot be issued in these circumstances without a request or application. For purposes of Sec. 226.12(a), an account is inactive if no credit has been extended and if the account has no outstanding balance for the prior 24 months. (See Sec. 226.11(b)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Substitution--successor card issuer. Substitution also occurs when a successor card issuer replaces the original card issuer (for example, when a new card issuer purchases the accounts of the original issuer and issues its own card to replace the original one). A permissible substitution exists even if the original issuer retains the existing receivables and the new card issuer acquires the right only to future receivables, provided use of the original card is cut off when use of the new card becomes possible.</p><p class="depth0">4. Substitution--non-credit-card plan. A credit card that replaces a retailer's open-end credit plan not involving a credit card is not considered a substitute for the retailer's plan--even if the consumer used the retailer's plan. A credit card cannot be issued in these circumstances without a request or application.</p><p class="depth0">5. One-for-one rule. An accepted card may be replaced by no more than one renewal or substitute card. For example, the card issuer may not replace a credit card permitting purchases and cash advances with two cards, one for the purchases and another for the cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">6. One-for-one rule--exceptions. The regulation does not prohibit the card issuer from:</p><p class="depth0">i. Replacing a debit/credit card with a credit card and another card with only debit functions (or debit functions plus an associated overdraft capability), since the latter card could be issued on an unsolicited basis under Regulation E.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Replacing an accepted card with more than one renewal or substitute card, provided that:</p><p class="depth0">A. No replacement card accesses any account not accessed by the accepted card;</p><p class="depth0">B. For terms and conditions required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6, all replacement cards are issued subject to the same terms and conditions, except that a creditor may vary terms for which no change in terms notice is required under Sec. 226.9(c); and</p><p class="depth0">C. Under the account's terms the consumer's total liability for unauthorized use with respect to the account does not increase.</p><p class="depth0">7. Methods of terminating replaced card. The card issuer need not physically retrieve the original card, provided the old card is voided in some way, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The issuer includes with the new card a notification that the existing card is no longer valid and should be destroyed immediately.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The original card contained an expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The card issuer, in order to preclude use of the card, reprograms computers or issues instructions to authorization centers.</p><p class="depth0">8. Incomplete replacement. If a consumer has duplicate credit cards on the same account

(Card A--one type of bank credit card, for example), the card issuer may not replace the duplicate cards with one Card A and one Card B (Card B--another type of bank credit card) unless the consumer requests Card B.</p><p class="depth0">9. Multiple entities. Where multiple entities share responsibilities with respect to a credit card issued by one of them, the entity that issued the card may replace it on an unsolicited basis, if that entity terminates the original card by voiding it in some way, as described in comment 12(a)(2)-7. The other entity or entities may not issue a card on an unsolicited basis in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">12(b) Liability of cardholder for unauthorized use.</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning of cardholder. For purposes of this provision, cardholder includes any person (including organizations) to whom a credit card is issued for any purpose, including business. When a corporation is the cardholder, required disclosures should be provided to the corporation (as opposed to an employee user).</p><p class="depth0">2. Imposing liability. A card issuer is not required to impose liability on a cardholder for the unauthorized use of a credit card; if the card issuer does not seek to impose liability, the issuer need not conduct any investigation of the cardholder's claim.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonable investigation. If a card issuer seeks to impose liability when a claim of unauthorized use is made by a cardholder, the card issuer must conduct a reasonable investigation of the claim. In conducting its investigation, the card issuer may reasonably request the cardholder's cooperation. The card issuer may not automatically deny a claim based solely on the cardholder's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request, including providing an affidavit or filing a police report; however, if the card issuer otherwise has no knowledge of facts confirming the unauthorized use, the lack of information resulting from the cardholder's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the card issuer reasonably to terminate the investigation. The procedures involved in investigating claims may differ, but actions such as the following represent steps that a card issuer may take, as appropriate, in conducting a reasonable investigation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Reviewing the types or amounts of purchases made in relation to the cardholder's previous purchasing pattern.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Reviewing where the purchases were delivered in relation to the cardholder's residence or place of business.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Reviewing where the purchases were made in relation to where the cardholder resides or has normally shopped.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Comparing any signature on credit slips for the purchases to the signature of the cardholder or an authorized user in the card issuer's records, including other credit slips.</p><p class="depth0">v. Requesting documentation to assist in the verification of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Requiring a written, signed statement from the cardholder or authorized user. For example, the creditor may include a signature line on a billing rights form that the cardholder may send in to provide notice of the claim. However, a creditor may not require the cardholder to provide an affidavit or signed statement under penalty of perjury as part of a reasonable investigation.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Requesting a copy of a police report, if one was filed.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Requesting information regarding the cardholder's knowledge of the person who allegedly used the card or of that person's authority to do so.</p><p class="depth0">4. Checks that access a credit card account. The liability provisions for unauthorized use under Sec. 226.12(b)(1) only apply to transactions involving the use of a credit card, and not if an unauthorized transaction is made using a check accessing the credit card account. However, the billing error provisions in Sec. 226.13 apply to both of these types of transactions.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(1)(ii) Limitation on amount.</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning of authority. Section 226.12(b)(1)(i) defines unauthorized use in terms of whether the user has actual, implied, or apparent authority. Whether such authority exists must be determined under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Liability limits--dollar amounts. As a general rule, the cardholder's liability for a series of unauthorized uses cannot exceed either $50 or the value obtained through the unauthorized use before the card issuer is notified, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">3. Implied or apparent authority. If a cardholder furnishes a credit card and grants authority to make credit transactions to a person (such as a family member or coworker) who exceeds the authority given, the cardholder is liable for the transaction(s) unless the cardholder has notified the creditor that use of the credit card by that person is no longer authorized.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit card obtained through robbery or fraud. An unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, a transaction initiated by a person who has obtained the credit card from the consumer, or otherwise initiated the transaction, through fraud or robbery.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(2) Conditions of liability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Issuer's option not to comply. A card issuer that chooses not to impose any liability on cardholders for unauthorized use need not comply with the disclosure and identification requirements discussed in Sec. 226.12(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of liability and means of notifying issuer. The disclosures referred to in Sec. 226.12(b)(2)(ii) may be given, for example, with the initial disclosures under Sec. 226.6, on

the credit card itself, or on periodic statements. They may be given at any time preceding the unauthorized use of the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Meaning of ``adequate notice.'' For purposes of this provision, ``adequate notice'' means a printed notice to a cardholder that sets forth clearly the pertinent facts so that the cardholder may reasonably be expected to have noticed it and understood its meaning. The notice may be given by any means reasonably assuring receipt by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Means of identifying cardholder or user. To fulfill the condition set forth in Sec. 226.12(b)(2)(iii), the issuer must provide some method whereby the cardholder or the authorized user can be identified. This could include, for example, a signature, photograph, or fingerprint on the card or other biometric means, or electronic or mechanical confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification by magnetic strip. Unless a magnetic strip (or similar device not readable without physical aids) must be used in conjunction with a secret code or the like, it would not constitute sufficient means of identification. Sufficient identification also does not exist if a ``pool'' or group card, issued to a corporation and signed by a corporate agent who will not be a user of the card, is intended to be used by another employee for whom no means of identification is provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transactions not involving card. The cardholder may not be held liable under Sec. 226.12(b) when the card itself (or some other sufficient means of identification of the cardholder) is not presented. Since the issuer has not provided a means to identify the user under these circumstances, the issuer has not fulfilled one of the conditions for imposing liability. For example, when merchandise is ordered by telephone or the Internet by a person without authority to do so, using a credit card account number by itself or with other information that appears on the card (for example, the card expiration date and a 3- or 4-digit cardholder identification number), no liability may be imposed on the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(3) Notification to card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">1. How notice must be provided. Notice given in a normal business manner--for example, by mail, telephone, or personal visit--is effective even though it is not given to, or does not reach, some particular person within the issuer's organization. Notice also may be effective even though it is not given at the address or phone number disclosed by the card issuer under Sec. 226.12(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Who must provide notice. Notice of loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use need not be initiated by the cardholder. Notice is sufficient so long as it gives the ``pertinent information'' which would include the name or card number of the cardholder and an indication that unauthorized use has or may have occurred.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to Sec. 226.13. The liability protections afforded to cardholders in Sec. 226.12 do not depend upon the cardholder's following the error resolution procedures in Sec. 226.13. For example, the written notification and time limit requirements of Sec. 226.13 do not affect the Sec. 226.12 protections. (See also comment 12(b)-4.)</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(5) Business use of credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">1. Agreement for higher liability for business use cards. The card issuer may not rely on Sec. 226.12(b)(5) if the business is clearly not in a position to provide 10 or more cards to employees (for example, if the business has only 3 employees). On the other hand, the issuer need not monitor the personnel practices of the business to make sure that it has at least 10 employees at all times.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unauthorized use by employee. The protection afforded to an employee against liability for unauthorized use in excess of the limits set in Sec. 226.12(b) applies only to unauthorized use by someone other than the employee. If the employee uses the card in an unauthorized manner, the regulation sets no restriction on the employee's potential liability for such use.</p><p class="depth0">12(c) Right of cardholder to assert claims or defenses against card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.13. The Sec. 226.12(c) credit card ``holder in due course'' provision deals with the consumer's right to assert against the card issuer a claim or defense concerning property or services purchased with a credit card, if the merchant has been unwilling to resolve the dispute. Even though certain merchandise disputes, such as non-delivery of goods, may also constitute ``billing errors'' under Sec. 226.13, that section operates independently of Sec. 226.12(c). The cardholder whose asserted billing error involves undelivered goods may institute the error resolution procedures of Sec. 226.13; but whether or not the cardholder has done so, the cardholder may assert claims or defenses under Sec. 226.12(c). Conversely, the consumer may pay a disputed balance and thus have no further right to assert claims and defenses, but still may assert a billing error if notice of that billing error is given in the proper time and manner. An assertion that a particular transaction resulted from unauthorized use of the card could also be both a ``defense'' and a billing error.</p><p class="depth0">2. Claims and defenses assertible. Section 226.12(c) merely preserves the consumer's right to assert against the card issuer any claims or defenses that can be asserted against the merchant. It does not determine what claims or defenses are valid as to the merchant; this determination must be made under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transactions excluded. Section 226.12(c) does not apply to the use of a check guarantee card or a debit card in connection with

an overdraft credit plan, or to a check guarantee card used in connection with cash-advance checks.</p><p class="depth0">4. Method of calculating the amount of credit outstanding. The amount of the claim or defense that the cardholder may assert shall not exceed the amount of credit outstanding for the disputed transaction at the time the cardholder first notifies the card issuer or the person honoring the credit card of the existence of the claim or defense. However, when a consumer has asserted a claim or defense against a creditor pursuant to Sec. 226.12(c), the creditor must apply any payment or other credit in a manner that avoids or minimizes any reduction in the amount subject to that claim or defense. Accordingly, to determine the amount of credit outstanding for purposes of this section, payments and other credits must be applied first to amounts other than the disputed transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. For examples of how to comply with Sec. Sec. 226.12 and 226.53 for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, see comment 53-3.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For other types of credit card accounts, creditors may, at their option, apply payments consistent with Sec. 226.53 and comment 53-3. In the alternative, payments and other credits may be applied to: Late charges in the order of entry to the account; then to finance charges in the order of entry to the account; and then to any debits other than the transaction subject to the claim or defense in the order of entry to the account. In these circumstances, if more than one item is included in a single extension of credit, credits are to be distributed pro rata according to prices and applicable taxes.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(1) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Situations excluded and included. The consumer may assert claims or defenses only when the goods or services are ``purchased with the credit card.'' This could include mail, the Internet or telephone orders, if the purchase is charged to the credit card account. But it would exclude:</p><p class="depth0">i. Use of a credit card to obtain a cash advance, even if the consumer then uses the money to purchase goods or services. Such a transaction would not involve ``property or services purchased with the credit card.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. The purchase of goods or services by use of a check accessing an overdraft account and a credit card used solely for identification of the consumer. (On the other hand, if the credit card is used to make partial payment for the purchase and not merely for identification, the right to assert claims or defenses would apply to credit extended via the credit card, although not to the credit extended on the overdraft line.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Purchases made by use of a check guarantee card in conjunction with a cash advance check (or by cash advance checks alone). (See comment 12(c)-3.) A cash advance check is a check that, when written, does not draw on an asset account; instead, it is charged entirely to an open-end credit account.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Purchases effected by use of either a check guarantee card or a debit card when used to draw on overdraft credit plans. (See comment 12(c)-3.) The debit card exemption applies whether the card accesses an asset account via point of sale terminals, automated teller machines, or in any other way, and whether the card qualifies as an ``access device'' under Regulation E or is only a paper based debit card. If a card serves both as an ordinary credit card and also as check guarantee or debit card, a transaction will be subject to this rule on asserting claims and defenses when used as an ordinary credit card, but not when used as a check guarantee or debit card.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(2) Adverse credit reports prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of prohibition. Although an amount in dispute may not be reported as delinquent until the matter is resolved:</p><p class="depth0">i. That amount may be reported as disputed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nothing in this provision prohibits the card issuer from undertaking its normal collection activities for the delinquent and undisputed portion of the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Settlement of dispute. A card issuer may not consider a dispute settled and report an amount disputed as delinquent or begin collection of the disputed amount until it has completed a reasonable investigation of the cardholder's claim. A reasonable investigation requires an independent assessment of the cardholder's claim based on information obtained from both the cardholder and the merchant, if possible. In conducting an investigation, the card issuer may request the cardholder's reasonable cooperation. The card issuer may not automatically consider a dispute settled if the cardholder fails or refuses to comply with a particular request. However, if the card issuer otherwise has no means of obtaining information necessary to resolve the dispute, the lack of information resulting from the cardholder's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the card issuer reasonably to terminate the investigation.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(3) Limitations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(c)(3)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Resolution with merchant. The consumer must have tried to resolve the dispute with the merchant. This does not require any special procedures or correspondence between them, and is a matter for factual determination in each case. The consumer is not required to seek satisfaction from the manufacturer of the goods involved. When the merchant is in bankruptcy proceedings, the consumer is not required to file a claim in those proceedings, and may instead file a claim for the property or service purchased

with the credit card with the card issuer directly.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(c)(3)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Geographic limitation. The question of where a transaction occurs (as in the case of mail, Internet, or telephone orders, for example) is to be determined under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Merchant honoring card. The exceptions (stated in Sec. 226.12(c)(3)(ii)) to the amount and geographic limitations in Sec. 226.12(c)(3)(i)(B) do not apply if the merchant merely honors, or indicates through signs or advertising that it honors, a particular credit card.</p><p class="depth0">12(d) Offsets by card issuer prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Holds on accounts. ``Freezing'' or placing a hold on funds in the cardholder's deposit account is the functional equivalent of an offset and would contravene the prohibition in Sec. 226.12(d)(1), unless done in the context of one of the exceptions specified in Sec. 226.12(d)(2). For example, if the terms of a security agreement permitted the card issuer to place a hold on the funds, the hold would not violate the offset prohibition. Similarly, if an order of a bankruptcy court required the card issuer to turn over deposit account funds to the trustee in bankruptcy, the issuer would not violate the regulation by placing a hold on the funds in order to comply with the court order.</p><p class="depth0">2. Funds intended as deposits. If the consumer tenders funds as a deposit (to a checking account, for example), the card issuer may not apply the funds to repay indebtedness on the consumer's credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Types of indebtedness; overdraft accounts. The offset prohibition applies to any indebtedness arising from transactions under a credit card plan, including accrued finance charges and other charges on the account. The prohibition also applies to balances arising from transactions not using the credit card itself but taking place under plans that involve credit cards. For example, if the consumer writes a check that accesses an overdraft line of credit, the resulting indebtedness is subject to the offset prohibition since it is incurred through a credit card plan, even though the consumer did not use an associated check guarantee or debit card.</p><p class="depth0">4. When prohibition applies in case of termination of account. The offset prohibition applies even after the card issuer terminates the cardholder's credit card privileges, if the indebtedness was incurred prior to termination. If the indebtedness was incurred after termination, the prohibition does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Security interest--limitations. In order to qualify for the exception stated in Sec. 226.12(d)(2), a security interest must be affirmatively agreed to by the consumer and must be disclosed in the issuer's account-opening disclosures under Sec. 226.6. The security interest must not be the functional equivalent of a right of offset; as a result, routinely including in agreements contract language indicating that consumers are giving a security interest in any deposit accounts maintained with the issuer does not result in a security interest that falls within the exception in Sec. 226.12(d)(2). For a security interest to qualify for the exception under Sec. 226.12(d)(2) the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a condition for the credit card account (or for more favorable account terms) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a deposit account. Indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent include at least one of the following (or a substantially similar procedure that evidences the consumer's awareness and intent):</p><p class="depth0">A. Separate signature or initials on the agreement indicating that a security interest is being given.</p><p class="depth0">B. Placement of the security agreement on a separate page, or otherwise separating the security interest provisions from other contract and disclosure provisions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reference to a specific amount of deposited funds or to a specific deposit account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The security interest must be obtainable and enforceable by creditors generally. If other creditors could not obtain a security interest in the consumer's deposit accounts to the same extent as the card issuer, the security interest is prohibited by Sec. 226.12(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Security interest--after-acquired property. As used in Sec. 226.12(d)(2), the term ``security interest'' does not exclude (as it does for other Regulation Z purposes) interests in after-acquired property. Thus, a consensual security interest in deposit-account funds, including funds deposited after the granting of the security interest would constitute a permissible exception to the prohibition on offsets.</p><p class="depth0">3. Court order. If the card issuer obtains a judgment against the cardholder, and if state and other applicable law and the terms of the judgment do not so prohibit, the card issuer may offset the indebtedness against the cardholder's deposit account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Automatic payment plans--scope of exception. With regard to automatic debit plans under Sec. 226.12(d)(3), the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. The cardholder's authorization must be in writing and signed or initialed by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The authorizing language need not appear directly above or next to the cardholder's signature or initials, provided it appears on the same document and that it clearly spells out the terms of the automatic debit plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the cardholder has the option to accept or reject the automatic debit feature (such option may be required under section 913 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act), the fact that the option exists should be clearly indicated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automatic payment plans--additional exceptions. The following practices are not prohibited by Sec. 226.12(d)(1):</p><p class="depth0">i. Automatically deducting charges for participation in a program of banking services (one aspect of which may be a credit card plan).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Debiting the cardholder's deposit account on the cardholder's specific request rather than on an automatic periodic basis (for example, a cardholder might check a box on the credit card bill stub, requesting the issuer to debit the cardholder's account to pay that bill).</p><p class="depth0">12(e) Prompt notification of returns and crediting of refunds.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Normal channels. The term normal channels refers to any network or interchange system used for the processing of the original charge slips (or equivalent information concerning the transaction).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting account. The card issuer need not actually post the refund to the consumer's account within three business days after receiving the credit statement, provided that it credits the account as of a date within that time period.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.13--Billing Error Resolution</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditor's failure to comply with billing error provisions. Failure to comply with the error resolution procedures may result in the forfeiture of disputed amounts as prescribed in section 161(e) of the act. (Any failure to comply may also be a violation subject to the liability provisions of section 130 of the act.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges for error resolution. If a billing error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the creditor may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation) and must credit the consumer's account if such a charge was assessed pending resolution. Since the act grants the consumer error resolution rights, the creditor should avoid any chilling effect on the good faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed when no billing error has occurred.</p><p class="depth0">13(a) Definition of billing error.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Actual, implied, or apparent authority. Whether use of a credit card or open-end credit plan is authorized is determined by state or other applicable law. (See comment 12(b)(1)(ii)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. Section 226.13(a)(3) covers disputes about goods or services that are ``not accepted'' or ``not delivered * * * as agreed''; for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The appearance on a periodic statement of a purchase, when the consumer refused to take delivery of goods because they did not comply with the contract.</p><p class="depth0">B. Delivery of property or services different from that agreed upon.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery of the wrong quantity.</p><p class="depth0">D. Late delivery.</p><p class="depth0">E. Delivery to the wrong location.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 226.13(a)(3) does not apply to a dispute relating to the quality of property or services that the consumer accepts. Whether acceptance occurred is determined by state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application to purchases made using a third-party payment intermediary. Section 226.13(a)(3) generally applies to disputes about goods and services that are purchased using a third-party payment intermediary, such as a person-to-person Internet payment service, funded through use of a consumer's open-end credit plan when the goods or services are not accepted by the consumer or not delivered to the consumer as agreed. However, the extension of credit must be made at the time the consumer purchases the good or service and match the amount of the transaction to purchase the good or service (including ancillary taxes and fees). Under these circumstances, the property or service for which the extension of credit is made is not the payment service, but rather the good or service that the consumer has purchased using the payment service. Thus, for example, Sec. 226.13(a)(3) would not apply to purchases using a third party payment intermediary that is funded through use of an open-end credit plan if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The extension of credit is made to fund the third-party payment intermediary ``account,'' but the consumer does not contemporaneously use those funds to purchase a good or service at that time.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The extension of credit is made to fund only a portion of the purchase amount, and the consumer uses other sources to fund the remaining amount.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notice to merchant not required. A consumer is not required to first notify the merchant or other payee from whom he or she has purchased goods or services and attempt to resolve a dispute regarding the good or service before providing a billing-error notice to the creditor under Sec. 226.13(a)(3) asserting that the goods or services were not accepted or delivered as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Computational errors. In periodic statements that are combined with other information, the error resolution procedures are triggered only if the consumer asserts a computational billing error in the credit-related

portion of the periodic statement. For example, if a bank combines a periodic statement reflecting the consumer's credit card transactions with the consumer's monthly checking statement, a computational error in the checking account portion of the combined statement is not a billing error.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0">1. Documentation requests. A request for documentation such as receipts or sales slips, unaccompanied by an allegation of an error under Sec. 226.13(a) or a request for additional clarification under Sec. 226.13(a)(6), does not trigger the error resolution procedures. For example, a request for documentation merely for purposes such as tax preparation or recordkeeping does not trigger the error resolution procedures.</p><p class="depth0">13(b) Billing error notice.</p><p class="depth0">1. Withdrawal of billing error notice by consumer. The creditor need not comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.13(c) through (g) of this section if the consumer concludes that no billing error occurred and voluntarily withdraws the billing error notice. The consumer's withdrawal of a billing error notice may be oral, electronic or written.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of written notice. The creditor may require that the written notice not be made on the payment medium or other material accompanying the periodic statement if the creditor so stipulates in the billing rights statement required by Sec. Sec. 226.6(a)(5) or (b)(5)(iii), and 226.9(a). In addition, if the creditor stipulates in the billing rights statement that it accepts billing error notices submitted electronically, and states the means by which a consumer may electronically submit a billing error notice, a notice sent in such manner will be deemed to satisfy the written notice requirement for purposes of Sec. 226.13(b).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to send periodic statement--timing. If the creditor has failed to send a periodic statement, the 60-day period runs from the time the statement should have been sent. Once the statement is provided, the consumer has another 60 days to assert any billing errors reflected on it.</p><p class="depth0">2. Failure to reflect credit--timing. If the periodic statement fails to reflect a credit to the account, the 60-day period runs from transmittal of the statement on which the credit should have appeared.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transmittal. If a consumer has arranged for periodic statements to be held at the financial institution until called for, the statement is ``transmitted'' when it is first made available to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Identity of the consumer. The billing error notice need not specify both the name and the account number if the information supplied enables the creditor to identify the consumer's name and account.</p><p class="depth0">13(c) Time for resolution; general procedures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Temporary or provisional corrections. A creditor may temporarily correct the consumer's account in response to a billing error notice, but is not excused from complying with the remaining error resolution procedures within the time limits for resolution.</p><p class="depth0">2. Correction without investigation. A creditor may correct a billing error in the manner and amount asserted by the consumer without the investigation or the determination normally required. The creditor must comply, however, with all other applicable provisions. If a creditor follows this procedure, no presumption is created that a billing error occurred.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship with Sec. 226.12. The consumer's rights under the billing error provisions in Sec. 226.13 are independent of the provisions set forth in Sec. 226.12(b) and (c). (See comments 12(b)-4, 12(b)(3)-3, and 12(c)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Time for resolution. The phrase two complete billing cycles means two actual billing cycles occurring after receipt of the billing error notice, not a measure of time equal to two billing cycles. For example, if a creditor on a monthly billing cycle receives a billing error notice mid-cycle, it has the remainder of that cycle plus the next two full billing cycles to resolve the error.</p><p class="depth0">2. Finality of error resolution procedure. A creditor must comply with the error resolution procedures and complete its investigation to determine whether an error occurred within two complete billing cycles as set forth in Sec. 226.13(c)(2). Thus, for example, Sec. 226.13(c)(2) prohibits a creditor from reversing amounts previously credited for an alleged billing error even if the creditor obtains evidence after the error resolution time period has passed indicating that the billing error did not occur as asserted by the consumer. Similarly, if a creditor fails to mail or deliver a written explanation setting forth the reason why the billing error did not occur as asserted, or otherwise fails to comply with the error resolution procedures set forth in Sec. 226.13(f), the creditor generally must credit the disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as applicable, to the consumer's account. However, if a consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same billing error, Sec. 226.13 does not prevent a creditor from reversing amounts it has previously credited to correct that error, provided that the total amount of the remaining credits is equal to or more than the amount of the error and that the consumer does not incur any fees or other charges as a result of the timing of the creditor's reversal. For example, assume that a consumer asserts a billing error with respect to a $100 transaction and that the creditor posts a $100 credit to the consumer's account to correct that error during the time period set forth in Sec. 226.13(c)(2). However, following that time

period, a merchant or other person honoring the credit card issues a $100 credit to the consumer to correct the same error. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.13(c)(2) does not prohibit the creditor from reversing its $100 credit once the $100 credit from the merchant or other person has posted to the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">13(d) Rules pending resolution.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disputed amount. Disputed amount is the dollar amount alleged by the consumer to be in error. When the allegation concerns the description or identification of the transaction (such as the date or the seller's name) rather than a dollar amount, the disputed amount is the amount of the transaction or charge that corresponds to the disputed transaction identification. If the consumer alleges a failure to send a periodic statement under Sec. 226.13(a)(7), the disputed amount is the entire balance owing.</p><p class="depth0">13(d)(1) Consumer's right to withhold disputed amount; collection action prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibited collection actions. During the error resolution period, the creditor is prohibited from trying to collect the disputed amount from the consumer. Prohibited collection actions include, for example, instituting court action, taking a lien, or instituting attachment proceedings.</p><p class="depth0">2. Right to withhold payment. If the creditor reflects any disputed amount or related finance or other charges on the periodic statement, and is therefore required to make the disclosure under Sec. 226.13(d)(4), the creditor may comply with that disclosure requirement by indicating that payment of any disputed amount is not required pending resolution. Making a disclosure that only refers to the disputed amount would, of course, in no way affect the consumer's right under Sec. 226.13(d)(1) to withhold related finance and other charges. The disclosure under Sec. 226.13(d)(4) need not appear in any specific place on the periodic statement, need not state the specific amount that the consumer may withhold, and may be preprinted on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Imposition of additional charges on undisputed amounts. The consumer's withholding of a disputed amount from the total bill cannot subject undisputed balances (including new purchases or cash advances made during the present or subsequent cycles) to the imposition of finance or other charges. For example, if on an account with a grace period (that is, an account in which paying the new balance in full allows the consumer to avoid the imposition of additional finance charges), a consumer disputes a $2 item out of a total bill of $300 and pays $298 within the grace period, the consumer would not lose the grace period as to any undisputed amounts, even if the creditor determines later that no billing error occurred. Furthermore, finance or other charges may not be imposed on any new purchases or advances that, absent the unpaid disputed balance, would not have finance or other charges imposed on them. Finance or other charges that would have been incurred even if the consumer had paid the disputed amount would not be affected.</p><p class="depth0">4. Automatic payment plans--coverage. The coverage of this provision is limited to the card issuer's automatic payment plans, whether or not the consumer's asset account is held by the card issuer or by another financial institution. It does not apply to automatic or bill-payment plans offered by financial institutions other than the credit card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Automatic payment plans--time of notice. While the card issuer does not have to restore or prevent the debiting of a disputed amount if the billing error notice arrives after the three-business-day cut-off, the card issuer must, however, prevent the automatic debit of any part of the disputed amount that is still outstanding and unresolved at the time of the next scheduled debit date.</p><p class="depth0">13(d)(2) Adverse credit reports prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. Report of dispute. Although the creditor must not issue an adverse credit report because the consumer fails to pay the disputed amount or any related charges, the creditor may report that the amount or the account is in dispute. Also, the creditor may report the account as delinquent if undisputed amounts remain unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">2. Person. During the error resolution period, the creditor is prohibited from making an adverse credit report about the disputed amount to any person--including employers, insurance companies, other creditors, and credit bureaus.</p><p class="depth0">3. Creditor's agent. Whether an agency relationship exists between a creditor and an issuer of an adverse credit report is determined by State or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">13(e) Procedures if billing error occurred as asserted.</p><p class="depth0">1. Correction of error. The phrase as applicable means that the necessary corrections vary with the type of billing error that occurred. For example, a misidentified transaction (or a transaction that is identified by one of the alternative methods in Sec. 226.8) is cured by properly identifying the transaction and crediting related finance and any other charges imposed. The creditor is not required to cancel the amount of the underlying obligation incurred by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of correction notice. The written correction notice may take a variety of forms. It may be sent separately, or it may be included on or with a periodic statement that is mailed within the time for resolution. If the periodic statement is used, the amount of the billing error must be specifically identified. If a separate billing error correction notice is provided, the accompanying or subsequent periodic statement reflecting the

corrected amount may simply identify it as credit.</p><p class="depth0">3. Discovery of information after investigation period. See comment 13(c)(2)-2.</p><p class="depth0">13(f) Procedures if different billing error or no billing error occurred.</p><p class="depth0">1. Different billing error. Examples of a different billing error include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Differences in the amount of an error (for example, the customer asserts a $55.00 error but the error was only $53.00).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Differences in other particulars asserted by the consumer (such as when a consumer asserts that a particular transaction never occurred, but the creditor determines that only the seller's name was disclosed incorrectly).</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of creditor's explanation. The written explanation (which also may notify the consumer of corrections to the account) may take a variety of forms. It may be sent separately, or it may be included on or with a periodic statement that is mailed within the time for resolution. If the creditor uses the periodic statement for the explanation and correction(s), the corrections must be specifically identified. If a separate explanation, including the correction notice, is provided, the enclosed or subsequent periodic statement reflecting the corrected amount may simply identify it as a credit. The explanation may be combined with the creditor's notice to the consumer of amounts still owing, which is required under Sec. 226.13(g)(1), provided it is sent within the time limit for resolution. (See commentary to Sec. 226.13(e).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonable investigation. A creditor must conduct a reasonable investigation before it determines that no billing error occurred or that a different billing error occurred from that asserted. In conducting its investigation of an allegation of a billing error, the creditor may reasonably request the consumer's cooperation. The creditor may not automatically deny a claim based solely on the consumer's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request, including providing an affidavit or filing a police report. However, if the creditor otherwise has no knowledge of facts confirming the billing error, the lack of information resulting from the consumer's failure or refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the creditor reasonably to terminate the investigation. The procedures involved in investigating alleged billing errors may differ depending on the billing error type.</p><p class="depth0">i. Unauthorized transaction. In conducting an investigation of a notice of billing error alleging an unauthorized transaction under Sec. 226.13(a)(1), actions such as the following represent steps that a creditor may take, as appropriate, in conducting a reasonable investigation:</p><p class="depth0">A. Reviewing the types or amounts of purchases made in relation to the consumer's previous purchasing pattern.</p><p class="depth0">B. Reviewing where the purchases were delivered in relation to the consumer's residence or place of business.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reviewing where the purchases were made in relation to where the consumer resides or has normally shopped.</p><p class="depth0">D. Comparing any signature on credit slips for the purchases to the signature of the consumer (or an authorized user in the case of a credit card account) in the creditor's records, including other credit slips.</p><p class="depth0">E. Requesting documentation to assist in the verification of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">F. Requiring a written, signed statement from the consumer (or authorized user, in the case of a credit card account). For example, the creditor may include a signature line on a billing rights form that the consumer may send in to provide notice of the claim. However, a creditor may not require the consumer to provide an affidavit or signed statement under penalty of perjury as a part of a reasonable investigation.</p><p class="depth0">G. Requesting a copy of a police report, if one was filed.</p><p class="depth0">H. Requesting information regarding the consumer's knowledge of the person who allegedly obtained an extension of credit on the account or of that person's authority to do so.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nondelivery of property or services. In conducting an investigation of a billing error notice alleging the nondelivery of property or services under Sec. 226.13(a)(3), the creditor shall not deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and determines that the property or services were actually delivered, mailed, or sent as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Incorrect information. In conducting an investigation of a billing error notice alleging that information appearing on a periodic statement is incorrect because a person honoring the consumer's credit card or otherwise accepting an access device for an open-end plan has made an incorrect report to the creditor, the creditor shall not deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and determines that the information was correct.</p><p class="depth0">13(g) Creditor's rights and duties after resolution.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts owed by consumer. Amounts the consumer still owes may include both minimum periodic payments and related finance and other charges that accrued during the resolution period. As explained in the commentary to Sec. 226.13(d)(1), even if the creditor later determines that no billing error occurred, the creditor may not include finance or other charges that are imposed on undisputed balances solely as a result of a consumer's withholding payment of a disputed amount.</p><p class="depth0">2. Time of notice. The creditor need not send the notice of amount owed within the time period for resolution, although it is under a

duty to send the notice promptly after resolution of the alleged error. If the creditor combines the notice of the amount owed with the explanation required under Sec. 226.13(f)(1), the combined notice must be provided within the time limit for resolution.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period if no error occurred. If the creditor determines, after a reasonable investigation, that a billing error did not occur as asserted, and the consumer was entitled to a grace period at the time the consumer provided the billing error notice, the consumer must be given a period of time equal to the grace period disclosed under Sec. 226.6(a)(1) or (b)(2) and Sec. 226.7(a)(8) or (b)(8) to pay any disputed amounts due without incurring additional finance or other charges. However, the creditor need not allow a grace period disclosed under the above-mentioned sections to pay the amount due under Sec. 226.13(g)(1) if no error occurred and the consumer was not entitled to a grace period at the time the consumer asserted the error. For example, assume that a creditor provides a consumer a grace period of 20 days to pay a new balance to avoid finance charges, and that the consumer did not carry an outstanding balance from the prior month. If the consumer subsequently asserts a billing error for the current statement period within the 20-day grace period, and the creditor determines that no billing error in fact occurred, the consumer must be given at least 20 days (i.e., the full disclosed grace period) to pay the amount due without incurring additional finance charges. Conversely, if the consumer was not entitled to a grace period at the time the consumer asserted the billing error, for example, if the consumer did not pay the previous monthly balance of undisputed charges in full, the creditor may assess finance charges on the disputed balance for the entire period the item was in dispute.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Time for payment. The consumer has a minimum of 10 days to pay (measured from the time the consumer could reasonably be expected to have received notice of the amount owed) before the creditor may issue an adverse credit report; if an initially disclosed grace period allows the consumer a longer time in which to pay, the consumer has the benefit of that longer period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit reporting. Under Sec. 226.13(g)(4)(i) and (iii) the creditor's additional credit reporting responsibilities must be accomplished promptly. The creditor need not establish costly procedures to fulfill this requirement. For example, a creditor that reports to a credit bureau on scheduled updates need not transmit corrective information by an unscheduled computer or magnetic tape; it may provide the credit bureau with the correct information by letter or other commercially reasonable means when using the scheduled update would not be ``prompt.'' The creditor is not responsible for ensuring that the credit bureau corrects its information immediately.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adverse report to credit bureau. If a creditor made an adverse report to a credit bureau that disseminated the information to other creditors, the creditor fulfills its Sec. 226.13(g)(4)(ii) obligations by providing the consumer with the name and address of the credit bureau.</p><p class="depth0">13(i) Relation to Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Credit extended directly from a non-overdraft credit line is governed solely by Regulation Z, even though a combined credit card/access device is used to obtain the extension.</p><p class="depth0">2. Incidental credit under agreement. Credit extended incident to an electronic fund transfer under an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution is governed by Sec. 226.13(i), which provides that certain error resolution procedures in both this regulation and Regulation E apply. Incidental credit that is not extended under an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution is governed solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E. For example, credit inadvertently extended incident to an electronic fund-transfer, such as under an overdraft service not subject to Regulation Z, is governed solely by the Regulation E error resolution procedures, if the bank and the consumer do not have an agreement to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">3. Application to debit/credit transactions-examples. If a consumer withdraws money at an automated teller machine and activates an overdraft credit feature on the checking account:</p><p class="depth0">i. An error asserted with respect to the transaction is subject, for error resolution purposes, to the applicable Regulation E provisions (such as timing and notice) for the entire transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor need not provisionally credit the consumer's account, under Sec. 205.11(c)(2)(i) of Regulation E, for any portion of the unpaid extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor must credit the consumer's account under Sec. 205.11(c) with any finance or other charges incurred as a result of the alleged error.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 226.13(d) and (g) apply only to the credit portion of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.14--Determination of Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">14(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Tolerance. The tolerance of \1/8\th of 1 percentage point above or below the annual percentage rate applies to any required disclosure of the annual percentage rate. The disclosure of the annual percentage rate is required in Sec. Sec. 226.5a, 226.5b, 226.6, 226.7, 226.9, 226.15, 226.16, 226.26, 226.55, and 226.56.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rounding. The regulation does not require that the annual percentage rate be calculated to any particular number of decimal places; rounding is permissible within the \1/8\th of 1 percent tolerance. For example, an exact annual percentage rate of 14.33333% may be stated as 14.33% or as 14.3%, or even as 14\1/4\%; but it could not be stated as 14.2% or 14%, since each varies by more than the permitted tolerance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Periodic rates. No explicit tolerance exists for any periodic rate as such; a disclosed periodic rate may vary from precise accuracy (for example, due to rounding) only to the extent that its annualized equivalent is within the tolerance permitted by Sec. 226.14(a). Further, a periodic rate need not be calculated to any particular number of decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charges. The regulation does not prohibit creditors from assessing finance charges on balances that include prior, unpaid finance charges; state or other applicable law may do so, however.</p><p class="depth0">5. Good faith reliance on faulty calculation tools. The regulation relieves a creditor of liability for an error in the annual percentage rate or finance charge that resulted from a corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good faith by the creditor. Whether or not the creditor's use of the tool was in good faith must be determined on a case-by-case basis, but the creditor must in any case have taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the tool, including any instructions, before using it. Generally, the safe harbor from liability is available only for errors directly attributable to the calculation tool itself, including software programs; it is not intended to absolve a creditor of liability for its own errors, or for errors arising from improper use of the tool, from incorrect data entry, or from misapplication of the law.</p><p class="depth0">6. Effect of leap year. Any variance in the annual percentage rate that occurs solely by reason of the addition of February 29 in a leap year, may be disregarded, and such a rate may be disclosed without regard to such variance.</p><p class="depth0">14(b) Annual percentage rate--in general.</p><p class="depth0">1. Corresponding annual percentage rate computation. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 226.5a, 226.5b, 226.6, 226.7(a)(4) or (b)(4), 226.9, 226.15, 226.16, 226.26, 226.55, and 226.56, the annual percentage rate is determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in the year. This computation reflects the fact that, in such disclosures, the rate (known as the corresponding annual percentage rate) is prospective and does not involve any particular finance charge or periodic balance.</p><p class="depth0">14(c) Optional effective annual percentage rate for periodic statements for creditors offering open-end plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. The periodic statement may reflect (under Sec. 226.7(a)(7)) the annualized equivalent of the rate actually applied during a particular cycle; this rate may differ from the corresponding annual percentage rate because of the inclusion of, for example, fixed, minimum, or transaction charges. Sections 226.14(c)(1) through (c)(4) state the computation rules for the effective rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges related to opening, renewing, or continuing an account. Sections 226.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) exclude from the calculation of the effective annual percentage rate finance charges that are imposed during the billing cycle such as a loan fee, points, or similar charge that relates to opening, renewing, or continuing an account. The charges involved here do not relate to a specific transaction or to specific activity on the account, but relate solely to the opening, renewing, or continuing of the account. For example, an annual fee to renew an open-end credit account that is a percentage of the credit limit on the account, or that is charged only to consumers that have not used their credit card for a certain dollar amount in transactions during the preceding year, would not be included in the calculation of the annual percentage rate, even though the fee may not be excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4(c)(4). (See comment 4(c)(4)-2.) This rule applies even if the loan fee, points, or similar charges are billed on a subsequent periodic statement or withheld from the proceeds of the first advance on the account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Classification of charges. If the finance charge includes a charge not due to the application of a periodic rate, the creditor must use the annual percentage rate computation method that corresponds to the type of charge imposed. If the charge is tied to a specific transaction (for example, 3 percent of the amount of each transaction), then the method in Sec. 226.14(c)(3) must be used. If a fixed or minimum charge is applied, that is, one not tied to any specific transaction, then the formula in Sec. 226.14(c)(2) is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Small finance charges. Section 226.14(c)(4) gives the creditor an alternative to Sec. 226.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) if small finance charges (50 cents or less) are involved; that is, if the finance charge includes minimum or fixed fees not due to the application of a periodic rate and the total finance charge for the cycle does not exceed 50 cents. For example, while a monthly activity fee of 50 cents on a balance of $20 would produce an annual percentage rate of 30 percent under the rule in Sec. 226.14(c)(2), the creditor may disclose an annual percentage rate of 18 percent if the

periodic rate generally applicable to all balances is 1\1/2\ percent per month.</p><p class="depth0">5. Prior-cycle adjustments. i. The annual percentage rate reflects the finance charges imposed during the billing cycle. However, finance charges imposed during the billing cycle may relate to activity in a prior cycle. Examples of circumstances when this may occur are:</p><p class="depth0">A. A cash advance occurs on the last day of a billing cycle on an account that uses the transaction date to figure finance charges, and it is impracticable to post the transaction until the following cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. An adjustment to the finance charge is made following the resolution of a billing error dispute.</p><p class="depth0">C. A consumer fails to pay the purchase balance under a deferred payment feature by the payment due date, and finance charges are imposed from the date of purchase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Finance charges relating to activity in prior cycles should be reflected on the periodic statement as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. If a finance charge imposed in the current billing cycle is attributable to periodic rates applicable to prior billing cycles (such as when a deferred payment balance was not paid in full by the payment due date and finance charges from the date of purchase are now being debited to the account, or when a cash advance occurs on the last day of a billing cycle on an account that uses the transaction date to figure finance charges and it is impracticable to post the transaction until the following cycle), and the creditor uses the quotient method to calculate the annual percentage rate, the numerator would include the amount of any transaction charges plus any other finance charges posted during the billing cycle. At the creditor's option, balances relating to the finance charge adjustment may be included in the denominator if permitted by the legal obligation, if it was impracticable to post the transaction in the previous cycle because of timing, or if the adjustment is covered by comment 14(c)-5.ii.B.</p><p class="depth0">B. If a finance charge that is posted to the account relates to activity for which a finance charge was debited or credited to the account in a previous billing cycle (for example, if the finance charge relates to an adjustment such as the resolution of a billing error dispute, or an unintentional posting error, or a payment by check that was later returned unpaid for insufficient funds or other reasons), the creditor shall at its option:</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculate the annual percentage rate in accordance with ii.A. of this paragraph, or</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclose the finance charge adjustment on the periodic statement and calculate the annual percentage rate for the current billing cycle without including the finance charge adjustment in the numerator and balances associated with the finance charge adjustment in the denominator.</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(1) Solely periodic rates imposed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic rates. Section 226.14(c)(1) applies if the only finance charge imposed is due to the application of a periodic rate to a balance. The creditor may compute the annual percentage rate either:</p><p class="depth0">i. By multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in the year; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. By the ``quotient'' method. This method refers to a composite annual percentage rate when different periodic rates apply to different balances. For example, a particular plan may involve a periodic rate of \1/2\ percent on balances up to $500, and 1 percent on balances over $500. If, in a given cycle, the consumer has a balance of $800, the finance charge would consist of $7.50 (500 x .015) plus $3.00 (300 x .01), for a total finance charge of $10.50. The annual percentage rate for this period may be disclosed either as 18% on $500 and 12 percent on $300, or as 15.75 percent on a balance of $800 (the quotient of $10.50 divided by $800, multiplied by 12).</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(2) Minimum or fixed charge, but not transaction charge, imposed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Certain charges not based on periodic rates. Section 226.14(c)(2) specifies use of the quotient method to determine the annual percentage rate if the finance charge imposed includes a certain charge not due to the application of a periodic rate (other than a charge relating to a specific transaction). For example, if the creditor imposes a minimum $1 finance charge on all balances below $50, and the consumer's balance was $40 in a particular cycle, the creditor would disclose an annual percentage rate of 30 percent (1/40 x 12).</p><p class="depth0">2. No balance. If there is no balance to which the finance charge is applicable, an annual percentage rate cannot be determined under Sec. 226.14(c)(2). This could occur not only when minimum charges are imposed on an account with no balance, but also when a periodic rate is applied to advances from the date of the transaction. For example, if on May 19 the consumer pays the new balance in full from a statement dated May 1, and has no further transactions reflected on the June 1 statement, that statement would reflect a finance charge with no account balance.</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(3) Transaction charge imposed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Transaction charges. i. Section 226.14(c)(3) transaction charges include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A loan fee of $10 imposed on a particular advance.</p><p class="depth0">B. A charge of 3 percent of the amount of each transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The reference to avoiding duplication in the computation requires that the amounts of transactions on which transaction charges were imposed not be included both in the amount of total balances and in the ``other

amounts on which a finance charge was imposed'' figure. In a multifeatured plan, creditors may consider each bona fide feature separately in the calculation of the denominator. A creditor has considerable flexibility in defining features for open-end plans, as long as the creditor has a reasonable basis for the distinctions. For further explanation and examples of how to determine the components of this formula, see appendix F to part 226.</p><p class="depth0">2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. Section 226.14(c)(3) sets forth an acceptable method for calculating the annual percentage rate if the finance charge results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the application of a daily periodic rate. This section includes the requirement that the creditor follow the rules in appendix F to part 226 in calculating the annual percentage rate, especially the provision in the introductory section of appendix F which addresses the daily rate/transaction charge situation by providing that the ``average of daily balances'' shall be used instead of the ``sum of the balances.''</p><p class="depth0">14(d) Calculations where daily periodic rate applied.</p><p class="depth0">1. Quotient method. Section 226.14(d) addresses use of a daily periodic rate(s) to determine some or all of the finance charge and use of the quotient method to determine the annual percentage rate. Since the quotient formula in Sec. 226.14(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) cannot be used when a daily rate is being applied to a series of daily balances, Sec. 226.14(d) provides two alternative ways to calculate the annual percentage rate--either of which satisfies the provisions of Sec. 226.7(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. If the finance charge results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the application of a daily periodic rate, see comment 14(c)(3)-2 for guidance on an appropriate calculation method.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.15--Right of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions not covered. Credit extensions that are not subject to the regulation are not covered by Sec. 226.15 even if the customer's principal dwelling is the collateral securing the credit. For this purpose, credit extensions also would include the occurrences listed in Comment 15(a)(1)-1. For example, the right of rescission does not apply to the opening of a business-purpose credit line, even though the loan is secured by the customer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">15(a) Consumer's right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Occurrences subject to right. Under an open-end credit plan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, the right of rescission generally arises with each of the following occurrences:</p><p class="depth0">Opening the account.</p><p class="depth0">Each credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">Increasing the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">Adding to an existing account a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">Increasing the dollar amount of the security interest taken in the dwelling to secure the plan. For example, a consumer may open an account with a $10,000 credit limit, $5,000 of which is initially secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The consumer has the right to rescind at that time and (except as noted in Sec. 226.15(a)(1)(ii)) with each extension on the account. Later, if the creditor decides that it wants the credit line fully secured, and increases the amount of its interest in the consumer's dwelling, the consumer has the right to rescind the increase.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exceptions. Although the consumer generally has the right to rescind with each transaction on the account, section 125(e) of the Act provides an exception: the creditor need not provide the right to rescind at the time of each credit extension made under an open-end credit plan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling to the extent that the credit extended is in accordance with a previously established credit limit for the plan. This limited rescission option is available whether or not the plan existed prior to the effective date of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">3. Security interest arising from transaction. In order for the right of rescission to apply, the security interest must be retained as part of the credit transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A security interest that is acquired by a contractor who is also extending the credit in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">A mechanic's or materialman's lien that is retained by a subcontractor or supplier of a contractor-creditor, even when the latter has waived its own security interest in the consumer's home.</p><p class="depth0">The security interest is not part of the credit transaction, and therefore the transaction is not subject to the right of rescission when, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A mechanic's or materialman's lien is obtained by a contractor who is not a party to the credit transaction but merely is paid with the proceeds of the consumer's cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">All security interests that may arise in connection with the credit transaction are validly waived.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor obtains a lien and completion bond that in effect satisfies all liens against the consumer's principal dwelling as a result of the credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Although liens arising by operation of law are not considered security interests for purposes of disclosure under Sec. 226.2, that section specifically includes them in the definition for purposes of the right of rescission. Thus, even though an interest in the consumer's

principal dwelling is not a required disclosure under Sec. 226.6(c), it may still give rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumer. To be a consumer within the meaning of Sec. 226.2, that person must at least have an ownership interest in the dwelling that is encumbered by the creditor's security interest, although that person need not be a signatory to the credit agreement. For example, if only one spouse enters into a secured plan, the other spouse is a consumer if the ownership interest of that spouse is subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">5. Principal dwelling. A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time. (But see comment 15(a)(1)-6.) A vacation or other second home would not be a principal dwelling. A transaction secured by a second home (such as a vacation home) that is not currently being used as the consumer's principal dwelling is not rescindable, even if the consumer intends to reside there in the future. When a consumer buys or builds a new dwelling that will become the consumer's principal dwelling within one year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal dwelling if it secures the open-end credit line. In that case, the transaction secured by the new dwelling is a residential mortgage transaction and is not rescindable. For example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, an advance on an open-end line to finance B and secured by B is a residential mortgage transaction. Dwelling, as defined in Sec. 226.2, includes structures that are classified as personalty under state law. For example, a transaction secured by a mobile home, trailer, or houseboat used as the consumer's principal dwelling may be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">6. Special rule for principal dwelling. Notwithstanding the general rule that consumers may have only one principal dwelling, when the consumer is acquiring or constructing a new principal dwelling, a credit plan or extension that is subject to Regulation Z and is secured by the equity in the consumer's current principal dwelling is subject to the right of rescission regardless of the purpose of that loan (for example, an advance to be used as a bridge loan). For example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, a loan to finance B and secured by A is subject to the right of rescission. Moreover, a loan secured by both A and B is, likewise, rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Consumer's exercise of right. The consumer must exercise the right of rescission in writing but not necessarily on the notice supplied under Sec. 226.15(b). Whatever the means of sending the notification of rescission--mail, telegram or other written means--the time period for the creditor's performance under Sec. 226.15(d)(2) does not begin to run until the notification has been received. The creditor may designate an agent to receive the notification so long as the agent's name and address appear on the notice provided to the consumer under Sec. 226.15(b). Where the creditor fails to provide the consumer with a designated address for sending the notification of rescission, delivery of the notification to the person or address to which the consumer has been directed to send payments constitutes delivery to the creditor or assignee. State law determines whether delivery of the notification to a third party other than the person to whom payments are made is delivery to the creditor or assignee, in the case where the creditor fails to designate an address for sending the notification of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15 (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rescission period. the period within which the consumer may exercise the right to rescind runs for 3 business days from the last of 3 events:</p><p class="depth0">The occurrence that gives rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery of all material disclosures that are relevant to the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery to the consumer of the required rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">For example, an account is opened on Friday, June 1, and the disclosures and notice of the right to rescind were given on Thursday, May 31; the rescission period will expire at midnight of the third business day after June 1--that is, Tuesday June 5. In another example, if the disclosures are given and the account is opened on Friday, June 1, and the rescission notice is given on Monday, June 4, the rescission period expires at midnight of the third business day after June 4--that is Thursday, June 7. The consumer must place the rescission notice in the mail, file it for telegraphic transmission, or deliver it to the creditor's place of business within that period in order to exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material disclosures. Footnote 36 sets forth the material disclosures that must be provided before the rescission period can begin to run. The creditor must provide sufficient information to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.6 for these disclosures. A creditor may satisfy this requirement by giving an initial disclosure statement that complies with the regulation. Failure to give the other required initial disclosures (such as the billing rights statement) or the information required under section 226.5b. does not prevent the running of the rescission period, although that failure may result in civil liability or administrative sanctions. The payment terms set forth in footnote 36 apply to any repayment phase set forth in the agreement. Thus, the payment terms described in Sec. 226.6(e)(2) for any repayment phase as well

as for the draw period are ``material disclosures.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Material disclosures--variable rate program. For a variable rate program, the material disclosures also include the disclosures listed in footnote 12 to Sec. 226.6(a)(2): the circumstances under which the rate may increase; the limitations on the increase; and the effect of an increase. The disclosures listed in footnote 12 to section 226.6(a)(2) for any repayment phase also are material disclosures for variable-rate programs.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unexpired right of rescission. When the creditor has failed to take the action necessary to start the three-day rescission period running the right to rescind automatically lapses on the occurrence of the earliest of the following three events:</p><p class="depth0">The expiration of three years after the occurrence giving rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer of all the consumer's interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">Sale of the consumer's interest in the property, including a transaction in which the consumer sells the dwelling and takes back a purchase money note and mortgage or retains legal title through a device such as an installment sale contract.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer of all the consumer's interest includes such transfers as bequests and gifts. A sale or transfer of the property need not be voluntary to terminate the right to rescind. For example, a foreclosure sale would terminate an unexpired right to rescind. As provided in section 125 of the act, the three-year limit may be extended by an administrative proceeding to enforce the provisions of Sec. 226.15. A partial transfer of the consumer's interest, such as a transfer bestowing co-ownership on a spouse, does not terminate the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint owners. When more than one consumer has the right to rescind a transaction, any one of them may exercise that right and cancel the transaction on behalf of all. For example, if both a husband and wife have the right to rescind a transaction, either spouse acting alone may exercise the right and both are bound by the rescission.</p><p class="depth0">15(b) Notice of right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">1. Who receives notice. Each consumer entitled to rescind must be given:</p><p class="depth0">Two copies of the rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">The material disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">In a transaction involving joint owners, both of whom are entitled to rescind, both must receive the notice of the right to rescind and disclosures. For example, if both spouses are entitled to rescind a transaction, each must receive two copies of the rescission notice (one copy to each if the notice is provided in electronic form in accordance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act) and one copy of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. The rescission notice may be physically separated from the material disclosures or combined with the material disclosures, so long as the information required to be included on the notice is set forth in a clear and conspicuous manner. See the model notices in appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content. The notice must include all of the information outlined in Sec. 226.15(b)(1) through (5). The requirement in Sec. 226.15(b) that the transaction or occurrence be identified may be met by providing the date of the transaction or occurrence. The notice may include additional information related to the required information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A description of the property subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">A statement that joint owners may have the right to rescind and that a rescission by one is effective for all.</p><p class="depth0">The name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive notice of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Time of providing notice. The notice required by Sec. 226.15(b) need not be given before the occurrence giving rise to the right of rescission. The creditor may deliver the notice after the occurrence, but the rescission period will not begin to run until the notice is given. For example, if the creditor provides the notice on May 15, but disclosures were given and the credit limit was raised on May 10, the 3-business-day rescission period will run from May 15.</p><p class="depth0">15(c) Delay of creditor's performance.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Until the rescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded, the creditor must not, either directly or through a third party:</p><p class="depth0">Disburse advances to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Begin performing services for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Deliver materials to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">A creditor may, however, continue to allow transactions under an existing open-end credit plan during a rescission period that results solely from the addition of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling. (See comment 15(c)-3 for other actions that may be taken during the delay period.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Escrow. The creditor may disburse advances during the rescission period in a valid escrow arrangement. The creditor may not, however, appoint the consumer as ``trustee'' or ``escrow agent'' and distribute funds to the consumer in that capacity during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Actions during the delay period. Section 226.15(c) does not prevent the creditor from taking other steps during the delay, short of beginning actual performance. Unless otherwise prohibited, such as by state law, the creditor may, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Prepare the cash advance check.</p><p class="depth0">Perfect the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">Accrue finance charges during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Performance by third party. The creditor is relieved from liability for failure to delay performance if a third party with no knowledge that the rescission right has been activated provides materials or services, as long as any debt incurred for materials or services obtained by the consumer during the rescission period is not secured by the security interest in the consumer's dwelling. For example, if a consumer uses a bank credit card to purchase materials from a merchant in an amount below the floor limit, the merchant might not contact the card issuer for authorization and therefore would not know that materials should not be provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Delay beyond rescission period. The creditor must wait until it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself by doing one of the following:</p><p class="depth0">Waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the rescission period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice.</p><p class="depth0">Obtaining a written statement from the consumer that the right has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">When more than one consumer has the right to rescind, the creditor cannot reasonably rely on the assurance of only one consumer, because other consumers may exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">15(d) Effects of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination of security interest. Any security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void when the consumer exercises the right of rescission. The security interest is automatically negated, regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected. Under Sec. 226.15(d)(2), however, the creditor must take any action necessary to reflect the fact that the security interest no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">2. Extent of termination. The creditor's security interest is void to the extent that it is related to the occurrence giving rise to the right of rescission. For example, upon rescission:</p><p class="depth0">If the consumer's right to rescind is activated by the opening of a plan, any security interest in the principal dwelling is void.</p><p class="depth0">If the right arises due to an increase in the credit limit, the security interest is void as to the amount of credit extensions over the prior limit, but the security interest in amounts up to the original credit limit is unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">If the right arises with each individual credit extension, then the interest is void as to that extension, and other extensions are unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Refunds to consumer. The consumer cannot be required to pay any amount in the form of money or property either to the creditor or to a third party as part of the occurrence subject to the right of rescission. Any amounts of this nature already paid by the consumer must be refunded. ``Any amount'' includes finance charges already accrued, as well as other charges such as broker fees, application and commitment fees, or fees for a title search or appraisal, whether paid to the creditor, paid by the consumer directly to a third party, or passed on from the creditor to the third party. It is irrelevant that these amounts may not represent profit to the creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">If the occurrence is the opening of the plan, the creditor must return any membership or application fee paid.</p><p class="depth0">If the occurrence is the increase in a credit limit or the addition of a security interest, the creditor must return any fee imposed for a new credit report or filing fees.</p><p class="depth0">If the occurrence is a credit extension, the creditors must return fees such as application, title, and appraisal or survey fees, as well as any finance charges related to the credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts not refundable to consumer. Creditors need not return any money given by the consumer to a third party outside of the occurrence, such as costs incurred for a building permit or for a zoning variance. Similarly, the term any amount does not apply to money or property given by the creditor to the consumer; those amounts must be tendered by the consumer to the creditor under Sec. 226.15(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reflection of security interest termination. The creditor must take whatever steps are necessary to indicate that the security interest is terminated. Those steps include the cancellation of documents creating the security interest, and the filing of release or termination statements in the public record. In a transaction involving subcontractors or suppliers that also hold security interests related to the occurrence rescinded by the consumer, the creditor must insure that the termination of their security interests is also reflected. The 20-day period for the creditor's action refers to the time within which the creditor must begin the process. It does not require all necessary steps to have been completed within that time, but the creditor is responsible for seeing the process through to completion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Property exchange. Once the creditor has fulfilled its obligation under Sec. 226.15(d)(2), the consumer must tender to the creditor any property or money the creditor has already delivered to the consumer. At the consumer's option, property may be tendered at the location of the property. For example, if fixtures or furniture have been delivered to the consumer's home, the consumer may

tender them to the creditor by making them available for pick-up at the home, rather than physically returning them to the creditor's premises. Money already given to the consumer must be tendered at the creditor's place of business. For purpose of property exchange, the following additional rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">A cash advance is considered money for purposes of this section even if the creditor knows what the consumer intends to purchase with the money.</p><p class="depth0">In a 3-party open-end credit plan (that is, if the creditor and seller are not the same or related persons), extensions by the creditor that are used by the consumer for purchases from third-party sellers are considered to be the same as cash advances for purposes of tendering value to the creditor, even though the transaction is a purchase for other purposes under the regulation. For example, if a consumer exercises the unexpired right to rescind after using a 3-party credit card for one year, the consumer would tender the amount of the purchase price for the items charged to the account, rather than tendering the items themselves to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable value. If returning the property would be extremely burdensome to the consumer, the consumer may offer the creditor its reasonable value rather than returning the property itself. For example, if building materials have already been incorporated into the consumer's dwelling, the consumer may pay their reasonable value.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Modifications. The procedures outlined in Sec. 226.15(d)(2) and (3) may be modified by a court. For example, when a consumer is in bankruptcy proceedings and prohibited from returning anything to the creditor, or when the equities dictate, a modification might be made. The sequence of procedures under Sec. 226.15(d)(2) and (3), or a court's modification of those procedures under Sec. 226.15(d)(4), does not affect a consumer's substantive right to rescind and to have the loan amount adjusted accordingly. Where the consumer's right to rescind is contested by the creditor, a court would normally determine whether the consumer has a right to rescind and determine the amounts owed before establishing the procedures for the parties to tender any money or property.</p><p class="depth0">15(e) Consumer's waiver of right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">1. Need for waiver. To waive the right to rescind, the consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that must be met before the end of the rescission period. The existence of the consumer's waiver will not, of itself, automatically insulate the creditor from liability for failing to provide the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure. To waive or modify the right to rescind, the consumer must give a written statement that specifically waives or modifies the right, and also includes a brief description of the emergency. Each consumer entitled to rescind must sign the waiver statement. In a transaction involving multiple consumers, such as a husband and wife using their home as collateral, the waiver must bear the signatures of both spouses.</p><p class="depth0">15(f) Exempt transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Residential mortgage transaction. Although residential mortgage transactions would seldom be made on bona fide open-end credit plans (under which repeated transactions must be reasonably contemplated), an advance on an open-end plan could be for a downpayment for the purchase of a dwelling that would then secure the remainder of the line. In such a case, only the particular advance for the downpayment would be exempt from the rescission right.</p><p class="depth0">2. State creditors. Cities and other political subdivisions of states acting as creditors are not exempt from Sec. 226.15.</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. When the creditor holds a mortgage or deed of trust on the consumer's principal dwelling and that mortgage or deed of trust contains a ``spreader clause'' (also known as a ``dragnet'' or cross-collateralization clause), subsequent occurrences such as the opening of a plan or individual credit extensions are subject to the right of rescission to the same degree as if the security interest were taken directly to secure the open-end plan, unless the creditor effectively waives its security interest under the spreader clause with respect to the subsequent open-end credit extensions.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 113, 125, 130, and the Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984, Sec. 205 (Pub. L. 98-479).</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.2 and appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.9.</p><p class="depth0">1981 Changes: Section 226.15 reflects the statutory amendments of 1980, providing for a limited right of rescission when individual credit extensions are made in accordance with a previously established credit limit for an open-end credit plan. The 1980 amendments provided that this limited rescission right be available for a three-year trial period. However, Pub. L. 98-479 now permanently exempts such individual credit extensions from the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">The right to rescind applies not only to real property used as the consumer's principal dwelling, but to personal property as well. The regulation provides no specific text or format for the rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">When a consumer exercises the right to rescind, the creditor now has 20 days to return a consumer's money or property and take the necessary action to terminate the security interest. The creditor has 20 days to take possession of the money or property

after the consumer's tender before the consumer may keep it without further obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Under the revised regulation, the waiver provision has been relaxed. The lien status of the mortgage is irrelevant for purposes of the residential mortgage transaction exemption. The exemption for agricultural loans from the right to rescind has been deleted.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.16--Advertising</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard--general. Section 226.16 is subject to the general ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for subpart B (see Sec. 226.5(a)(1)) but prescribes no specific rules for the format of the necessary disclosures, other than the format requirements related to the disclosure of a promotional rate or payment under Sec. 226.16(d)(6), a promotional rate or promotional fee under Sec. 226.16(g), or a deferred interest or similar offer under Sec. 226.16(h). Other than the disclosure of certain terms described in Sec. Sec. 226.16(d)(6), (g), or (h), the credit terms need not be printed in a certain type size nor need they appear in any particular place in the advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard--promotional rates or payments; deferred interest or similar offers. i. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(d)(6), a clear and conspicuous disclosure means that the required information in Sec. 226.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is disclosed with equal prominence and in close proximity to the promotional rate or payment to which it applies. If the information in Sec. 226.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the promotional rate or payment to which it applies, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent and in close proximity. Notwithstanding the above, for electronic advertisements that disclose promotional rates or payments, compliance with the requirements of Sec. 226.16(c) is deemed to satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(g)(4) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means the required information in Sec. 226.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) must be equally prominent to the promotional rate or promotional fee to which it applies. If the information in Sec. 226.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) is the same type size as the promotional rate or promotional fee to which it applies, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(h)(3) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means the required information in Sec. 226.16(h)(3) must be equally prominent to each statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period. If the information required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.16(h)(3) is the same type size as the statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period, the disclosure would be deemed to be equally prominent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard--Internet advertisements for home-equity plans. For purposes of this section, a clear and conspicuous disclosure for visual text advertisements on the Internet for home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b means that the required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other devices and comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures under Sec. 226.16(d). (See also comment 16(c)(1)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Clear and conspicuous standard--televised advertisements for home-equity plans. For purposes of this section, including alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 226.16(e), a clear and conspicuous disclosure in the context of visual text advertisements on television for home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b means that the required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other devices, are displayed in a manner that allows for a consumer to read the information required to be disclosed, and comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures under Sec. 226.16(d). For example, very fine print in a television advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clear and conspicuous standard--oral advertisements for home-equity plans. For purposes of this section, including alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 226.16(e), a clear and conspicuous disclosure in the context of an oral advertisement for home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, whether by radio, television, the Internet, or other medium, means that the required disclosures are given at a speed and volume sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them. For example, information stated very rapidly at a low volume in a radio or television advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot hear and comprehend the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">6. Expressing the annual percentage rate in abbreviated form. Whenever the annual percentage rate is used in an advertisement for open-end credit, it may be expressed using a readily understandable abbreviation such as APR.</p><p class="depth0">7. Effective date. For guidance on the applicability of the Board's revisions to Sec. 226.16 published on July 30, 2008, see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">16(a) Actually available terms.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. To the extent that an advertisement mentions specific credit terms, it may state only those terms that the creditor is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not advertise a very low annual percentage rate that will not in fact be available at any time. Section 226.16(a) is not intended to inhibit the promotion of new credit programs, but to bar the advertising of terms that are not and will not be available. For example, a creditor may advertise terms that will be offered for only a limited period, or terms that will become available at a future date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific credit terms. Specific credit terms is not limited to the disclosures required by the regulation but would include any specific components of a credit plan, such as the minimum periodic payment amount or seller's points in a plan secured by real estate.</p><p class="depth0">16(b) Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Triggering terms. Negative as well as affirmative references trigger the requirement for additional information. For example, if a creditor states no interest or no annual membership fee in an advertisement, additional information must be provided. Other examples of terms that trigger additional disclosures are:</p><p class="depth0">i. Small monthly service charge on the remaining balance, which describes how the amount of a finance charge will be determined.</p><p class="depth0">ii. 12 percent Annual Percentage Rate or A $15 annual membership fee buys you $2,000 in credit, which describe required disclosures under Sec. 226.6.</p><p class="depth0">2. Implicit terms. Section 226.16(b) applies even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly, but may be readily determined from the advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Membership fees. A membership fee is not a triggering term nor need it be disclosed under Sec. 226.16(b)(1)(iii) if it is required for participation in the plan whether or not an open-end credit feature is attached. (See comment 6(a)(2)-1 and Sec. 226.6(b)(3)(iii)(B).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Deferred billing and deferred payment programs. Statements such as ``Charge it--you won't be billed until May'' or ``You may skip your January payment'' are not in themselves triggering terms, since the timing for initial billing or for monthly payments are not terms required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6. However, a statement such as ``No interest charges until May'' or any other statement regarding when interest or finance charges begin to accrue is a triggering term, whether appearing alone or in conjunction with a description of a deferred billing or deferred payment program such as the examples above.</p><p class="depth0">5. Variable-rate plans. In disclosing the annual percentage rate in an advertisement for a variable-rate plan, as required by Sec. 226.16(b)(1)(ii), the creditor may use an insert showing the current rate; or may give the rate as of a specified recent date. The additional requirement in Sec. 226.16(b)(1)(ii) to disclose the variable-rate feature may be satisfied by disclosing that the annual percentage rate may vary or a similar statement, but the advertisement need not include the information required by Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) or (b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Membership fees for open-end (not home-secured) plans. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(b)(1)(iii), membership fees that may be imposed on open-end (not home-secured) plans shall have the same meaning as in Sec. 226.5a(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumptions. In stating the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation, assuming that the consumer pays only the periodic payment amounts advertised, as required under Sec. 226.16(b)(2), the following additional assumptions may be made:</p><p class="depth0">i. Payments are made timely so as not to be considered late by the creditor;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments are made each period, and no debt cancellation or suspension agreement, or skip payment feature applies to the account;</p><p class="depth0">iii. No interest rate changes will affect the account;</p><p class="depth0">iv. No other balances are currently carried or will be carried on the account;</p><p class="depth0">v. No taxes or ancillary charges are or will be added to the obligation;</p><p class="depth0">vi. Goods or services are delivered on a single date; and</p><p class="depth0">vii. The consumer is not currently and will not become delinquent on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Positive periodic payment amounts. Only positive periodic payment amounts trigger the additional disclosures under Sec. 226.16(b)(2). Therefore, if the periodic payment amount advertised is not a positive amount (e.g., ``No payments''), the advertisement need not state the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">16(c) Catalogs or other multiple-page advertisements; electronic advertisements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The multiple-page advertisements to which Sec. 226.16(c) refers are advertisements consisting of a series of sequentially numbered pages--for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing consisting of several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single envelope does not constitute a single multiple-page advertisement for purposes of Sec. 226.16(c).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.16(c)(1) permits creditors to put credit information together in one place in a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site). The rule applies only if the advertisement contains one or more of the triggering terms from Sec. 226.16(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic advertisement. If an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) contains the table or schedule permitted under Sec. 226.16(c)(1), any statement of terms set forth in Sec. 226.6 appearing anywhere else in the advertisement must clearly direct the consumer to the location where the table or schedule begins. For example, a term triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly takes the consumer to the additional information.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Table or schedule if credit terms depend on outstanding balance. If the credit terms of a plan vary depending on the amount of the balance outstanding, rather than the amount of any property purchased, a table or schedule complies with Sec. 226.16(c)(2) if it includes the required disclosures for representative balances. For example, a creditor would disclose that a periodic rate of 1.5% is applied to balances of $500 or less, and a 1% rate is applied to balances greater than $500.</p><p class="depth0">16(d) Additional requirements for home-equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Trigger terms. Negative as well as affirmative references trigger the requirement for additional information. For example, if a creditor states no annual fee, no points, or we waive closing costs in an advertisement, additional information must be provided. (See comment 16(d)-4 regarding the use of a phrase such as no closing costs.) Inclusion of a statement such as low fees, however, would not trigger the need to state additional information. References to payment terms include references to the draw period or any repayment period, to the length of the plan, to how the minimum payments are determined and to the timing of such payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees to open the plan. Section 226.16(d)(1)(i) requires a disclosure of any fees imposed by the creditor or a third party to open the plan. In providing the fee information required under this paragraph, the corresponding rules for disclosure of this information apply. For example, fees to open the plan may be stated as a range. Similarly, if property insurance is required to open the plan, a creditor either may estimate the cost of the insurance or provide a statement that such insurance is required. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5b(d)(7) and (d)(8).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Statements of tax deductibility. An advertisement that refers to deductibility for tax purposes is not misleading if it includes a statement such as ``consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of interest.'' An advertisement distributed in paper form or through the Internet (rather than by radio or television) that states that the advertised extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the consumer's dwelling is not misleading if it clearly and conspicuously states the required information in Sec. Sec. 226.16(d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Misleading terms prohibited. Under Sec. 226.16(d)(5), advertisements may not refer to home-equity plans as free money or use other misleading terms. For example, an advertisement could not state ``no closing costs'' or ``we waive closing costs'' if consumers may be required to pay any closing costs, such as recordation fees. In the case of property insurance, however, a creditor may state, for example, ``no closing costs'' even if property insurance may be required, as long as the creditor also provides a statement that such insurance may be required. (See the commentary to this section regarding fees to open a plan.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Promotional rates and payments in advertisements for home-equity plans. Section 226.16(d)(6) requires additional disclosures for promotional rates or payments.</p><p class="depth0">i. Variable-rate plans. In advertisements for variable-rate plans, if the advertised annual percentage rate is based on (or the advertised payment is derived from) the index and margin that will be used to make rate (or payment) adjustments over the term of the loan, then there is no promotional rate or promotional payment. If, however, the advertised annual percentage rate is not based on (or the advertised payment is not derived from) the index and margin that will be used to make rate (or payment) adjustments, and a reasonably current application of the index and margin would result in a higher annual percentage rate (or, given an assumed balance, a higher payment) then there is a promotional rate or promotional payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Equal prominence, close proximity. Information required to be disclosed in Sec. 226.16(d)(6)(ii) that is immediately next to or directly above or below the promotional rate or payment (but not in a footnote) is deemed to be closely proximate to the listing. Information required to be disclosed in Sec. 226.16(d)(6)(ii) that is in the same type size as the promotional rate or payment is deemed to be equally prominent.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amounts and time periods of payments. Section 226.16(d)(6)(ii)(C) requires disclosure of the amount and time periods of any payments that will apply under the plan. This section may require disclosure of several payment amounts, including any balloon payment. For example, if an advertisement for a home-equity plan offers a $100,000 five-year line of credit and assumes that the entire line is drawn resulting in a minimum payment of $800 per month for the first six months, increasing to $1,000 per month after month six, followed by a $50,000 balloon payment after five years, the advertisement must disclose the amount and time period of each of the two monthly payment streams, as well as the amount and timing of the balloon payment, with equal prominence and in close proximity to the promotional payment. However, if the final payment could not be

more than twice the amount of other minimum payments, the final payment need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Plans other than variable-rate plans. For a plan other than a variable-rate plan, if an advertised payment is calculated in the same way as other payments based on an assumed balance, the fact that the minimum payment could increase solely if the consumer made an additional draw does not make the payment a promotional payment. For example, if a payment of $500 results from an assumed $10,000 draw, and the payment would increase to $1,000 if the consumer made an additional $10,000 draw, the payment is not a promotional payment.</p><p class="depth0">v. Conversion option. Some home-equity plans permit the consumer to repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period. The fixed-rate conversion option does not, by itself, make the rate or payment that would apply if the consumer exercised the fixed-rate conversion option a promotional rate or payment.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Preferred-rate provisions. Some home-equity plans contain a preferred-rate provision, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as the consumer-employee leaving the creditor's employ, the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor, or the consumer revoking an election to make automated payments. A preferred-rate provision does not, by itself, make the rate or payment under the preferred-rate provision a promotional rate or payment.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonably current index and margin. For the purposes of this section, an index and margin is considered reasonably current if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For direct mail advertisements, it was in effect within 60 days before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For advertisements in electronic form it was in effect within 30 days before the advertisement is sent to a consumer's e-mail address, or in the case of an advertisement made on an Internet Web site, when viewed by the public; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. For printed advertisements made available to the general public, including ones contained in a catalog, magazine, or other generally available publication, it was in effect within 30 days before printing.</p><p class="depth0">7. Relation to other sections. Advertisements for home-equity plans must comply with all provisions in Sec. 226.16, not solely the rules in Sec. 226.16(d). If an advertisement contains information (such as the payment terms) that triggers the duty under Sec. 226.16(d) to state the annual percentage rate, the additional disclosures in Sec. 226.16(b) must be provided in the advertisement. While Sec. 226.16(d) does not require a statement of fees to use or maintain the plan (such as membership fees and transaction charges), such fees must be disclosed under Sec. 226.16(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">8. Inapplicability of closed-end rules. Advertisements for home-equity plans are governed solely by the requirements in Sec. 226.16, except Sec. 226.16(g), and not by the closed-end advertising rules in Sec. 226.24. Thus, if a creditor states payment information about the repayment phase, this will trigger the duty to provide additional information under Sec. 226.16, but not under Sec. 226.24.</p><p class="depth0">9. Balloon payment. See comment 5b(d)(5)(ii)-3 for information not required to be stated in advertisements, and on situations in which the balloon payment requirement does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">16(e) Alternative disclosures--television or radio advertisements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multi-purpose telephone number. When an advertised telephone number provides a recording, disclosures must be provided early in the sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures. For example, in providing several options--such as providing directions to the advertiser's place of business--the option allowing the consumer to request disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by other information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement accompanying toll free number. Language must accompany a telephone number indicating that disclosures are available by calling the telephone number, such as ``call 1-800-000-0000 for details about credit costs and terms.''</p><p class="depth0">16(g) Promotional rates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate in effect at the end of the promotional period. If the annual percentage rate that will be in effect at the end of the promotional period (i.e., the post-promotional rate) is a variable rate, the post-promotional rate for purposes of Sec. 226.16(g)(2)(i) is the rate that would have applied at the time the promotional rate was advertised if the promotional rate was not offered, consistent with the accuracy requirements in Sec. 226.5a(c)(2) and (e)(4), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Immediate proximity. For written or electronic advertisements, including the term ``introductory'' or ``intro'' in the same phrase as the listing of the introductory rate or introductory fee is deemed to be in immediate proximity of the listing.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prominent location closely proximate. For written or electronic advertisements, information required to be disclosed in Sec. 226.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) that is in the same paragraph as the first listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee is deemed to be in a prominent location closely proximate to the listing. Information disclosed in a footnote will not be considered in a prominent location closely proximate to the listing.</p><p class="depth0">4. First listing. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(g)(4) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements, the first listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee is the most

prominent listing of the rate or fee on the front side of the first page of the principal promotional document. The principal promotional document is the document designed to be seen first by the consumer in a mailing, such as a cover letter or solicitation letter. If the promotional rate or promotional fee does not appear on the front side of the first page of the principal promotional document, then the first listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee is the most prominent listing of the rate or fee on the subsequent pages of the principal promotional document. If the promotional rate or promotional fee is not listed on the principal promotional document or there is no principal promotional document, the first listing is the most prominent listing of the rate or fee on the front side of the first page of each document listing the promotional rate or promotional fee. If the promotional rate or promotional fee does not appear on the front side of the first page of a document, then the first listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee is the most prominent listing of the rate or fee on the subsequent pages of the document. If the listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee with the largest type size on the front side of the first page (or subsequent pages if the promotional rate or promotional fee is not listed on the front side of the first page) of the principal promotional document (or each document listing the promotional rate or promotional fee if the promotional rate or promotional fee is not listed on the principal promotional document or there is no principal promotional document) is used as the most prominent listing, it will be deemed to be the first listing. Consistent with comment 16(c)-1, a catalog or multiple-page advertisement is considered one document for purposes of Sec. 226.16(g)(4).</p><p class="depth0">5. Post-promotional rate depends on consumer's creditworthiness. For purposes of disclosing the rate that may apply after the end of the promotional rate period, at the advertiser's option, the advertisement may disclose the rates that may apply as either specific rates, or a range of rates. For example, if there are three rates that may apply (9.99%, 12.99% or 17.99%), an issuer may disclose these three rates as specific rates (9.99%, 12.99% or 17.99%) or as a range of rates (9.99%-17.99%).</p><p class="depth0">16(h) Deferred interest or similar offers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest or similar offers clarified. Deferred interest or similar offers do not include offers that allow a consumer to skip payments during a specified period of time, and under which the consumer is not obligated under any circumstances for any interest or other finance charges that could be attributable to that period. Deferred interest or similar offers also do not include 0% annual percentage rate offers where a consumer is not obligated under any circumstances for interest attributable to the time period the 0% annual percentage rate was in effect, though such offers may be considered promotional rates under Sec. 226.16(g)(2)(i). Deferred interest or similar offers also do not include skip payment programs that have no required minimum payment for one or more billing cycles but where interest continues to accrue and is imposed during that period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred interest period clarified. Although the terms of an advertised deferred interest or similar offer may provide that a creditor may charge the accrued interest if the balance is not paid in full by a certain date, creditors sometimes have an informal policy or practice that delays charging the accrued interest for payment received a brief period of time after the date upon which a creditor has the contractual right to charge the accrued interest. The advertisement need not include the end of an informal ``courtesy period'' in disclosing the deferred interest period under Sec. 226.16(h)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Immediate proximity. For written or electronic advertisements, including the deferred interest period in the same phrase as the statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' or ``same as cash'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period is deemed to be in immediate proximity of the statement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prominent location closely proximate. For written or electronic advertisements, information required to be disclosed in Sec. 226.16(h)(4)(i) and (ii) that is in the same paragraph as the first statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' or ``same as cash'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period is deemed to be in a prominent location closely proximate to the statement. Information disclosed in a footnote is not considered in a prominent location closely proximate to the statement.</p><p class="depth0">5. First listing. For purposes of Sec. 226.16(h)(4) as it applies to written or electronic advertisements, the first statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period is the most prominent listing of one of these statements on the front side of the first page of the principal promotional document. The principal promotional document is the document designed to be seen first by the consumer in a mailing, such as a cover letter or solicitation letter. If one of the statements does not appear on the front side of the first page of the principal promotional document, then the first listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of a statement on the subsequent pages of the principal promotional document. If one of the statements is not

listed on the principal promotional document or there is no principal promotional document, the first listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of the statement on the front side of the first page of each document containing one of these statements. If one of the statements does not appear on the front side of the first page of a document, then the first listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of a statement on the subsequent pages of the document. If the listing of one of these statements with the largest type size on the front side of the first page (or subsequent pages if one of these statements is not listed on the front side of the first page) of the principal promotional document (or each document listing one of these statements if a statement is not listed on the principal promotional document or there is no principal promotional document) is used as the most prominent listing, it will be deemed to be the first listing. Consistent with comment 16(c)-1, a catalog or multiple-page advertisement is considered one document for purposes of Sec. 226.16(h)(4).</p><p class="depth0">6. Additional information. Consistent with comment 5(a)-2, the information required under Sec. 226.16(h)(4) need not be segregated from other information regarding the deferred interest or similar offer. Advertisements may also be required to provide additional information pursuant to Sec. 226.16(b) though such information need not be integrated with the information required under Sec. 226.16(h)(4).</p><p class="depth0">7. Examples. Examples of disclosures that could be used to comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.16(h)(3) include: ``no interest if paid in full within 6 months'' and ``no interest if paid in full by December 31, 2010.''</p><p class="depth0">Subpart C--Closed-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.17--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">17(a) Form of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous. This standard requires that disclosures be in a reasonably understandable form. For example, while the regulation requires no mathematical progression or format, the disclosures must be presented in a way that does not obscure the relationship of the terms to each other. In addition, although no minimum type size is mandated (except for the interest rate and payment summary for mortgage transactions required by Sec. 228.18(s)), the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Segregation of disclosures. The disclosures may be grouped together and segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from other information on the contract or other documents:</p><p class="depth0">By outlining them in a box</p><p class="depth0">By bold print dividing lines</p><p class="depth0">By a different color background</p><p class="depth0">By a different type style
(The general segregation requirement described in this subparagraph does not apply to the disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 226.19(b) and 226.20(c) although the disclosures must be clear and conspicuous.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Location. The regulation imposes no specific location requirements on the segregated disclosures. For example:</p><p class="depth0">They may appear on a disclosure statement separate from all other material.</p><p class="depth0">They may be placed on the same document with the credit contract or other information, so long as they are segregated from that information.</p><p class="depth0">They may be shown on the front or back of a document.</p><p class="depth0">They need not begin at the top of a page.</p><p class="depth0">They may be continued from one page to another.</p><p class="depth0">4. Content of segregated disclosures. Footnotes 37 and 38 contain exceptions to the requirement that the disclosures under Sec. 226.18 be segregated from material that is not directly related to those disclosures. Footnote 37 lists the items that may be added to the segregated disclosures, even though not directly related to those disclosures. Footnote 38 lists the items required under Sec. 226.18 that may be deleted from the segregated disclosures and appear elsewhere. Any one or more of these additions or deletions may be combined and appear either together with or separate from the segregated disclosures. The itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c), however, must be separate from the other segregated disclosures under Sec. 226.18, except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47. If a creditor chooses to include the security interest charges required to be itemized under Sec. 226.4(e) and Sec. 226.18(o) in the amount financed itemization, it need not list these charges elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">5. Directly related. The segregated disclosures may, at the creditor's option, include any information that is directly related to those disclosures. The following is directly related information:</p><p class="depth0">i. A description of a grace period after which a late payment charge will be imposed. For example, the disclosure given under Sec. 226.18(l) may state that a late charge will apply to ``any payment received more than 15 days after the due date.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. A statement that the transaction is not secured. For example, the creditor may add a category labelled ``unsecured'' or ``not secured'' to the security interest disclosures given under Sec. 226.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The basis for any estimates used in making disclosures. For example, if the maturity date of a loan depends solely on the

occurrence of a future event, the creditor may indicate that the disclosures assume that event will occur at a certain time.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The conditions under which a demand feature may be exercised. For example, in a loan subject to demand after five years, the disclosures may state that the loan will become payable on demand in five years.</p><p class="depth0">v. An explanation of the use of pronouns or other references to the parties to the transaction. For example, the disclosures may state, ```You' refers to the customer and `we' refers to the creditor.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Instructions to the creditor or its employees on the use of a multiple-purpose form. For example, the disclosures may state, ``Check box if applicable.''</p><p class="depth0">vii. A statement that the borrower may pay a minimum finance charge upon prepayment in a simple-interest transaction. For example, when state law prohibits penalties, but would allow a minimum finance charge in the event of prepayment, the creditor may make the Sec. 226.18(k)(1) disclosure by stating, ``You may be charged a minimum finance charge.''</p><p class="depth0">viii. A brief reference to negative amortization in variable-rate transactions. For example, in the variable-rate disclosure, the creditor may include a short statement such as ``Unpaid interest will be added to principal.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iii).)</p><p class="depth0">ix. A brief caption identifying the disclosures. For example, the disclosures may bear a general title such as ``Federal Truth in Lending Disclosures'' or a descriptive title such as ``Real Estate Loan Disclosures.''</p><p class="depth0">x. A statement that a due-on-sale clause or other conditions on assumption are contained in the loan document. For example, the disclosure given under Sec. 226.18(q) may state, ``Someone buying your home may, subject to conditions in the due-on-sale clause contained in the loan document, assume the remainder of the mortgage on the original terms.''</p><p class="depth0">xi. If a state or Federal law prohibits prepayment penalties and excludes the charging of interest after prepayment from coverage as a penalty, a statement that the borrower may have to pay interest for some period after prepayment in full. The disclosure given under Sec. 226.18(k) may state, for example, ``If you prepay your loan on other than the regular installment date, you may be assessed interest charges until the end of the month.''</p><p class="depth0">xii. More than one hypothetical example under Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iv) in transactions with more than one variable-rate feature. For example, in a variable-rate transaction with an option permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-rate transaction, the disclosures may include an example illustrating the effects on the payment terms of an increase resulting from conversion in addition to the example illustrating an increase resulting from changes in the index.</p><p class="depth0">xiii. The disclosures set forth under Sec. 226.18(f)(1) for variable-rate transactions subject to Sec. 226.18(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">xiv. A statement whether or not a subsequent purchaser of the property securing an obligation may be permitted to assume the remaining obligation on its original terms.</p><p class="depth0">xv. A late-payment fee disclosure under Sec. 226.18(l) on a single payment loan.</p><p class="depth0">xvi. The notice set forth in Sec. 226.19(a)(4), in a closed-end transaction not subject to Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i). In a mortgage transaction subject to Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i), the creditor must disclose the notice contained in Sec. 226.19(a)(4) grouped together with the disclosures made under Sec. 226.18. See comment 19(a)(4)-1.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple-purpose forms. The creditor may design a disclosure statement that can be used for more than one type of transaction, so long as the required disclosures for individual transactions are clear and conspicuous. (See the Commentary to appendices G and H for a discussion of the treatment of disclosures that do not apply to specific transactions.) Any disclosure listed in Sec. 226.18 (except the itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c) for transactions other than private education loans) may be included on a standard disclosure statement even though not all of the creditor's transactions include those features. For example, the statement may include:</p><p class="depth0">The variable rate disclosure under Sec. 226.18(f).</p><p class="depth0">The demand feature disclosure under Sec. 226.18(i).</p><p class="depth0">A reference to the possibility of a security interest arising from a spreader clause, under Sec. 226.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">The assumption policy disclosure under Sec. 226.18(q).</p><p class="depth0">The required deposit disclosure under Sec. 226.18(r).</p><p class="depth0">7. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M, but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens and benefits of ownership upon consummation. These transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of

this regulation instead of Regulation M. Creditors should not include in the segregated Truth in Lending disclosures additional information. Thus, disclosures should show the large final payment in the payment schedule and should not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer at maturity.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. The following rules apply to the requirement that the terms ``annual percentage rate'' (except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47) and ``finance charge'' be shown more conspicuously:</p><p class="depth0">The terms must be more conspicuous only in relation to the other required disclosures under Sec. 226.18. For example, when the disclosures are included on the contract document, those two terms need not be more conspicuous as compared to the heading on the contract document or information required by state law.</p><p class="depth0">The terms need not be more conspicuous except as part of the finance charge and annual percentage rate disclosures under Sec. 226.18 (d) and (e), although they may, at the creditor's option, be highlighted wherever used in the required disclosures. For example, the terms may, but need not, be highlighted when used in disclosing a prepayment penalty under Sec. 226.18(k) or a required deposit under Sec. 226.18(r).</p><p class="depth0">The creditor's identity under Sec. 226.18(a) may, but need not, be more prominently displayed than the finance charge and annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">The terms need not be more conspicuous than figures (including, for example, numbers, percentages, and dollar signs).</p><p class="depth0">2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. The terms ``finance charge'' and (except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 226.47) ``annual percentage rate'' may be made more conspicuous in any way that highlights them in relation to the other required disclosures. For example, they may be:</p><p class="depth0">Capitalized when other disclosures are printed in capital and lower case.</p><p class="depth0">Printed in larger type, bold print or different type face.</p><p class="depth0">Printed in a contrasting color.</p><p class="depth0">Underlined.</p><p class="depth0">Set off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">17(b) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation. As a general rule, disclosures must be made before ``consummation'' of the transaction. The disclosures need not be given by any particular time before consummation, except in certain mortgage transactions and variable-rate transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year under Sec. 226.19, and in private education loan transactions disclosed in compliance with Sec. Sec. 226.46 and 226.47. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(13) regarding the definition of consummation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Converting open-end to closed-end credit. Except for home equity plans subject to Sec. 226.5b in which the agreement provides for a repayment phase, if an open-end credit account is converted to a closed-end transaction under a written agreement with the consumer, the creditor must provide a set of closed-end credit disclosures before consummation of the closed-end transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.19(b) for the timing rules for additional disclosures required upon the conversion to a variable-rate transaction secured by a consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year.) If consummation of the closed-end transaction occurs at the same time as the consumer enters into the open-end agreement, the closed-end credit disclosures may be given at the time of conversion. If disclosures are delayed until conversion and the closed-end transaction has a variable-rate feature, disclosures should be based on the rate in effect at the time of conversion. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.5 regarding conversion of closed-end to open-end credit.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosures provided on credit contracts. Creditors must give the required disclosures to the consumer in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep, before consummation of the transaction. See Sec. 226.17(a)(1) and (b). Sometimes the disclosures are placed on the same document with the credit contract. Creditors are not required to give the consumer two separate copies of the document before consummation, one for the consumer to keep and a second copy for the consumer to execute. The disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a copy of the document containing the unexecuted credit contract and disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the consumer receives a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated. It is not sufficient for the creditor merely to show the consumer the document containing the disclosures before the consumer signs and becomes obligated. The consumer must be free to take possession of and review the document in its entirety before signing.</p><p class="depth0">i. Example. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">A. A creditor gives a consumer a multiple-copy form containing a credit agreement and TILA disclosures. The consumer reviews and signs the form and returns it to the creditor, who separates the copies and gives one copy to the consumer to keep. The creditor has satisfied the disclosure requirement.</p><p class="depth0">17(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures shall reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound as of the outset of the

transaction. In the case of disclosures required under Sec. 226.20(c), the disclosures shall reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound when the disclosures are provided. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state law or other law. (Certain transactions are specifically addressed in this commentary. See, for example, the discussion of buydown transactions elsewhere in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c).)</p><p class="depth0">The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other grounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Modification of obligation. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in the note or contract that evidences the agreement. But this presumption is rebutted if another agreement between the parties legally modifies that note or contract. If the parties informally agree to a modification of the legal obligation, the modification should not be reflected in the disclosures unless it rises to the level of a change in the terms of the legal obligation. For example:</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor offers a preferential rate, such as an employee preferred rate, the disclosures should reflect the terms of the legal obligation. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.19(b) for an example of a preferred-rate transaction that is a variable-rate transaction.)</p><p class="depth0">If the contract provides for a certain monthly payment schedule but payments are made on a voluntary payroll deduction plan or an informal principal-reduction agreement, the disclosures should reflect the schedule in the contract.</p><p class="depth0">If the contract provides for regular monthly payments but the creditor informally permits the consumer to defer payments from time to time, for instance, to take account of holiday seasons or seasonal employment, the disclosures should reflect the regular monthly payments.</p><p class="depth0">3. Third-party buydowns. In certain transactions, a seller or other third party may pay an amount, either to the creditor or to the consumer, in order to reduce the consumer's payments or buy down the interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term. For example, a consumer and a bank agree to a mortgage with an interest rate of 15% and level payments over 25 years. By a separate agreement, the seller of the property agrees to subsidize the consumer's payments for the first 2 years of the mortgage, giving the consumer an effective rate of 12% for that period.</p><p class="depth0">If the lower rate is reflected in the credit contract between the consumer and the bank, the disclosures must take the buydown into account. For example, the annual percentage rate must be a composite rate that takes account of both the lower initial rate and the higher subsequent rate, and the payment schedule disclosures must reflect the 2 payment levels. However, the amount paid by the seller would not be specifically reflected in the disclosures given by the bank, since that amount constitutes seller's points and thus is not part of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">If the lower rate is not reflected in the credit contract between the consumer and the bank and the consumer is legally bound to the 15% rate from the outset, the disclosures given by the bank must not reflect the seller buydown in any way. For example, the annual percentage rate and payment schedule would not take into account the reduction in the interest rate and payment level for the first 2 years resulting from the buydown.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumer buydowns. In certain transactions, the consumer may pay an amount to the creditor to reduce the payments or obtain a lower interest rate on the transaction. Consumer buydowns must be reflected in the disclosures given for that transaction. To illustrate, in a mortgage transaction, the creditor and consumer agree to a note specifying a 14 percent interest rate. However, in a separate document, the consumer agrees to pay an amount to the creditor at consummation in return for a reduction in the interest rate to 12 percent for a portion of the mortgage term. The amount paid by the consumer may be deposited in an escrow account or may be retained by the creditor. Depending upon the buydown plan, the consumer's prepayment of the obligation may or may not result in a portion of the amount being credited or refunded to the consumer. In the disclosures given for the mortgage, the creditor must reflect the terms of the buydown agreement. For example:</p><p class="depth0">The amount paid by the consumer is a prepaid finance charge (even if deposited in an escrow account).</p><p class="depth0">A composite annual percentage rate must be calculated, taking into account both interest rates, as well as the effect of the prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">The payment schedule must reflect the multiple payment levels resulting from the buydown.</p><p class="depth0">The rules regarding consumer buydowns do not apply to transactions known as ``lender buydowns,'' In lender buydowns. a creditor pays an amount (either into an account or to the party to whom the obligation is sold) to reduce the consumer's payments or interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term. Typically, these transactions are structured as a buydown of the interest rate during an initial period of the transaction with a higher than usual rate for the remainder of the term. The disclosures for lender buydowns

should be based on the terms of the legal obligation between the consumer and the creditor. (See comment 17(c)(1)-3 for the analogous rules concerning third-party buydowns.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Split buydowns. In certain transactions, a third party (such as a seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to the creditor to reduce the interest rate. The creditor must include the portion paid by the consumer in the finance charge and disclose the corresponding multiple payment levels and composite annual percentage rate. The portion paid by the third party and the corresponding reduction in interest rate, however, should not be reflected in the disclosures unless the lower rate is reflected in the credit contract. (See the discussion on third-party and consumer buydown transactions elsewhere in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c).)</p><p class="depth0">6. Wrap-around financing. Wrap-around transactions, usually loans, involve the creditor's wrapping the outstanding balance on an existing loan and advancing additional funds to the consumer. The pre-existing loan, which is wrapped, may be to the same consumer or to a different consumer. In either case, the consumer makes a single payment to the new creditor, who makes the payments on the pre-existing loan to the original creditor. Wrap-around loans or sales are considered new single-advance transactions, with an amount financed equalling the sum of the new funds advanced by the wrap creditor and the remaining principal owed to the original creditor on the pre-existing loan. In disclosing the itemization of the amount financed, the creditor may use a label such as ``the amount that will be paid to creditor X'' to describe the remaining principal balance on the pre-existing loan. This approach to Truth in Lending calculations has no effect on calculations required by other statutes, such as state usury laws.</p><p class="depth0">7. Wrap-around financing with balloon payments. For wrap-around transactions involving a large final payment of the new funds before the maturity of the pre-existing loan, the amount financed is the sum of the new funds and the remaining principal on the pre-existing loan. The disclosures should be based on the shorter term of the wrap loan, with a large final payment of both the new funds and the total remaining principal on the pre-existing loan (although only the wrap loan will actually be paid off at that time).</p><p class="depth0">8. Basis of disclosures in variable-rate transactions. The disclosures for a variable-rate transaction must be given for the full term of the transaction and must be based on the terms in effect at the time of consummation. Creditors should base the disclosures only on the initial rate and should not assume that this rate will increase. For example, in a loan with an initial rate of 10 percent and a 5 percentage points rate cap, creditors should base the disclosures on the initial rate and should not assume that this rate will increase 5 percentage points. However, in a variable-rate transaction with a seller buydown that is reflected in the credit contract, a consumer buydown, or a discounted or premium rate, disclosures should not be based solely on the initial terms. In those transactions, the disclosed annual percentage rate should be a composite rate based on the rate in effect during the initial period and the rate that is the basis of the variable-rate feature for the remainder of the term. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c) for a discussion of buydown, discounted, and premium transactions and the commentary to Sec. 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of the redisclosure in certain mortgage transactions with a variable-rate feature.)</p><p class="depth0">9. Use of estimates in variable-rate transactions. The variable-rate feature does not, by itself, make the disclosures estimates.</p><p class="depth0">10. Discounted and premium variable-rate transactions. In some variable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. In a discounted transaction, for example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent margin. If the Treasury bill rate at consummation is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 percent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent.</p><p class="depth0">i. When creditors use an initial interest rate that is not calculated using the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate based on the initial rate for as long as it is charged and, for the remainder of the term, the rate that would have been applied using the index or formula at the time of consummation. The rate at consummation need not be used if a contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 day period before consummation in calculating a composite annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The effect of the multiple rates must also be reflected in the calculation and disclosure of the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If a loan contains a rate or payment cap that would prevent the initial rate or payment, at the time of the first adjustment, from changing to the rate determined by the

index or formula at consummation, the effect of that rate or payment cap should be reflected in the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Because these transactions involve irregular payment amounts, an annual percentage rate tolerance of \1/4\ of 1 percent applies, in accordance with Sec. 226.22(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">v. Examples of discounted variable-rate transactions include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A 30-year loan for $100,000 with no prepaid finance charges and rates determined by the Treasury bill rate plus 2 percent. Rate and payment adjustments are made annually. Although the Treasury bill rate at the time of consummation is 10 percent, the creditor sets the interest rate for one year at 9 percent, instead of 12 percent according to the formula. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate of 11.63 percent based on 9 percent for one year and 12 percent for 29 years. Reflecting those two rate levels, the payment schedule should show 12 payments of $804.62 and 348 payments of $1,025.31. The finance charge should be $266,463.32 and the total of payments $366,463.32.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same loan as above, except with a 2 percent rate cap on periodic adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate of 11.53 percent based on 9 percent for the first year, 11 percent for the second year, and 12 percent for the remaining 28 years. Reflecting those three rate levels, the payment schedule should show 12 payments of $804.62, 12 payments of $950.09, and 336 payments of $1,024.34. The finance charge should be $265,234.76 and the total of payments $365,234.76.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same loan as above, except with a 7\1/2\ percent cap on payment adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate of 11.64 percent, based on 9 percent for one year and 12 percent for 29 years. Because of the payment cap, five levels of payments should be reflected. The payment schedule should show 12 payments of $804.62, 12 payments of $864.97, 12 payments of $929.84, 12 payments of $999.58, and 312 payments of $1,070.04. The finance charge should be $277,040.60, and the total of payments $377,040.60.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A loan in which the initial interest rate is set according to the index or formula used for later adjustments but is not set at the value of the index or formula at consummation is not a discounted variable-rate loan. For example, if a creditor commits to an initial rate based on the formula on a date prior to consummation, but the index has moved during the period between that time and consummation, a creditor should base its disclosures on the initial rate.</p><p class="depth0">11. Examples of variable-rate transactions. Variable-rate transactions include:</p><p class="depth0">Renewable balloon-payment instruments where the creditor is both unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest rate at the time of renewal. Disclosures must be based on the payment amortization (unless the specified term of the obligation with renewals is shorter) and on the rate in effect at the time of consummation of the transaction. (Examples of conditions within a consumer's control include requirements that a consumer be current in payments or continue to reside in the mortgaged property. In contrast, setting a limit on the rate at which the creditor would be obligated to renew or reserving the right to change the credit standards at the time of renewal are examples of conditions outside a consumer's control.) If, however, a creditor is not obligated to renew as described above, disclosures must be based on the term of the balloon-payment loan. Disclosures also must be based on the term of the balloon-payment loan in balloon-payment instruments in which the legal obligation provides that the loan will be renewed by a ``refinancing'' of the obligation, as that term is defined by Sec. 226.20(a). If it cannot be determined from the legal obligation that the loan will be renewed by a ``refinancing,'' disclosures must be based either on the term of the balloon-payment loan or on the payment amortization, depending on whether the creditor is unconditionally obligated to renew the loan as described above. (This discussion does not apply to construction loans subject to Sec. 226.17(c)(6).)</p><p class="depth0">``Shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest and an appreciation share based on the consumer's equity in the mortgaged property. The appreciation share is payable in a lump sum at a specified time. Disclosures must be based on the fixed interest rate. (As discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.2, other types of shared-equity arrangements are not considered ``credit'' and are not subject to Regulation Z.)</p><p class="depth0">Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, and the note reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures are to be based on the preferred rate.</p><p class="depth0">Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a variable-rate feature are not considered variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">``Price level adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation. Disclosures are to be based on the fixed interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">12. Graduated payment adjustable rate mortgages. These mortgages involve both a variable interest rate and scheduled variations in payment amounts during the loan term. For example, under these plans, a series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments affect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain constant for a set period before rate adjustments affect the payment amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to cover the scheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the outset of the transaction. In these transactions, the disclosures should treat these features as follows:</p><p class="depth0">The finance charge includes the amount of negative amortization based on the assumption that the rate in effect at consummation remains unchanged.</p><p class="depth0">The amount financed does not include the amount of negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">As in any variable-rate transaction, the annual percentage rate is based on the terms in effect at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">The schedule of payments discloses the amount of any scheduled initial payments followed by an adjusted level of payments based on the initial interest rate. Since some mortgage plans contain limits on the amount of the payment adjustment, the payment schedule may require several different levels of payments, even with the assumption that the original interest rate does not increase.</p><p class="depth0">13. Growth-equity mortgages. Also referred to as payment-escalated mortgages, these mortgage plans involve scheduled payment increases to prematurely amortize the loan. The initial payment amount is determined as for a long-term loan with a fixed interest rate. Payment increases are scheduled periodically, based on changes in an index. The larger payments result in accelerated amortization of the loan. In disclosing these mortgage plans, creditors may either:</p><p class="depth0">Estimate the amount of payment increases, based on the best information reasonably available; or</p><p class="depth0">Disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in 226.18(f)(1).
(This discussion does not apply to growth-equity mortgages in which the amount of payment increases can be accurately determined at the time of disclosure. For these mortgages, as for graduated-payment mortgages, disclosures should reflect the scheduled increases in payments.)</p><p class="depth0">14. Reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, typically involve the disbursement of monthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment of the loan (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be required to be made at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the death of the consumer. In disclosing these transactions, creditors must apply the following rules, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0">If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for disbursements but repayment is due only upon the occurrence of a future event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements will be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval between disbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment may occur before or after the disbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume that you will repay the loan at the time our payments to you end. As provided in your agreement, your repayment may be required at a different time.''</p><p class="depth0">If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for disbursements nor a specified repayment date and these terms will be determined solely by reference to future events including the consumer's death, the creditor may assume that the disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using actuarial tables, for example) and that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period following the date of the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first. (If terms will be determined by reference to future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base the disclosures upon the occurance of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)</p><p class="depth0">In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the consumer. For example, if the note has a nonrecourse provision providing that the consumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be disbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you may be required to pay is limited by your agreement.''</p><p class="depth0">Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property will be shared between the consumer and the creditor. Such loans are

considered variable-rate mortgages, as described in comment 17(c)(1)-11, and the appreciation feature must be disclosed in accordance with Sec. 226.18(f)(1). If the reverse mortgage has a variable interest rate, is written for a term greater than one year, and is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, the shared appreciation feature must be described under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">15. Morris Plan transactions. When a deposit account is created for the sole purpose of accumulating payments and then is applied to satisfy entirely the consumer's obligation in the transaction, each deposit made into the account is considered the same as a payment on a loan for purposes of making disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">16. Number of transactions. Creditors have flexibility in handling credit extensions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For example:</p><p class="depth0">When a creditor finances the credit sale of a radio and a television on the same day, the creditor may disclose the sales as either 1 or 2 credit sale transactions.</p><p class="depth0">When a creditor finances a loan along with a credit sale of health insurance, the creditor may disclose in one of several ways: a single credit sale transaction, a single loan transaction, or a loan and a credit sale transaction.</p><p class="depth0">The separate financing of a downpayment in a credit sale transaction may, but need not, be disclosed as 2 transactions (a credit sale and a separate transaction for the financing of the downpayment).</p><p class="depth0">17. Special rules for tax refund anticipation loans. Tax refund loans, also known as refund anticipation loans (RALs), are transactions in which a creditor will lend up to the amount of a consumer's expected tax refund. RAL agreements typically require repayment upon demand, but also may provide that repayment is required when the refund is made. The agreements also typically provide that if the amount of the refund is less than the payment due, the consumer must pay the difference. Repayment often is made by a preauthorized offset to a consumer's account held with the creditor when the refund has been deposited by electronic transfer. Creditors may charge fees for RALs in addition to fees for filing the consumer's tax return electronically. In RAL transactions subject to the regulation the following special rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">If, under the terms of the legal obligation, repayment of the loan is required when the refund is received by the consumer (such as by deposit into the consumer's account), the disclosures should be based on the creditor's estimate of the time the refund will be delivered even if the loan also contains a demand clause. The practice of a creditor to demand repayment upon delivery of refunds does not determine whether the legal obligation requires that repayment be made at that time; this determination must be made according to applicable state or other law. (See comment 17(c)(5)-1 for the rules regarding disclosures if the loan is payable solely on demand or is payable either on demand or on an alternate maturity date.)</p><p class="depth0">If the consumer is required to repay more than the amount borrowed, the difference is a finance charge unless excluded under Sec. 226.4. In addition, to the extent that any fees charged in connection with the loan (such as for filing the tax return electronically) exceed those fees for a comparable cash transaction (that is, filing the tax return electronically without a loan), the difference must be included in the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">18. Pawn Transactions. When, in connection with an extension of credit, a consumer pledges or sells an item to a pawnbroker creditor in return for a sum of money and retains the right to redeem the item for a greater sum (the redemption price) within a specified period of time, disclosures are required. In addition to other disclosure requirements that may be applicable under Sec. 226.18, for purposes of pawn transactions:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount financed is the initial sum paid to the consumer. The pawnbroker creditor need not provide a separate itemization of the amount financed if that entire amount is paid directly to the consumer and the disclosed description of the amount financed is ``the amount of cash given directly to you'' or a similar phrase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The finance charge is the difference between the initial sum paid to the consumer and the redemption price plus any other finance charges paid in connection with the transaction. (See Sec. 226.4.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. The term of the transaction, for calculating the annual percentage rate, is the period of time agreed to by the pawnbroker creditor and the consumer. The term of the transaction does not include a grace period (including any statutory grace period) after the agreed redemption date.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis for estimates. Disclosures may be estimated when the exact information is unknown at the time disclosures are made. Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are made. The ``reasonably available'' standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors for

taxes and escrow fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise information will be available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures may be required under Sec. 226.17(f) or Sec. 226.19.</p><p class="depth0">2. Labelling estimates. Estimates must be designated as such in the segregated disclosures. Even though other disclosures are based on the same assumption on which a specific estimated disclosure was based, the creditor has some flexibility in labelling the estimates. Generally, only the particular disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is labelled as an estimate. However, when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the creditor has the option of labelling either every affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected. For example, when the finance charge is unknown because the date of consummation is unknown, the creditor must label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label as estimates the total of payments and the payment schedule. When many disclosures are estimates, the creditor may use a general statement, such as ``all numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure are estimates,'' as a method to label those disclosures as estimates.</p><p class="depth0">3. Simple-interest transactions. If consumers do not make timely payments in a simple-interest transaction, some of the amounts calculated for Truth in Lending disclosures will differ from amounts that consumers will actually pay over the term of the transaction. Creditors may label disclosures as estimates in these transactions. For example, because the finance charge and total of payments may be larger than disclosed if consumers make late payments, creditors may label the finance charge and total of payments as estimates. On the other hand, creditors may choose not to label disclosures as estimates and may base all disclosures on the assumption that payments will be made on time, disregarding any possible inaccuracies resulting from consumers' payment patterns.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Per-diem interest. This paragraph applies to any numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual percentage rate, or payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest charge that will be collected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the disclosures are not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of per-diem interest used to prepare disclosures is less than the amount of per-diem interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance charge is understated by $200, the disclosed finance charge is considered accurate even though the understatement is not within the $100 tolerance of Sec. 226.18(d)(1), and the finance charge was not labeled as an estimate. In this example, if in addition to the understatement related to the per-diem interest, a $90 fee is incorrectly omitted from the finance charge, causing it to be understated by a total of $290, the finance charge is considered accurate because the $90 fee is within the tolerance in Sec. 226.18(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minor variations. Section 226.17(c)(3) allows creditors to disregard certain factors in calculating and making disclosures. For example:</p><p class="depth0">Creditors may ignore the effects of collecting payments in whole cents. Because payments cannot be collected in fractional cents, it is often difficult to amortize exactly an obligation with equal payments; the amount of the last payment may require adjustment to account for the rounding of the other payments to whole cents.</p><p class="depth0">Creditors may base their disclosures on calculation tools that assume that all months have an equal number of days, even if their practice is to take account of the variations in months for purposes of collecting interest. For example, a creditor may use a calculation tool based on a 360-day year, when it in fact collects interest by applying a factor of \1/365\ of the annual rate to 365 days. This rule does not, however, authorize creditors to ignore, for disclosure purposes, the effects of applying \1/360\ of an annual rate to 365 days.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in Sec. 226.17(c)(3) for purposes of calculating and making all disclosures for a transaction or may, at its option, use the special rules for some disclosures and not others.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment schedule irregularities. When one or more payments in a transaction differ from the others because of a long or short first period, the variations may be ignored in disclosing the payment schedule, finance charge, annual percentage rate, and other terms. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A 36-month auto loan might be consummated on June 8 with payments due on July 1 and the first of each succeeding month. The creditor may base its calculations on a payment schedule that assumes 36 equal intervals and 36 equal installment payments, even though a precise computation would produce slightly different amounts because of the shorter first period.</p><p class="depth0">By contrast, in the same example, if the first payment were not scheduled until August 1, the irregular first period would exceed the limits in Sec. 226.17(c)(4); the creditor

could not use the special rule and could not ignore the extra days in the first period in calculating its disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Measuring odd periods. In determining whether a transaction may take advantage of the rule in Sec. 226.17(c)(4), the creditor must measure the variation against a regular period. For purposes of that rule:</p><p class="depth0">The first period is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the first payment.</p><p class="depth0">The term is the period from the date on which the finance charge begins to be earned to the date of the final payment.</p><p class="depth0">The regular period is the most common interval between payments in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">In transactions involving regular periods that are monthly, semimonthly or multiples of a month, the length of the irregular and regular periods may be calculated on the basis of either the actual number of days or an assumed 30-day month. In other transactions, the length of the periods is based on the actual number of days.</p><p class="depth0">3. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in Sec. 226.17(c)(4) for purposes of calculating and making some disclosures but may elect not to do so for all of the disclosures. For example, the variations may be ignored in calculating and disclosing the annual percentage rate but taken into account in calculating and disclosing the finance charge and payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">4. Relation to prepaid finance charges. Prepaid finance charges, including ``odd-days'' or ``per-diem'' interest, paid prior to or at closing may not be treated as the first payment on a loan. Thus, creditors may not disregard an irregularity in disclosing such finance charges.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand disclosures. Disclosures for demand obligations are based on an assumed 1-year term, unless an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation. Whether an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation is determined by applicable law. An alternate maturity date is not inferred from an informal principal reduction agreement or a similar understanding between the parties. However, when the note itself specifies a principal reduction schedule (for example, ``payable on demand or $2,000 plus interest quarterly''), an alternate maturity is stated and the disclosures must reflect that date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Future event as maturity date. An obligation whose maturity date is determined solely by a future event, as for example, a loan payable only on the sale of property, is not a demand obligation. Because no demand feature is contained in the obligation, demand disclosures under Sec. 226.18(i) are inapplicable. The disclosures should be based on the creditor's estimate of the time at which the specified event will occur, and may indicate the basis for the creditor's estimate, as noted in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a).</p><p class="depth0">3. Demand after stated period. Most demand transactions contain a demand feature that may be exercised at any point during the term, but certain transactions convert to demand status only after a fixed period. For example, in States prohibiting due-on-sale clauses, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) requires mortgages that it purchases to include a call option rider that may be exercised after 7 years. These mortgages are generally written as long-term obligations, but contain a demand feature that may be exercised only within a 30-day period at 7 years. The disclosures for these transactions should be based upon the legally agreed-upon maturity date. Thus, if a mortgage containing the 7-year FNMA call option is written as a 20-year obligation, the disclosures should be based on the 20-year term, with the demand feature disclosed under Sec. 226.18(i).</p><p class="depth0">4. Balloon mortgages. Balloon payment mortgages, with payments based on a long-term amortization schedule and a large final payment due after a shorter term, are not demand obligations unless a demand feature is specifically contained in the contract. For example, a mortgage with a term of 5 years and a payment schedule based on 20 years would not be treated as a mortgage with a demand feature, in the absence of any contractual demand provisions. In this type of mortgage, disclosures should be based on the 5-year term.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0">1. Series of advances. Section 226.17(c)(6)(i) deals with a series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount. A creditor may treat all of the advances as a single transaction or disclose each advance as a separate transaction. If these advances are treated as 1 transaction and the timing and amounts of advances are unknown, creditors must make disclosures based on estimates, as provided in Sec. 226.17(c)(2). If the advances are disclosed separately, disclosures must be provided before each advance occurs, with the disclosures for the first advance provided by consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Construction loans. Section 226.17(c)(6)(ii) provides a flexible rule for disclosure of construction loans that may be permanently financed. These transactions have 2 distinct phases, similar to 2 separate transactions. The construction loan may be for initial construction or subsequent construction, such as rehabilitation or remodelling. The construction period usually involves several disbursements of funds at times and in amounts that are unknown at the beginning of that period, with the consumer paying only accrued interest until construction is completed. Unless the obligation is paid at that

time, the loan then converts to permanent financing in which the loan amount is amortized just as in a standard mortgage transaction. Section 226.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for the 2 phases. This rule is available whether the consumer is initially obligated to accept construction financing only or is obligated to accept both construction and permanent financing from the outset. If the consumer is obligated on both phases and the creditor chooses to give 2 sets of disclosures, both sets must be given to the consumer initially, because both transactions would be consummated at that time. (appendix D provides a method of calculating the annual percentage rate and other disclosures for construction loans, which may be used, at the creditor's option, in disclosing construction financing.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple-advance construction loans. Section 226.17(c)(6)(i) and (ii) are not mutually exclusive. For example, in a transaction that finances the construction of a dwelling that may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase may consist of a series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount. In these cases, the creditor may disclose the construction phase as either 1 or more than 1 transaction and also disclose the permanent financing as a separate transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Residential mortgage transaction. See the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(24) for a discussion of the effect of Sec. 226.17(c)(6) on the definition of a residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">5. Allocation of points. When a creditor utilizes the special rule in Sec. 226.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple transactions, buyers points or similar amounts imposed on the consumer must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. While such amounts should not be taken into account more than once in making calculations, they may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, if a construction-permanent loan is subject to 5 points imposed on the consumer and the creditor chooses to disclose the 2 phases separately, the 5 points may be allocated entirely to the construction loan, entirely to the permanent loan, or divided in any manner between the two. However, the entire 5 points may not be applied twice, that is, to both the construction and the permanent phases.</p><p class="depth0">17(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple creditors. If a credit transaction involves more than one creditor:</p><p class="depth0">The creditors must choose which of them will make the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather than partial disclosures from several creditors.</p><p class="depth0">All disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure. For example, if one of the creditors is the seller, the total sale price disclosure under Sec. 226.18(j) must be made, even though the disclosing creditor is not the seller.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. When two consumers are joint obligors with primary liability on an obligation, the disclosures may be given to either one of them. If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, the disclosures must be given to the principal debtor. In rescindable transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each consumer who has the right to rescind under Sec. 226.23, although the disclosures required under Sec. 226.19(b) need only be provided to the consumer who expresses an interest in a variable-rate loan program.</p><p class="depth0">17(e) Effect of subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0">1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events occurring after the disclosures are made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be required to make new disclosures under Sec. 226.17(f) or Sec. 226.19 if the events occurred between disclosure and consummation or under Sec. 226.20 if the events occurred after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">17(f) Early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in rate or other terms. Redisclosure is required for changes that occur between the time disclosures are made and consummation if the annual percentage rate in the consummated transaction exceeds the limits prescribed in this section, even if the initial disclosures would be considered accurate under the tolerances in Sec. 226.18(d) or 226.22(a). To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. General. A. If disclosures are made in a regular transaction on July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the actual annual percentage rate varies by more than \1/8\ of 1 percentage point from the disclosed annual percentage rate, the creditor must either redisclose the changed terms or furnish a complete set of new disclosures before consummation. Redisclosure is required even if the disclosures made on July 1 are based on estimates and marked as such.</p><p class="depth0">B. In a regular transaction, if early disclosures are marked as estimates and the disclosed annual percentage rate is within \1/8\ of 1 percentage point of the rate at consummation, the creditor need not redisclose the changed terms (including the annual percentage rate).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nonmortgage loan. If disclosures are made on July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the finance charge increased by $35 but the disclosed annual percentage rate is within the permitted tolerance, the creditor must at least redisclose the changed terms that were not marked as estimates. (See Sec. 226.18(d)(2) of this part.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mortgage loan. At the time TILA disclosures are prepared in July, the loan closing is scheduled for July 31 and the creditor does not plan to collect per-diem interest at consummation. Consummation actually occurs on August 5, and per-diem interest for the remainder of August is collected as a prepaid finance charge. Assuming there were no other changes requiring redisclosure, the creditor may rely on the disclosures prepared in July that were accurate when they were prepared. However, if the creditor prepares new disclosures in August that will be provided at consummation, the new disclosures must take into account the amount of the per-diem interest known to the creditor at that time.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable rate. The addition of a variable rate feature to the credit terms, after early disclosures are given, requires new disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content of new disclosures. If redisclosure is required, the creditor has the option of either providing a complete set of new disclosures, or providing disclosures of only the terms that vary from those originally disclosed. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.19(a)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Special rules. In mortgage transactions subject to Sec. 226.19, the creditor must redisclose if, between the delivery of the required early disclosures and consummation, the annual percentage rate changes by more than a stated tolerance. When subsequent events occur after consummation, new disclosures are required only if there is a refinancing or an assumption within the meaning of Sec. 226.20.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Irregular transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, a transaction is deemed to be ``irregular'' according to the definition in footnote 46 of Sec. 226.22(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">17(g) Mail or telephone orders--delay in disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions for use. When the creditor receives a mail or telephone request for credit, the creditor may delay making the disclosures until the first payment is due if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0">The credit request is initiated without face-to-face or direct telephone solicitation. (Creditors may, however, use the special rule when credit requests are solicited by mail.)</p><p class="depth0">The creditor has supplied the specified credit information about its credit terms either to the individual consumer or to the public generally. That information may be distributed through advertisements, catalogs, brochures, special mailers, or similar means.</p><p class="depth0">2. Insurance. The location requirements for the insurance disclosures under Sec. 226.18(n) permit them to appear apart from the other disclosures. Therefore, a creditor may mail an insurance authorization to the consumer and then prepare the other disclosures to reflect whether or not the authorization is completed by the consumer. Creditors may also disclose the insurance cost on a unit-cost basis, if the transaction meets the requirements of Sec. 226.17(g).</p><p class="depth0">17(h) Series of sales--delay in disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The creditor may delay the disclosures for individual credit sales in a series of such sales until the first payment is due on the current sale, assuming the 2 conditions in this paragraph are met. If those conditions are not met, the general timing rules in Sec. 266.17(b) apply.</p><p class="depth0">2. Basis of disclosures. Creditors structuring disclosures for a series of sales under Sec. 226.17(h) may compute the total sale price as either:</p><p class="depth0">The cash price for the sale plus that portion of the finance charge and other charges applicable to that sale; or</p><p class="depth0">The cash price for the sale, other charges applicable to the sale, and the total finance charge and outstanding principal.</p><p class="depth0">17(i) Interim student credit extensions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Student credit plans involve extensions of credit for education purposes where the repayment amount and schedule are not known at the time credit is advanced. These plans include loans made under any student credit plan, whether government or private, where the repayment period does not begin immediately. (Certain student credit plans that meet this definition are exempt from Regulation Z. See Sec. 226.3(f).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Relation to other sections. For disclosures made before the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 226.46, 47, and 48, paragraph 17(i) permitted creditors to omit from the disclosures the terms set forth in that paragraph at the time the credit was actually extended. However, creditors were required to make complete disclosures at the time the creditor and consumer agreed upon the repayment schedule for the total obligation. At that time, a new set of disclosures of all applicable items under Sec. 226.18 was required. Most student credit plans are subject to the requirements in Sec. Sec. 226.46, 47, and 48. Consequently, for applications for student credit plans received on or after the mandatory compliance date of Sec. Sec. 226.46, 47, and 48, the creditor may not omit from the disclosures the terms set forth in paragraph 17(i). Instead, the creditor must comply with Sec. Sec. 226.46, 47, and 48, if applicable, or with Sec. Sec. 226.17 and 226.18.</p><p class="depth0">3. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures given at the time of execution of the interim note should reflect two annual percentage rates, one for the interim period and one for the repayment period. The use of Sec. 226.17(i) in making disclosures does not, by itself, make those disclosures estimates. Any portion of the finance charge, such as statutory interest, that is attributable to the interim period and is paid by the student (either as a prepaid finance charge, periodically during the interim period, in one payment at the end of the interim period, or capitalized at the beginning of the repayment period) must be reflected in the interim annual percentage rate. Interest subsidies, such as payments made by either a state or the Federal government on an interim loan, must be excluded in computing the annual percentage rate on the interim obligation, when the consumer has no contingent liability for payment of those amounts. Any finance charges that are paid separately by the student at the outset or withheld from the proceeds of the loan are prepaid finance charges. An example of this type of charge is the loan guarantee fee. The sum of the prepaid finance charges is deducted from the loan proceeds to determine the amount financed and included in the calculation of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consolidation. Consolidation of the interim student credit extensions through a renewal note with a set repayment schedule is treated as a new transaction with disclosures made as they would be for a refinancing. Any unearned portion of the finance charge must be reflected in the new finance charge and annual percentage rate, and is not added to the new amount financed. In itemizing the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c), the creditor may combine the principal balances remaining on the interim extensions at the time of consolidation and categorize them as the amount paid on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">5. Approved student credit forms. See the commentary to appendix H regarding disclosure forms approved for use in certain student credit programs for which applications were received prior to the mandatory compliance date of Sec. Sec. 226.46, 47, and 48.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 121, 122, 124, and 128, and the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071) as amended by Pub. L. 97-35, August 13, 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.2 and appendix H.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Sections 226.6 and 226.8.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: With few exceptions, the disclosures must now appear apart from all other information, and may not be interspersed with that information. The disclosures must be based on the legal obligation between the parties, rather than any side agreement.</p><p class="depth0">The assumed maturity period for demand loans has been increased from 6 months to 1 year. Any alternate maturity date must be stated in the legal obligation rather than inferred from the documents, in order to form a basis for disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">In multiple-advance transactions, a series of advances up to a certain amount and construction loans that may be permanently financed may be disclosed, at the creditor's option, as either a single transaction or several transactions. Appendix D is applicable only to multiple advances for the construction of a dwelling, whereas its predecessor, Interpretation Sec. 226.813, could be used for all multiple-advance transactions.</p><p class="depth0">If disclosures are made before the date of consummation, the creditor need not provide updated disclosures at consummation unless the annual percentage rate has changed beyond certain limits or a variable rate feature has been added.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.18--Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. As applicable. The disclosures required by this section need be made only as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated entirely. For example:</p><p class="depth0">In a loan transaction, the creditor may delete disclosure of the total sale price.</p><p class="depth0">In a credit sale requiring disclosure of the total sale price under Sec. 226.18(j), the creditor may delete any reference to a downpayment where no downpayment is involved.</p><p class="depth0">Where the amounts of several numerical disclosures are the same, the ``as applicable'' language also permits creditors to combine the terms, so long as it is done in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:</p><p class="depth0">In a transaction in which the amount financed equals the total of payments, the creditor may disclose ``amount financed/total of payments,'' together with descriptive language, followed by a single amount.</p><p class="depth0">However, if the terms are separated on the disclosure statement and separate space is provided for each amount, both disclosures must be completed, even though the same amount is entered in each space.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. See the commentary to Sec. 226.17 and appendix H for a discussion of the format to be used in making these disclosures, as well as acceptable modifications.</p><p class="depth0">18(a) Creditor.</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of creditor. The creditor making the disclosures must be identified. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option, appear apart from the other disclosures. Use of the creditor's name is sufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or telephone number. In transactions with multiple creditors, any one of them may make the disclosures; the one doing so must be identified.</p><p class="depth0">18(b) Amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The net amount of credit extended must be disclosed using the term amount financed and a descriptive explanation similar to the phrase in the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rebates and loan premiums. In a loan transaction, the creditor may offer a premium in the form of cash or merchandise to prospective borrowers. Similarly, in a credit sale transaction, a seller's or manufacturer's rebate may be offered to prospective purchasers of the creditor's goods or services. At the creditor's option, these amounts may be either reflected in the Truth in Lending disclosures or disregarded in the disclosures. If the creditor chooses to reflect them in the Sec. 226.18 disclosures, rather than disregard them, they may be taken into account in any manner as part of those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Downpayments. A downpayment is defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(18) to include, at the creditor's option, certain deferred downpayments or pick-up payments. A deferred downpayment that meets the criteria set forth in the definition may be treated as part of the downpayment, at the creditor's option.</p><p class="depth0">Deferred downpayments that are not treated as part of the downpayment (either because they do not meet the definition or because the creditor simply chooses not to treat them as downpayments) are included in the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">Deferred downpayments that are treated as part of the downpayment are not part of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Adding other amounts. Fees or other charges that are not part of the finance charge and that are financed rather than paid separately at consummation of the transaction are included in the amount financed. Typical examples are real estate settlement charges and premiums for voluntary credit life and disability insurance excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4. This paragraph does not include any amounts already accounted for under Sec. 226.18(b)(1), such as taxes, tag and title fees, or the costs of accessories or service policies that the creditor includes in the cash price.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepaid finance charges. Prepaid finance charges that are paid separately in cash or by check should be deducted under Sec. 226.18(b)(3) in calculating the amount financed. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">A consumer applies for a loan of $2,500 with a $40 loan fee. The face amount of the note is $2,500 and the consumer pays the loan fee separately by cash or check at closing. The principal loan amount for purposes of Sec. 226.18(b)(1) is $2,500 and $40 should be deducted under Sec. 226.18(b(3), thereby yielding an amount financed of $2,460.</p><p class="depth0">In some instances, as when loan fees are financed by the creditor, finance charges are incorporated in the face amount of the note. Creditors have the option, when the charges are not add-on or discount charges, of determining a principal loan amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) that either includes or does not include the amount of the finance charges. (Thus the principal loan amount may, but need not, be determined to equal the face amount of the note.) When the finance charges are included in the principal loan amount, they should be deducted as prepaid finance charges under Sec. 226.18(b)(3). When the finance charges are not included in the principal loan amount, they should not be deducted under Sec. 226.18(b)(3). The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.18(b) to this type of transaction. Each example assumes a loan request of $2,500 with a loan fee of $40; the creditor assesses the loan fee by increasing the face amount of the note to $2,540.</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) to be $2,540, it has included the loan fee in the principal loan amount and should deduct $40 as a prepaid finance charge under Sec. 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,500.</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) to be $2,500, it has not included the loan fee in the principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,500.The same rules apply when the creditor does not increase the face amount of the note by the amount of the charge but collects the charge by withholding it from the amount advanced to the consumer. To illustrate, the following examples assume a loan request of $2,500 with a loan fee of $40; the creditor prepares a note for $2,500 and advances $2,460 to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) to be $2,500, it has included the loan fee in the principal loan amount and should deduct $40 as a prepaid finance charge under Sec. 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,460.</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) to be $2,460, it has not included the loan fee in the principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under Sec. 226.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,460.Thus in the examples where the creditor derives the net amount of credit by determining a principal loan amount that does not include the amount of the finance charge, no subtraction is appropriate. Creditors should note, however, that although the charges are not subtracted as prepaid finance charges in those examples, they are nonetheless finance charges and must be treated as such.</p><p class="depth0">2. Add-on or discount charges. All finance charges must be deducted from the amount of credit in calculating the amount financed. If the principal loan amount reflects finance charges that meet the definition of a prepaid finance charge in Sec. 226.2, those charges are included in the Sec. 226.18(b)(1) amount and deducted under Sec. 226.18(b)(3). However, if the principal loan amount includes finance charges that do not meet the definition of a prepaid finance charge, the Sec. 226.18(b)(1) amount must exclude those finance charges. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.18(b) to these types of transactions. Each example assumes a loan request of $1000 for 1 year, subject to a 6 percent precomputed interest rate, with a $10 loan fee paid separately at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor assesses add-on interest of $60 which is added to the $1000 in loan proceeds for an obligation with a face amount of $1060. The principal for purposes of Sec. 226.18(b)(1) is $1000, no amounts are added under Sec. 226.18(b)(2), and the $10 loan fee is a prepaid finance charge to be deducted under Sec. 226.18(b)(3). The amount financed is $990.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor assesses discount interest of $60 and distributes $940 to the consumer, who is liable for an obligation with a face amount of $1000. The principal under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) is $940, which results in an amount financed of $930, after deduction of the $10 prepaid finance charge under Sec. 226.18(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">The creditor assesses $60 in discount interest by increasing the face amount of the obligation to $1060, with the consumer receiving $1000. The principal under Sec. 226.18(b)(1) is thus $1000 and the amount financed $990, after deducting the $10 prepaid finance charge under Sec. 226.18(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">18(c) Itemization of amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor has 2 alternatives in complying with Sec. 226.18(c):</p><p class="depth0">The creditor may inform the consumer, on the segregated disclosures, that a written itemization of the amount financed will be provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the customer in fact requests it.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course, without notifying the consumer of the right to receive it or waiting for a request.</p><p class="depth0">Whether given as a matter of course or only on request, the itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by Sec. 226.18, although separate from those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional information. Section 226.18(c) establishes only a minimum standard for the material to be included in the itemization of the amount financed. Creditors have considerable flexibility in revising or supplementing the information listed in Sec. 226.18(c) and shown in model form H-3, although no changes are required. The creditor may, for example, do one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Include amounts that reflect payments not part of the amount financed. For example, escrow items and certain insurance premiums may be included, as discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Organize the categories in any order. For example, the creditor may rearrange the terms in a mathematical progression that depicts the arithmetic relationship of the terms.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Add categories. For example, in a credit sale, the creditor may include the cash price and the downpayment. If the credit sale involves a trade-in of the consumer's car and an existing lien on that car exceeds the value of the trade-in amount, the creditor may disclose the consumer's trade-in value, the creditor's payoff of the existing lien, and the resulting additional amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Further itemize each category. For example, the amount paid directly to the consumer may be subdivided into the amount given by check and the amount credited to the consumer's savings account.</p><p class="depth0">v. Label categories with different language from that shown in Sec. 226.18(c). For example, an amount paid on the consumer's account may be revised to specifically identify the account as ``your auto loan with us.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Delete, leave blank, mark ``N/A'' or otherwise not inapplicable categories in the itemization. For example, in a credit sale with no prepaid finance charges or amounts paid to others, the amount financed may consist of only the cash price less downpayment. In this case, the itemization may be composed of only a single category and all other categories may be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">3. Amounts appropriate to more than one category. When an amount may appropriately be placed in any of several categories and the creditor does not wish to revise the categories shown in Sec. 226.18(c), the creditor has considerable flexibility in determining where to show the amount. For example:</p><p class="depth0">In a credit sale, the portion of the purchase price being financed by the creditor may be viewed as either an amount paid to the consumer or an amount paid on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. RESPA transactions. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires creditors to provide a good faith estimate of closing costs and a settlement statement listing the amounts paid by the consumer. Transactions subject to RESPA are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 226.18(c) if the creditor complies with RESPA's requirements for a good faith estimate and settlement statement. The itemization of the amount financed need not be given, even though the content and timing of the good faith estimate and settlement statement under RESPA differ from the requirements

of Sec. Sec. 226.18(c) and 226.19(a)(2). If a creditor chooses to substitute RESPA's settlement statement for the itemization when redisclosure is required under Sec. 226.19(a)(2), the statement must be delivered to the consumer at or prior to consummation. The disclosures required by Sec. Sec. 226.18(c) and 226.19(a)(2) may appear on the same page or on the same document as the good faith estimate or the settlement statement, so long as the requirements of Sec. 226.17(a) are met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts paid to consumer. This encompasses funds given to the consumer in the form of cash or a check, including joint proceeds checks, as well as funds placed in an asset account. It may include money in an interest-bearing account even if that amount is considered a required deposit under Sec. 226.18(r). For example, in a transaction with total loan proceeds of $500, the consumer receives a check for $300 and $200 is required by the creditor to be put into an interest-bearing account. Whether or not the $200 is a required deposit, it is part of the amount financed. At the creditor's option, it may be broken out and labeled in the itemization of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts credited to consumer's account. The term consumer's account refers to an account in the nature of a debt with that creditor. It may include, for example, an unpaid balance on a prior loan, a credit sale balance or other amounts owing to that creditor. It does not include asset accounts of the consumer such as savings or checking accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts paid to others. This includes, for example, tag and title fees; amounts paid to insurance companies for insurance premiums; security interest fees, and amounts paid to credit bureaus, appraisers or public officials. When several types of insurance premiums are financed, they may, at the creditor's option, be combined and listed in one sum, labeled ``insurance'' or similar term. This includes, but is not limited to, different types of insurance premiums paid to one company and different types of insurance premiums paid to different companies. Except for insurance companies and other categories noted in footnote 41, third parties must be identified by name.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges added to amounts paid to others. A sum is sometimes added to the amount of a fee charged to a consumer for a service provided by a third party (such as for an extended warranty or a service contract) that is payable in the same amount in comparable cash and credit transactions. In the credit transaction, the amount is retained by the creditor. Given the flexibility permitted in meeting the requirements of the amount financed itemization (see the commentary to Sec. 226.18(c)), the creditor in such cases may reflect that the creditor has retained a portion of the amount paid to others. For example, the creditor could add to the category ``amount paid to others'' language such as ``(we may be retaining a portion of this amount).''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepaid finance charge. Prepaid finance charges that are deducted under Sec. 226.18(b)(3) must be disclosed under this section. The prepaid finance charges must be shown as a total amount but may, at the creditor's option, also be further itemized and described. All amounts must be reflected in this total, even if portions of the prepaid finance charge are also reflected elsewhere. For example, if at consummation the creditor collects interim interest of $30 and a credit report fee of $10, a total prepaid finance charge of $40 must be shown. At the creditor's option, the credit report fee paid to a third party may also be shown elsewhere as an amount included in Sec. 226.18(c)(1)(iii). The creditor may also further describe the 2 components of the prepaid finance charge, although no itemization of this element is required by Sec. 226.18(c)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">2. Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums. RESPA requires creditors to give consumers a settlement statement disclosing the costs associated with mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement are mortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of prepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance listed on the line for mortgage insurance on the settlement statement (line 1002 on HUD-1 or HUD 1-A), without adjustment, even if the actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA's escrow accounting rules. Figures for mortgage insurance disclosed in conformance with RESPA shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">18(d) Finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the finance charge as a dollar amount, using the term finance charge, and must include a brief description similar to that in Sec. 226.18(d). The creditor may, but need not, further modify the descriptor for variable rate transactions with a phrase such as which is subject to change. The finance charge must be shown on the disclosures only as a total amount; the elements of the finance charge must not be itemized in the segregated disclosures, although the regulation does not prohibit their itemization elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">2. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">18(d)(2) Other credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Tolerance. When a finance charge error results in a misstatement of the amount financed, or some other dollar amount for which the regulation provides no specific tolerance, the misstated disclosure does not

violate the act or the regulation if the finance charge error is within the permissible tolerance under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">18(e) Annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the cost of the credit as an annual rate, using the term annual percentage rate, plus a brief descriptive phrase comparable to that used in Sec. 226.18(e). For variable rate transactions, the descriptor may be further modified with a phrase such as which is subject to change. Under Sec. 226.17(a), the terms annual percentage rate and finance charge must be more conspicuous than the other required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exception. Footnote 42 provides an exception for certain transactions in which no annual percentage rate disclosure is required.</p><p class="depth0">18(f) Variable rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The requirements of Sec. 226.18(f) apply to all transactions in which the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the rate originally disclosed to the consumer. It includes not only increases in the interest rate but also increases in other components, such as the rate of required credit life insurance. The provisions, however, do not apply to increases resulting from delinquency (including late payment), default, assumption, acceleration or transfer of the collateral. Section 226.18(f)(1) applies to variable-rate transactions that are not secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and to those that are secured by the principal dwelling but have a term of one year or less. Section 226.18(f)(2) applies to variable-rate transactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. Moreover, transactions subject to Sec. 226.18(f)(2) are subject to the special early disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.19(b). (However, ``shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.18(f)(1) and not to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.18(f)(2) and 226.19(b) regardless of the general coverage of those sections.) Creditors are permitted under footnote 43 to substitute in any variable-rate transaction the disclosures required under Sec. 226.19(b) for those disclosures ordinarily required under 226.18(f)(1). Creditors who provide variable-rate disclosures under Sec. 226.19(b) must comply with all of the requirements of that section, including the timing of disclosures, and must also provide the disclosures required under Sec. 226.18(f)(2). Creditors utilizing footnote 43 may, but need not, also provide disclosures pursuant to Sec. 226.20(c). (Substitution of disclosures under Sec. 226.18(f)(1) in transactions subject to Sec. 226.19(b) is not permitted under the footnote.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Terms used in disclosure. In describing the variable rate feature, the creditor need not use any prescribed terminology. For example, limitations and hypothetical examples may be described in terms of interest rates rather than annual percentage rates. The model forms in appendix H provide examples of ways in which the variable rate disclosures may be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Conversion feature. In variable-rate transactions with an option permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-rate transaction, the conversion option is a variable-rate feature that must be disclosed. In making disclosures under Sec. 226.18(f)(1), creditors should disclose the fact that the rate may increase upon conversion; identify the index or formula used to set the fixed rate; and state any limitations on and effects of an increase resulting from conversion that differ from other variable-rate features. Because Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iv) requires only one hypothetical example (such as an example of the effect on payments resulting from changes in the index), a second hypothetical example need not be given.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Circumstances. The circumstances under which the rate may increase include identification of any index to which the rate is tied, as well as any conditions or events on which the increase is contingent.</p><p class="depth0">When no specific index is used, any identifiable factors used to determine whether to increase the rate must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">When the increase in the rate is purely discretionary, the fact that any increase is within the creditor's discretion must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">When the index is internally defined (for example, by that creditor's prime rate), the creditor may comply with this requirement by either a brief description of that index or a statement that any increase is in the discretion of the creditor. An externally defined index, however, must be identified.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitations. This includes any maximum imposed on the amount of an increase in the rate at any time, as well as any maximum on the total increase over the life of the transaction. Except for private education loans disclosures, when there are no limitations, the creditor may, but need not, disclose that fact, and limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under State or Federal statutes or regulations. (See Sec. 226.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum interest rate be included in certain variable-rate transactions.) For disclosures with respect to private education loan disclosures, see comment 47(b)(1)-2.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Effects. Disclosure of the effect of an increase refers to an increase in the number or amount of payments or an increase in the final payment. In addition, the creditor may make a brief reference to negative amortization that may result from a rate increase.

(See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1) regarding directly related information.) If the effect cannot be determined, the creditor must provide a statement of the possible effects. For example, if the exercise of the variable-rate feature may result in either more or larger payments, both possibilities must be noted.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Hypothetical example. The example may, at the creditor's option appear apart from the other disclosures. The creditor may provide either a standard example that illustrates the terms and conditions of that type of credit offered by that creditor or an example that directly reflects the terms and conditions of the particular transaction. In transactions with more than one variable-rate feature, only one hypothetical example need be provided. (See the commentary to section 226.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of more than one hypothetical example as directly related information.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Hypothetical example not required. The creditor need not provide a hypothetical example in the following transactions with a variable-rate feature:</p><p class="depth0">Demand obligations with no alternate maturity date.</p><p class="depth0">Private education loans as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Multiple-advance construction loans disclosed pursuant to appendix D, Part I.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In variable-rate transactions that have a term greater than one year and are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must give special early disclosures under Sec. 226.19(b) in addition to the later disclosures required under Sec. 226.18(f)(2). The disclosures under Sec. 226.18(f)(2) must state that the transaction has a variable-rate feature and that variable-rate disclosures have been provided earlier. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of certain directly related information in addition to the variable-rate disclosures required under Sec. 226.18(f)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">18(g) Payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts included in repayment schedule. The repayment schedule should reflect all components of the finance charge, not merely the portion attributable to interest. A prepaid finance charge, however, should not be shown in the repayment schedule as a separate payment. The payments may include amounts beyond the amount financed and finance charge. For example, the disclosed payments may, at the creditor's option, reflect certain insurance premiums where the premiums are not part of either the amount financed or the finance charge, as well as real estate escrow amounts such as taxes added to the payment in mortage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred downpayments. As discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(18), deferred downpayments or pick-up payments that meet the conditions set forth in the definition of downpayment may be treated as part of the downpayment. Even if treated as a downpayment, that amount may nevertheless be disclosed as part of the payment schedule, at the creditor's option.</p><p class="depth0">3. Total number of payments. In disclosing the number of payments for transactions with more than one payment level, creditors may but need not disclose as a single figure the total number of payments for all levels. For example, in a transaction calling for 108 payments of $350, 240 payments of $335, and 12 payments of $330, the creditor need not state that there will be a total of 360 payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Timing of payments. i. General rule. Section 226.18(g) requires creditors to disclose the timing of payments. To meet this requirement, creditors may list all of the payment due dates. They also have the option of specifying the ``period of payments'' scheduled to repay the obligation. As a general rule, creditors that choose this option must disclose the payment intervals or frequency, such as ``monthly''or ``bi-weekly,'' and the calendar date that the beginning payment is due. For example, a creditor may disclose that payments are due ``monthly beginning on July 1, 1998.'' This information, when combined with the number of payments, is necessary to define the repayment period and enable a consumer to determine all of the payment due dates.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Exception. In a limited number of circumstances, the beginning-payment date is unknown and difficult to determine at the time disclosures are made. For example, a consumer may become obligated on a credit contract that contemplates the delayed disbursement of funds based on a contingent event, such as the completion of home repairs. Disclosures may also accompany loan checks that are sent by mail, in which case the initial disbursement and repayment dates are solely within the consumer's control. In such cases, if the beginning-payment date is unknown the creditor may use an estimated date and label the disclosure as an estimate pursuant to Sec. 226.17(c). Alternatively, the disclosure may refer to the occurrence of a particular event, for example, by disclosing that the beginning payment is due ``30 days after the first loan disbursement.'' This information also may be included with an estimated date to explain the basis for the creditor's estimate. See Comment 17(a)(1)-5(iii).</p><p class="depth0">5. Mortgage insurance. The payment schedule should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance payments until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment schedule must reflect the legal obligation, as determined by applicable state

or other law. For example, assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the creditor collects at closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is terminated, the payment schedule should reflect 130 premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, the payment schedule should reflect 128 monthly premium payments. (For assumptions in calculating a payment schedule that includes mortgage insurance that must be automatically terminated, see comments 17(c)(1)-8 and 17(c)(1)-10.)</p><p class="depth0">6. Mortgage transactions. Section 226.18(g) applies only to closed-end transactions other than transactions that are subject to Sec. 226.18(s). Section 226.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with Sec. 226.18(s) and does not observe the requirements of Sec. 226.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with Sec. 226.18(g) and does not observe the requirements of Sec. 226.18(s).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor has the option of disclosing only the due dates or periods of scheduled interest payments in the first year (for example, ``interest payable quarterly'' or ``interest due the first of each month''). The amounts of the interest payments need not be shown.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Abbreviated disclosure. The creditor may disclose an abbreviated payment schedule when the amount of each regularly scheduled payment (other than the first or last payment) includes an equal amount to be applied on principal and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to the decreasing unpaid balance. This option is also available when mortgage-guarantee insurance premiums, paid either monthly or annually, cause variations in the amount of the scheduled payments, reflecting the continual decrease or increase in the premium due. In addition, in transactions where payments vary because interest and principal are paid at different intervals, the two series of payments may be disclosed separately and the abbreviated payment schedule may be used for the interest payments. For example, in transactions with fixed quarterly principal payments and monthly interest payments based on the outstanding principal balance, the amount of the interest payments will change quarterly as principal declines. In such cases the creditor may treat the interest and principal payments as two separate series of payments, separately disclosing the number, amount, and due dates of principal payments, and, using the abbreviated payment schedule, the number, amount, and due dates of interest payments. This option may be used when interest and principal are scheduled to be paid on the same date of the month as well as on different dates of the month. The creditor using this alternative must disclose the dollar amount of the highest and lowest payments and make reference to the variation in payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Combined payment schedule disclosures. Creditors may combine the option in this paragraph with the general payment schedule requirements in transactions where only a portion of the payment schedule meets the conditions of Sec. 226.18(g)(2). For example, in a graduated payment mortgage where payments rise sharply for 5 years and then decline over the next 25 years because of decreasing mortgage insurance premiums, the first 5 years would be disclosed under the general rule in Sec. 226.18(g) and the next 25 years according to the abbreviated schedule in Sec. 226.18(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect on other disclosures. Section 226.18(g)(2) applies only to the payment schedule disclosure. The actual amounts of payments must be taken into account in calculating and disclosing the finance charge and the annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(h) Total of payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The total of payments must be disclosed using that term, along with a descriptive phrase similar to the one in the regulation. The descriptive explanation may be revised to reflect a variable rate feature with a brief phrase such as ``based on the current annual percentage rate which may change.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of total of payments. The total of payments is the sum of the payments disclosed under Sec. 226.18(g). For example, if the creditor disclosed a deferred portion of the downpayment as part of the payment schedule, that payment must be reflected in the total disclosed under this paragraph. To calculate the total of payments amount for transactions subject to Sec. 226.18(s), creditors should use the rules in Sec. 226.18(g) and associated commentary and, for adjustable-rate transactions, comments 17(c)(1)-8 and -10.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exception. Footnote 44 permits creditors to omit disclosure of the total of payments in single-payment transactions. This exception does not apply to a transaction calling for a single payment of principal combined with periodic payments of interest.</p><p class="depth0">4. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor may omit disclosure of payment

amounts under Sec. 226.18(g)(1). In those transactions, the creditor need not disclose the total of payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(i) Demand feature.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements of this provision apply not only to transactions payable on demand from the outset, but also to transactions that are not payable on demand at the time of consummation but convert to a demand status after a stated period. In demand obligations in which the disclosures are based on an assumed maturity of 1 year under Sec. 226.17(c)(5), that fact must also be stated. Appendix H contains model clauses that may be used in making this disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Covered demand features. The type of demand feature triggering the disclosures required by Sec. 226.18(i) includes only those demand features contemplated by the parties as part of the legal obligation. For example, this provision does not apply to transactions that covert to a demand status as a result of the consumer's default. A due-on-sale clause is not considered a demand feature. A creditor may, but need not, treat its contractual right to demand payment of a loan made to its executive officers as a demand feature to the extent that the contractual right is required by Regulation O (12 CFR 215.5) or other federal law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to payment schedule disclosures. As provided in Sec. 226.18(g)(1), in demand obligations with no alternate maturity date, the creditor need only disclose the due dates or payment periods of any scheduled interest payments for the first year. If the demand obligation states an alternate maturity, however, the disclosed payment schedule must reflect that stated term; the special rule in Sec. 226.18(g)(1) is not available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(j) Total sale price.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In a credit sale transaction, the total sale price must be disclosed using that term, along with a descriptive explanation similar to the one in the regulation. For variable rate transactions, the descriptive phrase may, at the creditor's option, be modified to reflect the variable rate feature. For example, the descriptor may read: ``The total cost of your purchase on credit, which is subject to change, including your downpayment of * * *.'' The reference to a downpayment may be eliminated in transactions calling for no downpayment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of total sale price. The figure to be disclosed is the sum of the cash price, other charges added under Sec. 226.18(b)(2), and the finance charge disclosed under Sec. 226.18(d).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of existing liens. When a credit sale transaction involves property that is being used as a trade-in (an automobile, for example) and that has a lien exceeding the value of the trade-in, the total sale price is affected by the amount of any cash provided. (See comment 2(a)(18)-3.) To illustrate, assume a consumer finances the purchase of an automobile with a cash price of $20,000. Another vehicle used as a trade-in has a value of $8,000 but has an existing lien of $10,000, leaving a $2,000 deficit that the consumer must finance.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer pays $1,500 in cash, the creditor may apply the cash first to the lien, leaving a $500 deficit, and reflect a downpayment of $0. The total sale price would include the $20,000 cash price, an additional $500 financed under Sec. 226.18(b)(2), and the amount of the finance charge. Alternatively, the creditor may reflect a downpayment of $1,500 and finance the $2,000 deficit. In that case, the total sale price would include the sum of the $20,000 cash price, the $2,000 lien payoff amount as an additional amount financed, and the amount of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer pays $3,000 in cash, the creditor may apply the cash first to extinguish the lien and reflect the remainder as a downpayment of $1,000. The total sale price would reflect the $20,000 cash price and the amount of the finance charge. (The cash payment extinguishes the trade-in deficit and no charges are added under Sec. 226.18(b)(2).) Alternatively, the creditor may elect to reflect a downpayment of $3,000 and finance the $2,000 deficit. In that case, the total sale price would include the sum of the $20,000 cash price, the $2,000 lien payoff amount as an additional amount financed, and the amount of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k) Prepayment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must give a definitive statement of whether or not a penalty will be imposed or a rebate will be given.</p><p class="depth0">The fact that no penalty will be imposed may not simply be inferred from the absence of a penalty disclosure; the creditor must indicate that prepayment will not result in a penalty.</p><p class="depth0">If a penalty or refund is possible for one type of prepayment, even though not for all, a positive disclosure is required. This applies to any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or involuntary as in the case of prepayments resulting from acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">Any difference in rebate or penalty policy, depending on whether prepayment is voluntary or not, must not be disclosed with the segregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rebate-penalty disclosure. A single transaction may involve both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to the unpaid balance (for example, mortgages with mortgage-guarantee insurance). In these cases, disclosures about both prepayment rebates and penalties are required. Sample form H-15 in appendix H illustrates a mortgage transaction in which both rebate and penalty disclosures are necessary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepaid finance charge. The existence of a prepaid finance charge in a transaction does not, by itself, require a disclosure under Sec. 226.18(k). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a penalty under Sec. 226.18(k)(1), nor does it require a disclosure under Sec. 226.18(k)(2). At its option, however, a creditor may consider a prepaid finance charge to be under Sec. 226.18(k)(2). If a disclosure is made under Sec. 226.18(k)(2) with respect to a prepaid finance charge or other finance charge, the creditor may further identify that finance charge. For example, the disclosure may state that the borrower ``will not be entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance charge'' or some other term that describes the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Penalty. This applies only to those transactions in which the interest calculation takes account of all scheduled reductions in principal, as well as transactions in which interest calculations are made daily. The term penalty as used here encompasses only those charges that are assessed strictly because of the prepayment in full of a simple-interest obligation, as an addition to all other amounts. Items which are penalties include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Interest charges for any period after prepayment in full is made. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of interest charges assessed for periods after prepayment in full as directly related information.)</p><p class="depth0">A minimum finance charge in a simple-interest transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of a minimum finance charge as directly related information.) Items which are not penalties include, for example, loan guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rebate of finance charge. This applies to any finance charges that do not take account of each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation. This category includes, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Precomputed finance charges such as add-on charges.</p><p class="depth0">Charges that take account of some but not all reductions in principal, such as mortgage guarantee insurance assessed on the basis of an annual declining balance, when the principal is reduced on a monthly basis.
No description of the method of computing earned or unearned finance charges is required or permitted as part of the segregated disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(l) Late payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. This paragraph requires a disclosure only if charges are added to individual delinquent installments by a creditor who otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late payment charges do not include:</p><p class="depth0">The right of acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">Fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges or attorney's fees.</p><p class="depth0">Deferral and extension charges.</p><p class="depth0">The continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the payment due date. However, an increase in the interest rate is a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of disclosure. Many state laws authorize the calculation of late charges on the basis of either a percentage or a specified dollar amount, and permit imposition of the lesser or greater of the 2 charges. The disclosure made under Sec. 226.18(l) may reflect this alternative. For example, stating that the charge in the event of a late payment is 5% of the late amount, not to exceed $5.00, is sufficient. Many creditors also permit a grace period during which no late charge will be assessed; this fact may be disclosed as directly related information. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(m) Security interest.</p><p class="depth0">1. Purchase money transactions. When the collateral is the item purchased as part of, or with the proceeds of, the credit transaction, section 226.18(m) requires only a general identification such as ``the property purchased in this transaction.'' However, the creditor may identify the property by item or type instead of identifying it more generally with a phrase such as ``the property purchased in this transaction.'' For example, a creditor may identify collateral as ``a motor vehicle,'' or as ``the property purchased in this transaction.'' Any transaction in which the credit is being used to purchase the collateral is considered a purchase money transaction and the abbreviated identification may be used, whether the obligation is treated as a loan or a credit sale.</p><p class="depth0">2. Nonpurchase money transactions. In nonpurchase money transactions, the property subject to the security interest must be identified by item or type. This disclosure is satisfied by a general disclosure of the category of property subject to the security interest, such as ``motor vehicles,'' ``securities,'' ``certain household items,'' or ``household goods.'' (Creditors should be aware, however, that the Federal credit practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit certain security interests in household goods.) At the creditor's option, however, a more precise identification of the property or goods may be provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mixed collateral. In some transactions in which the credit is used to purchase the collateral, the creditor may also take other property of the consumer as security. In those cases, a combined disclosure must be provided, consisting of an identification of

the purchase money collateral consistent with comment 18(m)-1 and a specific identification of the other collateral consistent with comment 18(m)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. After-acquired property. An after-acquired property clause is not a security interest to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">5. Spreader clause. The fact that collateral for pre-existing credit with the institution is being used to secure the present obligation constitutes a security interest and must be disclosed. (Such security interests may be known as ``spreader'' or ``dragnet'' clauses, or as ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) A specific identification of that collateral is unnecessary but a reminder of the interest arising from the prior indebtedness is required. The disclosure may be made by using language such as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan.'' At the creditor's option, a more specific description of the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">6. Terms used in disclosure. No specified terminology is required in disclosing a security interest. Although the disclosure may, at the creditor's option, use the term security interest, the creditor may designate its interest by using, for example, pledge, lien, or mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">7. Collateral from third party. In certain transactions, the consumer's obligation may be secured by collateral belonging to a third party. For example, a loan to a student may be secured by an interest in the property of the student's parents. In such cases, the security interest is taken in connection with the transaction and must be disclosed, even though the property encumbered is owned by someone other than the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">18(n) Insurance and debt cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Location. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option, appear apart from the other disclosures. It may appear with any other information, including the amount financed itemization, any information prescribed by state law, or other supplementary material. When this information is disclosed with the other segregated disclosures, however, no additional explanatory material may be included.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debt cancellation. Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance under state law. Otherwise, they may provide a parallel disclosure that refers to debt cancellation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(o) Certain security interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Format. No special format is required for these disclosures; under Sec. 226.4(e), taxes and fees paid to government officials with respect to a security interest may be aggregated, or may be broken down by individual charge. For example, the disclosure could be labelled ``filing fees and taxes'' and all funds disbursed for such purposes may be aggregated in a single disclosure. This disclosure may appear, at the creditor's option, apart from the other required disclosures. The inclusion of this information on a statement required under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act is sufficient disclosure for purposes of Truth in Lending.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(p) Contract reference.</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. Creditors may substitute, for the phrase ``appropriate contract document,'' a reference to specific transaction documents in which the additional information is found, such as ``promissory note'' or ``retail installment sale contract.'' A creditor may, at its option, delete inapplicable items in the contract reference, as for example when the contract documents contain no information regarding the right of acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(q) Assumption policy.</p><p class="depth0">1. Policy statement. In many mortgages, the creditor cannot determine, at the time disclosure must be made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage, the disclosure under Sec. 226.18(q) should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such cases, the creditor may use phrases such as ``subject to conditions,'' ``under certain circumstances,'' or ``depending on future conditions.'' The creditor may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria such as a due-on-sale clause, although a complete explanation of all conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state, ``Someone buying your home may be allowed to assume the mortgage on its original terms, subject to certain conditions, such as payment of an assumption fee.'' See comment 17(a)(1)-5 for an example for a reference to a due-on-sale clause.</p><p class="depth0">2. Original terms. The phrase original terms for purposes of Sec. 226.18(q) does not preclude the imposition of an assumption fee, but a modification of the basic credit agreement, such as a change in the contract interest rate, represents different terms.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(r) Required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must inform the consumer of the existence of a required deposit. (appendix H provides a model clause that may be used in making that disclosure.) Footnote 45 describes 3 types of deposits that need not be considered required deposits. Use of the phrase ``need not'' permits creditors to include the disclosure even in cases where there is doubt as to whether the deposit constitutes a required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Pledged account mortgages. In these transactions, a consumer pledges as collateral funds that the consumer deposits in an account held by the creditor. The creditor withdraws sums from that account to supplement the consumer's periodic payments. Creditors may treat these pledged accounts as required deposits or they may treat them as consumer buydowns in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Escrow accounts. The escrow exception in footnote 45 applies, for example, to accounts for such items as maintenance fees, repairs, or improvements, whether in a realty or a nonrealty transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1) regarding the use of escrow accounts in consumer buydown transactions.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Interest-bearing accounts. When a deposit earns at least 5 percent interest per year, no disclosure is required under Sec. 226.18(r). This exception applies whether the deposit is held by the creditor or by a third party.</p><p class="depth0">5. Morris Plan transactions. A deposit under a Morris Plan, in which a deposit account is created for the sole purpose of accumulating payments and this is applied to satisfy entirely the consumer's obligation in the transaction, is not a required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples of amounts excluded. The following are among the types of deposits that need not be treated as required deposits:</p><p class="depth0">Requirement that a borrower be a customer or a member even if that involves a fee or a minimum balance.</p><p class="depth0">Required property insurance escrow on a mobile home transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Refund of interest when the obligation is paid in full.</p><p class="depth0">Deposits that are immediately available to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Funds deposited with the creditor to be disbursed (for example, for construction) before the loan proceeds are advanced.</p><p class="depth0">Escrow of condominium fees.</p><p class="depth0">Escrow of loan proceeds to be released when the repairs are completed.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 128, the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-320) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2602).</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.2, 226.17, and appendix H.</p><p class="depth0">Other regulations: 12 CFR 545.6-2(a) and 12 CFR Part 29.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Sections 226.4 and 226.8.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: Five of the required disclosures must be explained to the consumer in a manner similar to the descriptive phrases shown in the regulation. A written itemization of the amount financed need not be provided unless the consumer requests it. The finance charge must be provided in all transactions, including real estate transactions, but must be shown only as a total amount. The disclosed finance charge is considered accurate if it is within a specified range.</p><p class="depth0">The variable rate hypothetical is required in all variable rate transactions and may be either general or transaction-specific. The penalty and rebate disclosures in the event of prepayment have been modified and combined. The requirement of an explanation of how the rebates or penalties are computed has been eliminated. The late payment disclosure has also been narrowed to include only charges imposed before maturity for late payments.</p><p class="depth0">The information required in the security interest disclosure has been decreased by the deletion of the type of security interest and a reduction in the property description requirement. The disclosure of the required deposit is limited to a statement that the annual percentage rate does not reflect the required deposit; the presence of a required deposit has no effect on the annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">Two disclosure requirements have been added: A reference to the contract documents for additional information and, in a residential mortgage transaction, a statement of the creditor's assumption policy.</p><p class="depth0">18(s) Interest rate and payment summary for mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. Section 226.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for mortgage loans. The information in Sec. 226.18(s)(2)-(4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to Model Clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in Appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where Sec. 226.18(s)(2)-(4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word ``monthly'' but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as ``bi-weekly'' or ``quarterly.'' In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of Sec. 226.18(s) in Sec. 226.18(s)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortizing loans. Loans described as amortizing in Sec. Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i) and 226.18(s)(3) include interest-only loans if they do not also permit negative amortization. (For rules relating to loans with balloon payments, see Sec. 226.18(s)(5)). If an amortizing loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory

rate (less than the fully-indexed rate), creditors must provide a special explanation of introductory rates. See Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Negative amortization. For negative amortization loans, creditors must follow the rules in Sec. Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(ii) and 226.18(s)(4) in disclosing interest rates and monthly payments. Loans with negative amortization also require special explanatory disclosures about rates and payments. See Sec. 226.18(s)(6). Loans with negative amortization include ``payment option'' loans, in which the consumer is permitted to make minimum payments that will cover only some of the interest accruing each month. See also comment 17(c)(1)-12, regarding graduated-payment adjustable-rate mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2) Interest rates.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(i) Amortizing loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fixed rate loans--payment increases. Although the interest rate will not change after consummation for a fixed-rate loan, some fixed-rate loans may have periodic payments that increase after consummation. For example, the terms of the legal obligation may permit the consumer to make interest-only payments for a specified period such as the first five years after consummation. In such cases, the creditor must include the increased payment under Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(ii)(B) in the payment row, and must show the interest rate in the column for that payment, even though the rate has not changed since consummation. See also comment 17(c)(1)-13, regarding growth equity mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. Creditors must disclose more than one interest rate for adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages, in accordance with Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(B). Creditors must assume that an adjustable-rate mortgage's interest rate will increase after consummation as rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Maximum interest rate during first five years--adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. The creditor must disclose the maximum rate that could apply during the first five years after consummation. If there are no interest rate caps other than the maximum rate required under Sec. 226.30, then the creditor should disclose only the rate at consummation and the maximum rate. Such a table would have only two columns.</p><p class="depth0">i. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the creditor must take into account any interest rate caps when disclosing the maximum interest rate during the first five years. The creditor must also disclose the earliest date on which that adjustment may occur.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the transaction is a step-rate mortgage, the creditor should disclose the rate that will apply after consummation. For example, the legal obligation may provide that the rate is 6 percent for the first two years following consummation, and then increases to 7 percent for at least the next three years. The creditor should disclose the maximum rate during the first five years as 7 percent and the date on which the rate is scheduled to increase to 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Maximum interest rate at any time. The creditor must disclose the maximum rate that could apply at any time during the term of the loan and the earliest date on which the maximum rate could apply.</p><p class="depth0">i. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the creditor must take into account any interest rate caps in disclosing the maximum interest rate. For example, if the legal obligation provides that at each annual adjustment the rate may increase by no more than 2 percentage points, the creditor must take this limit into account in determining the earliest date on which the maximum possible rate may be reached.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For a step-rate mortgage, the creditor should disclose the highest rate that could apply under the terms of the legal obligation and the date on which that rate will first apply.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment increases. For some loans, the payment may increase following consummation for reasons unrelated to an interest rate adjustment. For example, an adjustable-rate mortgage may have an introductory fixed-rate for the first five years following consummation and permit the borrower to make interest-only payments for the first three years. The disclosure requirement of Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(C) applies to all amortizing loans, including interest-only loans, if the consumer's payment can increase in the manner described in Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i)(B), even if it is not the type of loan covered by Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i). Thus, Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(C) requires that the creditor disclose the interest rate that corresponds to the first payment that includes principal as well as interest, even though the interest rate will not adjust at that time. In such cases, if the loan is an interest-only loan, the creditor also must disclose the corresponding periodic payment pursuant to Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(ii). The table would show, from left to right: The interest rate and payment at consummation with the payment itemized to show that the payment is being applied to interest only; the interest rate and payment when the interest-only option ends; the maximum interest rate and payment during the first five years; and the maximum possible interest rate and payment. The disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(C) do not apply to minor payment variations resulting solely from the fact that months have different numbers of days.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(ii) Negative amortization loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate at consummation. In all cases the interest rate in effect at consummation must

be disclosed, even if it will apply only for a short period such as one month.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. The creditor must assume that interest rates rise as quickly as possible after consummation, in accordance with any interest rate caps under the legal obligation. For adjustable-rate mortgages with no rate caps except a life-time maximum, creditors must assume that the interest rate reaches the maximum at the first adjustment. For example, assume that the legal obligation provides for an interest rate at consummation of 1.5 percent. One month after consummation, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter, according to changes in the index. The consumer may make payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month, until the date the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance, or until the end of the fifth year after consummation, whichever comes first. The maximum possible rate is 10.5 percent. No other limits on interest rates apply. The minimum required payment adjusts each year, and may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The creditor should disclose the following rates and the dates when they are scheduled to occur: A rate of 1.5 percent for the first month following consummation and the minimum payment; a rate of 10.5 percent, and the corresponding minimum payment taking into account the 7.5 percent limit on payment increases, at the beginning of the second year; and a rate of 10.5 percent and the corresponding minimum payment taking into account the 7.5 percent payment increase limit, at the beginning of the third year. The creditor also must disclose the rate of 10.5 percent, the fully amortizing payment, and the date on which the consumer must first make such a payment under the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(iii) Introductory rate disclosure for amortizing adjustable-rate mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Introductory rate. In some adjustable-rate mortgages, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is lower than the fully-indexed rate at consummation. For amortizing loans with an introductory rate, creditors must disclose the information required in Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii) directly below the table.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Place in sequence. ``Designation of the place in sequence'' refers to identifying the month or year, as applicable, of the change in the rate resulting from the expiration of an introductory rate by its place in the sequence of months or years, as applicable, of the transaction's term. For example, if a transaction has a discounted rate for the first three years, Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii)(B) requires a statement such as, ``In the fourth year, even if market rates do not change, this rate will increase to ----%.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fully-indexed rate. The fully-indexed rate is defined in Sec. 226.18(s)(7) as the index plus the margin at consummation. For purposes of Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii)(C), ``at consummation'' refers to disclosures delivered at consummation, or three business days before consummation pursuant to Sec. 226.19(a)(2)(ii); for early disclosures delivered within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application pursuant to Sec. 226.19(a)(1), the fully-indexed rate disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii)(C) may be based on the index in effect at the time the disclosures are provided. The index in effect at consummation (or at the time of early disclosures) need not be used if a contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation (or any earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the fully-indexed rate to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(3) Payments for amortizing loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Payments corresponding to interest rates. Creditors must disclose the periodic payment that corresponds to each interest rate disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(A)-(C). The corresponding periodic payment is the regular payment for each such interest rate, without regard to any final payment that differs from others because of the rounding of periodic payments to account for payment amounts including fractions of cents. Balloon payments, however, must be disclosed as provided in Sec. 226.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">2. Principal and interest payment amounts; examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. For fixed-rate interest-only transactions, Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(ii)(B) requires scheduled increases in the regular periodic payment amounts to be disclosed along with the date of the increase. For example, in a fixed-rate interest-only loan, a scheduled increase in the payment amount from an interest-only payment to a fully amortizing payment must be disclosed. Similarly, in a fixed-rate balloon loan, the balloon payment must be disclosed in accordance with Sec. 226.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. For adjustable-rate mortgage transactions, Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i)(A) requires that for each interest rate required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i) (the interest rate at consummation, the maximum rate during the first five years, and the maximum possible rate) a corresponding payment amount must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The format of the payment disclosure varies depending on whether all regular periodic payment amounts will include principal and interest, and whether there will be an escrow account for taxes and insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Taxes and insurance. An estimated payment amount for taxes and insurance must be disclosed if the creditor will establish an

escrow account for such amounts. If the escrow account will include amounts for items other than taxes and insurance, such as homeowners association dues, the creditor may but is not required to include such items in the estimate. When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic mortgage insurance premiums that are known to the creditor at the time the disclosure is made. The estimated amounts of mortgage insurance premiums should be based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a result of changes to the interest rate that are assumed for purposes of disclosing those rates under Sec. 226.18(s)(2) and accompanying commentary. The payment amount must include estimated amounts for property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor, such as insurance against loss of or damage to property, or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the property, or insurance protecting the creditor against the consumer's default or other credit loss. Premiums for credit insurance, debt suspension and debt cancellation agreements, however, should not be included. Except for periodic mortgage insurance premiums included in the escrow payment under Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i)(C), amounts included in the escrow payment disclosure such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance generally are not finance charges under Sec. 226.4 and, therefore, do not affect other disclosures, including the finance charge and annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage insurance. Payment amounts under Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i) should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance payments until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment amount must reflect the terms of the legal obligation, as determined by applicable state or other law. For example, assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the creditor collects at closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is terminated, payment amounts disclosed through the 130th payment should reflect premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, payments disclosed through the 128th payment should reflect premium payments. The escrow amount reflected on the disclosure should include mortgage insurance premiums even if they are not escrowed and even if there is no escrow account established for the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Total monthly payment. For amortizing loans, each column should add up to a total estimated payment. The total estimated payment amount should be labeled. If periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term such as ``quarterly'' or ``annually.''</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(3)(ii) Interest-only payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest-only loans that are also negative amortization loans. The rules in Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(ii) for disclosing payments on interest-only loans apply only if the loan is not also a negative amortization loan. If the loan is a negative amortization loan, even if it also has an interest-only feature, payments are disclosed under the rules in Sec. 226.18(s)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrows. See the commentary under Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i)(C) for guidance on escrows for purposes of Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(4) Payments for negative amortization loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Table. Section 226.18(s)(1) provides that tables shall include only the information required in Sec. 226.18(s)(2)-(4). Thus, a table for a negative amortization loan must contain no more than two horizontal rows of payments and no more than five vertical columns of interest rates.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment amounts. The payment amounts disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(4) are the minimum or fully amortizing periodic payments, as applicable, corresponding to the interest rates disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(ii). The corresponding periodic payment is the regular payment for each such interest rate, without regard to any final payment that differs from the rest because of the rounding of periodic payments to account for payment amounts including fractions of cents.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum required payments. In one row of the table, the creditor must disclose the minimum required payment in each column of the table, corresponding to each interest rate or adjustment required in Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(ii). The payments in this row must be calculated based on an assumption that the consumer makes the minimum required payment for as long as possible under the terms of the legal obligation. This row should be identified as the minimum payment option, and the statement required by Sec. 226.18(s)(4)(i)(C) should be included in the heading for the row.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fully amortizing payments. In one row of the table, the creditor must disclose the fully amortizing payment in each column of the table, corresponding to each interest rate required in Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(ii). The creditor must assume, for purposes of calculating the

amounts in this row that the consumer makes only fully amortizing payments starting with the first scheduled payment.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(5) Balloon payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A balloon payment is one that is more than two times the regular periodic payment. In a reverse mortgage transaction, the single payment is not considered a balloon payment. A balloon payment must be disclosed outside and below the table, unless the balloon payment coincides with an interest rate adjustment or a scheduled payment increase. In those cases, the balloon payment must be disclosed in the table.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(6) Special disclosures for loans with negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrows. See the commentary under Sec. 226.18(s)(3)(i)(C) for guidance on escrows for purposes of Sec. 226.18(s)(6). Under that guidance, because mortgage insurance payments decline over a loan's term, the payment amounts shown in the table should reflect the mortgage insurance payment that will be applicable at the time each disclosed periodic payment will be in effect. Accordingly, the disclosed mortgage insurance payment will be zero if it corresponds to a periodic payment that will occur after the creditor will be legally required to terminate mortgage insurance. On the other hand, because only one escrow amount is disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(6) for negative amortization loans and escrows are not itemized in the payment amounts, the single escrow amount disclosed should reflect the mortgage insurance amount that will be collected at the outset of the loan's term, even though that amount will decline in the future and ultimately will be discontinued pursuant to the terms of the mortgage insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(7) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Negative amortization loans. Under Sec. 226.18(s)(7)(v), a negative amortization loan is one that requires only a minimum periodic payment that covers only a portion of the accrued interest, resulting in negative amortization. For such a loan, Sec. 226.18(s)(4)(iii) requires creditors to disclose the fully amortizing periodic payment for each interest rate disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(ii), in addition to the minimum periodic payment, regardless of whether the legal obligation explicitly recites that the consumer may make the fully amortizing payment. Some loan types that result in negative amortization do not meet the definition of negative amortization loan for purposes of Sec. 226.18(s). These include, for example, loans requiring level, amortizing payments but having a payment schedule containing gaps during which interest accrues and is added to the principal balance before regular, amortizing payments begin (or resume). For example, ``seasonal income'' loans may provide for amortizing payments during nine months of the year and no payments for the other three months; the required minimum payments (when made) are amortizing payments, thus such loans are not negative amortization loans under Sec. 226.18(s)(7)(v). An adjustable-rate loan that has fixed periodic payments that do not adjust when the interest rate adjusts also would not be disclosed as a negative amortization loan under Sec. 226.18(s). For example, assume the initial rate is 4%, for which the fully amortizing payment is $1500. Under the terms of the legal obligation, the consumer will make $1500 monthly payments even if the interest rate increases, and the additional interest is capitalized. The possibility (but not certainty) of negative amortization occurring after consummation does not make this transaction a negative amortization loan for purposes of Sec. 226.18(s). Loans that do not meet the definition of negative amortization loan, even if they may have negative amortization, are amortizing loans and are disclosed under Sec. Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i) and 226.18(s)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.19--Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(i) Time of disclosure</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This section requires early disclosure of credit terms in mortgage transactions that are secured by a consumer's dwelling (other than home equity lines of credit subject to Sec. 226.5b or mortgage transactions secured by an interest in a timeshare plan) that are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and its implementing Regulation X, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). To be covered by Sec. 226.19, a transaction must be a Federally related mortgage loan under RESPA. ``Federally related mortgage loan'' is defined under RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602) and Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2), and is subject to any interpretations by HUD.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing and use of estimates. The disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or mailed not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. The general definition of ``business day'' in Sec. 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially all of its business functions--is used for purposes of Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i). See comment 2(a)(6)-1. This general definition is consistent with the definition of ``business day'' in HUD's Regulation X--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions. See 24 CFR 3500.2. Accordingly, the three-business-day period in Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i) for making early disclosures coincides with the time period within which creditors subject to RESPA must provide good faith estimates of settlement costs. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base

the disclosures on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under Sec. 226.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as ``all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are estimates'') instead of separately labelling each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Written application. Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X (including any interpretations issued by HUD) in deciding whether a ``written application'' has been received. In general, Regulation X defines ``application'' to mean the submission of a borrower's financial information in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a Federally related mortgage loan. See 24 CFR 3500.2(b). An application is received when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are normally transmitted--by mail, hand delivery, or through an intermediary agent or broker. (See comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.) If an application reaches the creditor through an intermediary agent or broker, the application is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker.</p><p class="depth0">4. Denied or withdrawn applications. The creditor may determine within the three-business-day period that the application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, as, for example, when a consumer applies for a type or amount of credit that the creditor does not offer, or the consumer's application cannot be approved for some other reason. In that case, or if the consumer withdraws the application within the three-business-day period, the creditor need not make the disclosures under this section. If the creditor fails to provide early disclosures and the transaction is later consummated on the original terms, the creditor will be in violation of this provision. If, however, the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's unwillingness to approve it on its original terms, no violation occurs for not providing disclosures based on the original terms. But the amended application is a new application subject to Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">5. Itemization of amount financed. In many mortgage transactions, the itemization of the amount financed required by Sec. 226.18(c) will contain items, such as origination fees or points, that also must be disclosed as part of the good faith estimates of settlement costs required under RESPA. Creditors furnishing the RESPA good faith estimates need not give consumers any itemization of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(ii) Imposition of fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing of fees. The consumer must receive the disclosures required by this section before paying or incurring any fee imposed by a creditor or other person in connection with the consumer's application for a mortgage transaction that is subject to Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i), except as provided in Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(iii). If the creditor delivers the disclosures to the consumer in person, a fee may be imposed anytime after delivery. If the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the creditor may impose a fee after the consumer receives the disclosures or, in all cases, after midnight on the third business day following mailing of the disclosures. For purposes of Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(ii), the term ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and legal public holidays referred to in Sec. 226.2(a)(6). See Comment 2(a)(6)-2. For example, assuming that there are no intervening legal public holidays, a creditor that receives the consumer's written application on Monday and mails the early mortgage loan disclosure on Tuesday may impose a fee on the consumer after midnight on Friday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees restricted. A creditor or other person may not impose any fee, such as for an appraisal, underwriting, or broker services, until the consumer has received the disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i). The only exception to the fee restriction allows the creditor or other person to impose a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit history, such as for a credit report(s).</p><p class="depth0">3. Collection of fees. A creditor complies with Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(ii) if--</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditor receives a consumer's written application directly from the consumer and does not collect any fee, other than a fee for obtaining a consumer's credit history, until the consumer receives the early mortgage loan disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A third party submits a consumer's written application to a creditor and both the creditor and third party do not collect any fee, other than a fee for obtaining a consumer's credit history, until the consumer receives the early mortgage loan disclosure from the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A third party submits a consumer's written application to a second creditor following a prior creditor's denial of an application made by the same consumer (or following the consumer's withdrawal), and, if a fee already has been assessed, the new creditor or third party does not collect or impose any additional fee until the consumer receives an early mortgage loan disclosure from the new creditor.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(iii) Exception to fee restriction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. A creditor or other person may impose a fee before the consumer receives the required disclosures if it is for obtaining the consumer's credit history, such as by purchasing a credit report(s) on the consumer. The fee also must be bona fide and reasonable in amount. For example, a creditor may collect a fee for obtaining a credit report(s) if it is in the creditor's ordinary course of business to obtain a credit report(s). If the criteria in Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(iii) are met, the creditor may describe or refer to this fee, for example, as an ``application fee.''</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(2) Waiting period(s) required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Business day definition. For purposes of Sec. 226.19(a)(2), ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to in Sec. 226.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)-2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consummation after both waiting periods expire. Consummation may not occur until both the seven-business-day waiting period and the three-business-day waiting period have expired. For example, assume a creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, and the creditor then delivers corrected disclosures in person to the consumer on Wednesday, June 3. Although Saturday, June 6 is the third business day after the consumer received the corrected disclosures, consummation may not occur before Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(2)(i) Seven-business-day waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. The disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the seventh business day before consummation. The seven-business-day waiting period begins when the creditor delivers the early disclosures or places them in the mail, not when the consumer receives or is deemed to have received the early disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(2)(ii) Three-business-day waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions for redisclosure. If, at the time of consummation, the annual percentage rate disclosed is accurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor does not have to make corrected disclosures under Sec. 226.19(a)(2). If, on the other hand, the annual percentage rate disclosed is not accurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor must make corrected disclosures of all changed terms (including the annual percentage rate) so that the consumer receives them not later than the third business day before consummation. For example, assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a regular mortgage transaction disclose an annual percentage rate of 7.00%:</p><p class="depth0">i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10%. The creditor is not required to make corrected disclosures under Sec. 226.19(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15%. The creditor must make corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of new disclosures. If redisclosure is required, the creditor may provide a complete set of new disclosures, or may redisclose only the changed terms. If the creditor chooses to provide a complete set of new disclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight the new terms, provided that the disclosures comply with the format requirements of Sec. 226.17(a). If the creditor chooses to disclose only the new terms, all the new terms must be disclosed. For example, a different annual percentage rate will almost always produce a different finance charge, and often a new schedule of payments; all of these changes would have to be disclosed. If, in addition, unrelated terms such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those originally disclosed, the accurate terms must be disclosed. However, no new disclosures are required if the only inaccuracies involve estimates other than the annual percentage rate, and no variable rate feature has been added. For a discussion of the requirement to redisclose when a variable-rate feature is added, see comment 17(f)-2. For a discussion of redisclosure requirements in general, see the commentary on Sec. 226.17(f).</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing. When redisclosures are necessary because the annual percentage rate has become inaccurate, they must be received by the consumer no later than the third business day before consummation. (For redisclosures triggered by other events, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures before consummation. See Sec. 226.17(f).) If the creditor delivers the corrected disclosures to the consumer in person, consummation may occur any time on the third business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the corrected disclosures by mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining when the three-business-day waiting period required under Sec. 226.19(a)(2)(ii) begins. Creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than the postal service may also follow this approach.</p><p class="depth0">4. Basis for annual percentage rate comparison. To determine whether a creditor must make corrected disclosures under Sec. 226.22, a creditor compares (a) what the annual percentage rate will be at consummation to (b) the annual percentage rate stated in the most recent disclosures the creditor made to the consumer. For example, assume consummation for a regular mortgage transaction is scheduled for Thursday, June 11, the early disclosures provided in May stated an annual percentage rate of 7.00%, and corrected disclosures received by the consumer on Friday, June 5 stated an annual percentage rate of 7.15%:</p><p class="depth0">i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.25%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by less than the applicable tolerance. The creditor is not required to make additional corrected disclosures or wait an additional three business days under Sec. 226.19(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.30%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by more than the applicable tolerance. The creditor must make corrected disclosures such that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(3) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right to a waiting period required by Sec. 226.19(a)(2) only after the creditor makes the disclosures required by Sec. 226.18. The consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of waivers within the seven-business-day waiting period. Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1, and at that time the consumer executes a waiver of the seven-business-day waiting period (which would end on Tuesday, June 9) so that the loan can be consummated on Friday, June 5:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is inaccurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day waiting period in Sec. 226.19(a)(2)(ii). After the consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 5.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with Sec. 226.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on June 5 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional modification or waiver.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of waivers made after the seven-business-day waiting period. Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on Monday, June 1 and consummation is scheduled for Friday, June 19. On Wednesday, June 17, a change to the annual percentage rate occurs:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is inaccurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor must provide a corrected disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the three-business-day waiting period in Sec. 226.19(a)(2). After the consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate the transaction on Friday, June 19.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under Sec. 226.22, the creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent with Sec. 226.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on Friday, June 19 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional modification or waiver.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(4) Notice.</p><p class="depth0">1. Inclusion in other disclosures. The notice required by Sec. 226.19(a)(4) must be grouped together with the disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i) or Sec. 226.19(a)(2). See comment 17(a)(1)-2 for a discussion of the rules for segregating disclosures. In other cases, the notice set forth in Sec. 226.19(a)(4) may be disclosed together with or separately from the disclosures required under Sec. 226.18. See comment 17(a)(1)-5(xvi).</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(5)(ii) Time of disclosures for timeshare plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. A mortgage transaction secured by a consumer's interest in a ``timeshare plan,'' as defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), that is also a Federally related mortgage loan under RESPA is subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.19(a)(5) instead of the requirements of Sec. 226.19(a)(1) through Sec. 226.19(a)(4). See comment 19(a)(1)(i)-1. Early disclosures for transactions subject to Sec. 226.19(a)(5) must be given (a) before consummation or (b) within three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application, whichever is earlier. The general definition

of ``business day'' in Sec. 226.2(a)(6)--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially all of its business functions--applies for purposes of Sec. 226.19(a)(5)(ii). See comment 2(a)(6)-1. These timing requirements are different from the timing requirements under Sec. 226.19(a)(1)(i). Timeshare transactions covered by Sec. 226.19(a)(5) may be consummated any time after the disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(a)(5)(ii) are provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of estimates. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under Sec. 226.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as ``all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are estimates'') instead of separately labelling each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Written application. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-3 in determining whether a ``written application'' has been received.</p><p class="depth0">4. Denied or withdrawn applications. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-4 in determining that disclosures are not required by Sec. 226.19(a)(5)(ii) because the consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.</p><p class="depth0">5. Itemization of amount financed. For timeshare transactions, creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-5 in determining whether providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies the requirement of Sec. 226.18(c) to provide an itemization of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(5)(iii) Redisclosure for timeshare plans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation or settlement. For extensions of credit secured by a consumer's timeshare plan, when corrected disclosures are required, they must be given no later than ``consummation or settlement.'' ``Consummation'' is defined in Sec. 226.2(a). ``Settlement'' is defined in Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2(b)) and is subject to any interpretations issued by HUD. In some cases, a creditor may delay redisclosure until settlement, which may be at a time later than consummation. If a creditor chooses to redisclose at settlement, disclosures may be based on the terms in effect at settlement, rather than at consummation. For example, in a variable-rate transaction, a creditor may choose to base disclosures on the terms in effect at settlement, despite the general rule in comment 17(c)(1)-8 that variable-rate disclosures should be based on the terms in effect at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of new disclosures. Creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(2)(ii)-2 in determining the content of corrected disclosures required under Sec. 226.19(a)(5)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">19(b) Certain variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 226.19(b) applies to all closed-end variable-rate transactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. The requirements of this section apply not only to transactions financing the initial acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling, but also to any other closed-end variable-rate transaction secured by the principal dwelling. Closed-end variable-rate transactions that are not secured by the principal dwelling, or are secured by the principal dwelling but have a term of one year or less, are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.18(f)(1) rather than those of Sec. 226.19(b). (Furthermore, ``shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.18(f)(1) rather than those of Sec. 226.19(b) regardless of the general coverage of those sections.) For purposes of this section, the term of a variable-rate demand loan is determined in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(5). In determining whether a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the same creditor is covered under this section, the creditor may treat the construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with distinct terms to maturity or as a single combined transaction. For purposes of the disclosures required under Sec. 226.18, the creditor may nevertheless treat the two phases either as separate transactions or as a single combined transaction in accordance with Sec. 226.17(c)(6). Finally, in any assumption of a variable-rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year, disclosures need not be provided under Sec. Sec. 226.18(f)(2)(ii) or 226.19(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing. A creditor must give the disclosures required under this section at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">i. Intermediary agent or broker. In cases where a creditor receives a written application through an intermediary agent or broker, however, footnote 45b provides a substitute timing rule requiring the creditor to deliver the disclosures or place them in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. (See comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.) This three-day rule also applies

where the creditor takes an application over the telephone.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Telephone request. In cases where the consumer merely requests an application over the telephone, the creditor must include the early disclosures required under this section with the application that is sent to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mail solicitations. In cases where the creditor solicits applications through the mail, the creditor must also send the disclosures required under this section if an application form is included with the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Conversion. In cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a closed-end transaction subject to this section under a written agreement with the consumer, disclosures under this section may be given at the time of conversion. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.20(a) for information on the timing requirements for Sec. 226.19(b)(2) disclosures when a variable-rate feature is later added to a transaction.)</p><p class="depth0">v. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures required by this section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying this requirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">A. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;</p><p class="depth0">B. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0">C. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">D. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.</p><p class="depth0">Whatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Intermediary agent or broker. In certain transactions involving an ``intermediary agent or broker,'' a creditor may delay providing disclosures. A creditor may not delay providing disclosures in transactions involving either a legal agent (as determined by applicable law) or any other third party that is not an ``intermediary agent or broker.'' In determining whether or not a transaction involves an ``intermediary agent or broker'' the following factors should be considered:</p><p class="depth0">The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the creditor. The greater the percentage of total loan applications submitted by the broker in any given period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an ``intermediary agent or broker'' of the creditor during the next period.</p><p class="depth0">The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the broker. (This factor is applicable only if the creditor has such information.) The greater the percentage of total loan applications received by the broker that is submitted to a creditor in any given period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an ``intermediary agent or broker'' of the creditor during the next period.</p><p class="depth0">The amount of work (such as document preparation) the creditor expects to be done by the broker on an application based on the creditor's prior dealings with the broker and on the creditor's requirements for accepting applications, taking into consideration the customary practice of brokers in a particular area. The more work that the creditor expects the broker to do on an application, in excess of what is usually expected of a broker in that area, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an ``intermediary agent or broker'' of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">An example of an ``intermediary agent or broker'' is a broker who, customarily within a brief period of time after receiving an application, inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with whom the broker does business and submits the application to one of them. The broker is responsible for only a small percentage of the applications received by that creditor. During the time the broker has the application, it might request a credit report and an appraisal (or even prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular area).</p><p class="depth0">4. Other variable-rate regulations. Transactions in which the creditor is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure requirements of the variable-rate regulations of other Federal agencies are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 226.19(b), by virtue of footnote 45a, and are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 226.20(c), by virtue of footnote 45c. Those variable-rate regulations include the regulations issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and those issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The exception in footnotes 45a and

45c is also available to creditors that are required by state law to comply with the federal variable-rate regulations noted above and to creditors that are authorized by title VIII of the Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (12 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.) to make loans in accordance with those regulations. Creditors using this exception should comply with the timing requirements of those regulations rather than the timing requirements of Regulation Z in making the variable-rate disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5. Examples of variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following transactions, if they have a term greater than one year and are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, constitute variable-rate transactions subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.19(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Renewable balloon-payment instruments where the creditor is both unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest rate at the time of renewal. (See comment 17(c)(1)-11 for a discussion of conditions within a consumer's control in connection with renewable balloon-payment loans.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, and the note reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures under Sec. Sec. 226.19(b)(1) and 226.19(b)(2)(v), (viii), (ix), and (xii) are not applicable to such loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ``Price-level-adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation. The disclosures under Sec. 226.19(b)(1) are not applicable to such loans, nor are the following provisions to the extent they relate to the determination of the interest rate by the addition of a margin, changes in the interest rate, or interest rate discounts: Section 226.19(b)(2) (i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix). (See comments 20(c)-2 and 30-1 regarding the inapplicability of variable-rate adjustment notices and interest rate limitations to price-level-adjusted or similar mortgages.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a variable-rate feature are not considered variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitute. Creditors who wish to use publications other than the Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages must make a good faith determination that their brochures are suitable substitutes to the Consumer Handbook. A substitute is suitable if it is, at a minimum, comparable to the Consumer Handbook in substance and comprehensiveness. Creditors are permitted to provide more detailed information than is contained in the Consumer Handbook.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability. The Consumer Handbook need not be given for variable-rate transactions subject to this section in which the underlying interest rate is fixed. (See comment 19(b)-5 for an example of a variable-rate transaction where the underlying interest rate is fixed.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure for each variable-rate program. A creditor must provide disclosures to the consumer that fully describe each of the creditor's variable-rate loan programs in which the consumer expresses an interest. If a program is made available only to certain customers of an institution, a creditor need not provide disclosures for that program to other consumers who express a general interest in a creditor's ARM programs. Disclosures must be given at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. If program disclosures cannot be provided because a consumer expresses an interest in individually negotiating loan terms that are not generally offered, disclosures reflecting those terms may be provided as soon as reasonably possible after the terms have been decided upon, but not later than the time a non-refundable fee is paid. If a consumer who has received program disclosures subsequently expresses an interest in other available variable-rate programs subject to 226.19(b)(2), or the creditor and consumer decide on a program for which the consumer has not received disclosures, the creditor must provide appropriate disclosures as soon as reasonably possible. The creditor, of course, is permitted to give the consumer information about additional programs subject to Sec. 226.19(b) initially.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate loan program defined. i. Generally, if the identification, the presence or absence, or the exact value of a loan feature must be disclosed under this section, variable-rate loans that differ as to such features constitute separate loan programs. For example, separate loan programs would exist based on differences in any of the following loan features:</p><p class="depth0">A. The index or other formula used to calculate interest rate adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">B. The rules relating to changes in the index value, interest rate, payments, and loan balance.</p><p class="depth0">C. The presence or absence of, and the amount of, rate or payment caps.</p><p class="depth0">D. The presence of a demand feature.</p><p class="depth0">E. The possibility of negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">F. The possibility of interest rate carryover.</p><p class="depth0">G. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">H. The presence of a discount feature.</p><p class="depth0">I. In addition, if a loan feature must be taken into account in preparing the disclosures required by Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii), variable-rate loans that differ as to that feature constitute separate programs under Sec. 226.19(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If, however, a representative value may be given for a loan feature or the feature need not be disclosed under Sec. 226.19(b)(2), variable-rate loans that differ as to such features do not constitute separate loan programs. For example, separate programs would not exist based on differences in the following loan features:</p><p class="depth0">A. The amount of a discount.</p><p class="depth0">B. The amount of a margin.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of program disclosures. A creditor may provide separate program disclosure forms for each ARM program it offers or a single disclosure form that describes multiple programs. A disclosure form may consist of more than one page. For example, a creditor may attach a separate page containing the historical payment example for a particular program. A disclosure form describing more than one program need not repeat information applicable to each program that is described. For example, a form describing multiple programs may disclose the information applicable to all of the programs in one place with the various program features (such as options permitting conversion to a fixed rate) disclosed separately. The form, however, must state if any program feature that is described is available only in conjunction with certain other program features. Both the separate and multiple program disclosures may illustrate more than one loan maturity or payment amortization--for example, by including multiple payment and loan balance columns in the historical payment example. Disclosures may be inserted or printed in the Consumer Handbook (or a suitable substitute) as long as they are identified as the creditor's loan program disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. As applicable. The disclosures required by this section need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated. For example, if the transaction does not contain a demand feature, the disclosure required under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(x) need not be given. As used in this section, payment refers only to a payment based on the interest rate, loan balance and loan term, and does not refer to payment of other elements such as mortgage insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">5. Revisions. A creditor must revise the disclosures required under this section once a year as soon as reasonably possible after the new index value becomes available. Revisions to the disclosures also are required when the loan program changes.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in interest rate, payment, or term. A creditor must disclose the fact that the terms of the legal obligation permit the creditor, after consummation of the transaction, to increase (or decrease) the interest rate, payment, or term of the loan initially disclosed to the consumer. For example, the disclosures for a variable-rate program in which the interest rate and payment (but not loan term) can change might read, ``Your interest rate and payment can change yearly.'' In transactions where the term of the loan may change due to rate fluctuations, the creditor must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of index or formula. If a creditor ties interest rate changes to a particular index, this fact must be disclosed, along with a source of information about the index. For example, if a creditor uses the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity as its index, the disclosure might read, ``Your index is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year published weekly in the Wall Street Journal.'' If no particular index is used, the creditor must briefly describe the formula used to calculate interest rate changes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes at creditor's discretion. If interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion, this fact must be disclosed. If an index is internally defined, such as by a creditor's prime rate, the creditor should either briefly describe that index or state that interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of interest rate and payment. This provision requires an explanation of how the creditor will determine the consumer's interest rate and payment. In cases where a creditor bases its interest rate on a specific index and adjusts the index through the addition of a margin, for example, the disclosure might read, ``Your interest rate is based on the index plus a margin, and your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and remaining loan term.'' In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor must disclose this fact. For example, the disclosure might read, ``Your periodic payments will not fully amortize your loan and you will be required to make a single payment of the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance at the end of the loan term.'' The creditor, however, need not reflect any irregular final payment in the historical example or in the disclosure of the initial and maximum rates and payments. If applicable, the creditor should also disclose that the rate and payment will be rounded.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Current margin value and interest rate. Because the disclosures can be prepared in advance, the interest rate and margin may be several months old when the disclosures are delivered. A statement, therefore, is required alerting consumers to the fact that they should inquire about the current margin value applied to the index and the current interest rate. For example, the disclosure might state, ``Ask us for our current interest rate and margin.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Discounted and premium interest rate. In some variable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. If the initial interest rate will be a discount or a premium rate, creditors must alert the consumer to this fact. For example, if a creditor discounted a consumer's initial rate, the disclosure might state, ``Your initial interest rate is not based on the index used to make later adjustments.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1) for a further discussion of discounted and premium variable-rate transactions.) In addition, the disclosure must suggest that consumers inquire about the amount that the program is currently discounted. For example, the disclosure might state, ``Ask us for the amount our adjustable rate mortgages are currently discounted.'' In a transaction with a consumer buydown or with a third-party buydown that will be incorporated in the legal obligation, the creditor should disclose the program as a discounted variable-rate transaction, but need not disclose additional information regarding the buydown in its program disclosures. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii) for a discussion of how to reflect the discount or premium in the historical example or the maximum rate and payment disclosure).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Frequency. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments must be disclosed. If interest rate changes will be imposed more frequently or at different intervals than payment changes, a creditor must disclose the frequency and timing of both types of changes. For example, in a variable-rate transaction where interest rate changes are made monthly, but payment changes occur on an annual basis, this fact must be disclosed. In certain ARM transactions, the interval between loan closing and the initial adjustment is not known and may be different from the regular interval for adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may disclose the initial adjustment period as a range of the minimum and maximum amount of time from consummation or closing. For example, the creditor might state: ``The first adjustment to your interest rate and payment will occur no sooner than 6 months and no later than 18 months after closing. Subsequent adjustments may occur once each year after the first adjustment.'' (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for guidance on other disclosures when this alternative disclosure rule is used.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate and payment caps. The creditor must disclose limits on changes (increases or decreases) in the interest rate or payment. If an initial discount is not taken into account in applying overall or periodic rate limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate overall or periodic limitations apply to interest rate increases resulting from other events, such as the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations must also be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations. (See Sec. 226.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum interest rate be included in certain variable-rate transactions.) The creditor need not disclose each periodic or overall rate limitation that is currently available. As an alternative, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and overall rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's ARM transactions. For example, the creditor might state: ``The limitation on increases to your interest rate at each adjustment will be set at an amount in the following range: Between 1 and 2 percentage points at each adjustment. The limitation on increases to your interest rate over the term of the loan will be set at an amount in the following range: Between 4 and 7 percentage points above the initial interest rate.'' A creditor using this alternative rule must include a statement in its program disclosures suggesting that the consumer ask about the overall rate limitations currently offered for the creditor's ARM programs. (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-6 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the additional requirements for a creditor using this alternative rule for disclosure of periodic and overall rate limitations.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization and interest rate carryover. A creditor must disclose, where applicable, the possibility of negative amortization. For example, the disclosure might state, ``If any of your payments is not sufficient to cover the interest due, the difference will be added to your loan amount.'' Loans that provide for more than one way to trigger negative amortization are separate variable-rate programs requiring separate disclosures. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.19(b)(2) for a discussion on the definition of a variable-rate loan program and the format for disclosure.) If a consumer is given the option to cap monthly payments that may result in

negative amortization, the creditor must fully disclose the rules relating to the option, including the effects of exercising the option (such as negative amortization will occur and the principal loan balance will increase); however, the disclosure in Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii) need not be provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Conversion option. If a loan program permits consumers to convert their variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans, the creditor must disclose that the interest rate may increase if the consumer converts the loan to a fixed-rate loan. The creditor must also disclose the rules relating to the conversion feature, such as the period during which the loan may be converted, that fees may be charged at conversion, and how the fixed rate will be determined. The creditor should identify any index or other measure or formula used to determine the fixed rate and state any margin to be added. In disclosing the period during which the loan may be converted and the margin, the creditor may use information applicable to the conversion feature during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures and state that the information is representative of conversion features recently offered by the creditor. The information may be used until the program disclosures are otherwise revised. Although the rules relating to the conversion option must be disclosed, the effect of exercising the option should not be reflected elsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example or in the calculation of the initial and maximum interest rate and payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Preferred-rate loans. Section 226.19(b) applies to preferred-rate loans, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the creditor's employ, whether or not the underlying rate is fixed or variable. In these transactions, the creditor must disclose the event that would allow the creditor to increase the rate such as that the rate may increase if the employee leaves the creditor's employ. The creditor must also disclose the rules relating to termination of the preferred rate, such as that fees may be charged when the rate is changed and how the new rate will be determined.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Historical example and initial and maximum interest rates and payments. A creditor may disclose both the historical example and the initial and maximum interest rates and payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Index movement. This section requires a creditor to provide an historical example, based on a $10,000 loan amount originating in 1977, showing how interest rate changes implemented according to the terms of the loan program would have affected payments and the loan balance at the end of each year during a 15-year period. (In all cases, the creditor need only calculate the payments and loan balance for the term of the loan. For example, in a five-year loan, a creditor would show the payments and loan balance for the five-year term, from 1977 to 1981, with a zero loan balance reflected for 1981. For the remaining ten years, 1982-1991, the creditor need only show the remaining index values, margin and interest rate and must continue to reflect all significant loan program terms such as rate limitations affecting them.) Pursuant to this section, the creditor must provide a history of index values for the preceding 15 years. Initially, the disclosures would give the index values from 1977 to the present. Each year thereafter, the revised program disclosures should include an additional year's index value until 15 years of values are shown. If the values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far as the values are available in giving a history and payment example. In all cases, only one index value per year need be shown. Thus, in transactions where interest rate adjustments are implemented more frequently than once per year, a creditor may assume that the interest rate and payment resulting from the index value chosen will stay in effect for the entire year for purposes of calculating the loan balance as of the end of the year and for reflecting other loan program terms. In cases where interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion (see the commentary to Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(ii)), the creditor must provide a history of the rates imposed for the preceding 15 years, beginning with the rates in 1977. In giving this history, the creditor need only go back as far as the creditor's rates can reasonably be determined.</p><p class="depth0">2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect the method by which index values are determined under the program. If a creditor uses an average of index values or any other index formula, the history given should reflect those values. The creditor should select one date or, when an average of single values is used as an index, one period and should base the example on index values measured as of that same date or period for each year shown in the history. A date or period at any time during the year may be selected, but the same date or period must be used for each year in the historical example. For example, a creditor could use values for the first business day in July or for the first week ending in July for each of the 15 years shown in the example.</p><p class="depth0">3. Selection of margin. For purposes of the disclosure required under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a representative margin that has been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the margin is one that the creditor has used recently. The margin selected may be used until a creditor revises the disclosure form.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amount of discount or premium. For purposes of the disclosure required under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a discount or premium (amount and term) that has been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used recently. The discount or premium should be reflected in the historical example for as long as the discount or premium is in effect. A creditor may assume that a discount that would have been in effect for any part of a year was in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the historical example. For example, a 3-month discount may be treated as being in effect for the entire first year of the example; a 15-month discount may be treated as being in effect for the first two years of the example. In illustrating the effect of the discount or premium, creditors should adjust the value of the interest rate in the historical example, and should not adjust the margin or index values. For example, if during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures the fully indexed rate would have been 10% but the first year's rate under the program was 8%, the creditor would discount the first interest rate in the historical example by 2 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">5. Term of the loan. In calculating the payments and loan balances in the historical example, a creditor need not base the disclosures on each term to maturity or payment amortization that it offers. Instead, disclosures for ARMs may be based upon terms to maturity or payment amortizations of 5, 15 and 30 years, as follows: ARMs with terms or amortizations from over 1 year to 10 years may be based on a 5-year term or amortization; ARMs with terms or amortizations from over 10 years to 20 years may be based on a 15-year term or amortization; and ARMs with terms or amortizations over 20 years may be based on a 30-year term or amortization. Thus, disclosures for ARMs offered with any term from over 1 year to 40 years may be based solely on terms of 5, 15 and 30 years. Of course, a creditor may always base the disclosures on the actual terms or amortizations offered. If the creditor bases the disclosures on 5-, 15- or 30-year terms or payment amortization as provided above, the term or payment amortization used in making the disclosure must be stated.</p><p class="depth0">6. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 for disclosure of rate limitations must base the historical example upon the highest periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under section 226.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the limitations used in the historical example. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the use of the highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">7. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, creditors may use the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1 for disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may assume for purposes of the historical example that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first full year in which the adjustment could occur. For example, in an ARM in which the first adjustment may occur between 6 and 18 months after closing and annually thereafter, the creditor may assume that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first year in the historical example. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for an explanation of how to compute the maximum interest rate and payment when the initial adjustment period is not known.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial and maximum interest rates and payments. The disclosure form must state the initial and maximum interest rates and payments for a $10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate (index value plus margin adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure. (See comment 19(b)(2)-5 on revisions to the loan program disclosure.) In calculating the maximum payment under this paragraph, a creditor should assume that the interest rate increases as rapidly as possible under the loan program, and the maximum payment disclosed should reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. Thus, in a loan with 2 percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or ``caps,'' the maximum interest rate would be 5 percentage points higher than the initial interest rate disclosed. Moreover, the loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until the fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the maximum payment disclosed would reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. If the loan program includes a discounted or premium initial interest rate, the initial interest rate should be adjusted by the amount of the discount or premium.</p><p class="depth0">2. Term of the loan. In calculating the initial and maximum payments, the creditor need not base the disclosures on each term to maturity or payment amortization offered under the program. Instead, the creditor may follow the rules set out in comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-5.</p><p class="depth0">If a historical example is provided under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), the terms to maturity or payment amortization used in the historical example must be used in calculating the initial and maximum payment. In addition, creditors must state the term or payment amortization used in making the disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule for disclosure of interest rate

limitations described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 must calculate the maximum interest rate and payment based upon the highest periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the rate limitations used in calculating the maximum interest rate and payment. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-6 for an explanation of the use of the highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, a creditor may use the alternative rule for disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1. In such cases, the creditor must base the calculations of the initial and maximum rates and payments upon the earliest possible first adjustment disclosed under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(vi). (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 for an explanation of how to disclose the historical example when the initial adjustment period is not known.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Periodic payment statement. The statement that the periodic payment may increase or decrease substantially may be satisfied by the disclosure in paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi) if it states for example, ``your monthly payment can increase or decrease substantially based on annual changes in the interest rate.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(ix).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of payments. A creditor is required to include a statement on the disclosure form that explains how a consumer may calculate his or her actual monthly payments for a loan amount other than $10,000. The example should be based upon the most recent payment shown in the historical example or upon the initial interest rate reflected in the maximum rate and payment disclosure. In transactions in which the latest payment shown in the historical example is not for the latest year of index values shown (such as in a five-year loan), a creditor may provide additional examples based on the initial and maximum payments disclosed under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B). The creditor, however, is not required to calculate the consumer's payments. (See the model clauses in appendix H-4(C).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(x).</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand feature. If a variable-rate loan subject to Sec. 226.19(b) requirements contains a demand feature as discussed in the commentary to Sec. 226.18(i), this fact must be disclosed. (Pursuant to Sec. 226.18(i), creditors would also disclose the demand feature in the standard disclosures given later.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(xi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustment notices. A creditor must disclose to the consumer the type of information that will be contained in subsequent notices of adjustments and when such notices will be provided. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.20(c) regarding notices of adjustments.) For example, the disclosure might state, ``You will be notified at least 25, but no more than 120, days before the due date of a payment at a new level. This notice will contain information about the index and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance.'' In transactions where there may be interest rate adjustments without accompanying payment adjustments in a year, the disclosure might read, ``You will be notified once each year during which interest rate adjustments, but no payment adjustments, have been made to your loan. This notice will contain information about the index and interest rates, payment amount, and loan balance.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(xii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple loan programs. A creditor that offers multiple variable-rate loan programs is required to have disclosures for each variable-rate loan program subject to Sec. 226.19(b)(2). Unless disclosures for all of its variable-rate programs are provided initially, the creditor must inform the consumer that other closed-end variable-rate programs exist, and that disclosure forms are available for these additional loan programs. For example, the disclosure form might state, ``Information on other adjustable rate mortgage programs is available upon request.''</p><p class="depth0">19(c) Electronic disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses an ARM loan application electronically (other than as described under ii. below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses an ARM loan application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 128(b)(2) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2602).</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.2, 226.17, and 226.22.</p><p class="depth0">Other regulations: Regulation X (24 CFR 3500.2(a), 3500.5(b), and 3500.6(a)).</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: None.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: This section implements section 128(b)(2), a new provision that requires early disclosure of credit terms in certain mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.20 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a) Refinancings.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. A refinancing is a new transaction requiring a complete new set of disclosures. Whether a refinancing has occurred is determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been satisfied or extinguished and replaced by a new obligation, based on the parties' contract and applicable law. The refinancing may involve the consolidation of several existing obligations, disbursement of new money to the consumer or on the consumer's behalf, or the rescheduling of payments under an existing obligation. In any form, the new obligation must completely replace the prior one.</p><p class="depth0">Changes in the terms of an existing obligation, such as the deferral of individual installments, will not constitute a refinancing unless accomplished by the cancellation of that obligation and the substitution of a new obligation.</p><p class="depth0">A substitution of agreements that meets the refinancing definition will require new disclosures, even if the substitution does not substantially alter the prior credit terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exceptions. A transaction is subject to Sec. 226.20(a) only if it meets the general definition of a refinancing. Section 226.20(a) (1) through (5) lists 5 events that are not treated as refinancings, even if they are accomplished by cancellation of the old obligation and substitution of a new one.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a variable-rate feature was properly disclosed under the regulation, a rate change in accord with those disclosures is not a refinancing. For example, no new disclosures are required when the variable-rate feature is invoked on a renewable balloon-payment mortgage that was previously disclosed as a variable-rate transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Even if it is not accomplished by the cancellation of the old obligation and substitution of a new one, a new transaction subject to new disclosures results if the creditor either:</p><p class="depth0">A. Increases the rate based on a variable-rate feature that was not previously disclosed; or</p><p class="depth0">B. Adds a variable-rate feature to the obligation. A creditor does not add a variable-rate feature by changing the index of a variable-rate transaction to a comparable index, whether the change replaces the existing index or substitutes an index for one that no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If either of the events in paragraph 20(a)3.ii.A. or ii.B. occurs in a transaction secured by a principal dwelling with a term longer than one year, the disclosures required under Sec. 226.19(b) also must be given at that time.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unearned finance charge. In a transaction involving precomputed finance charges, the creditor must include in the finance charge on the refinanced obligation any unearned portion of the original finance charge that is not rebated to the consumer or credited against the underlying obligation. For example, in a transaction with an add-on finance charge, a creditor advances new money to a consumer in a fashion that extinguishes the original obligation and replaces it with a new one. The creditor neither refunds the unearned finance charge on the original obligation to the consumer nor credits it to the remaining balance on the old obligation. Under these circumstances, the unearned finance charge must be included in the finance charge on the new obligation and reflected in the annual percentage rate disclosed on refinancing. Accrued but unpaid finance charges are included in the amount financed in the new obligation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Coverage. Section 226.20(a) applies only to refinancings undertaken by the original creditor or a holder or servicer of the original obligation. A ``refinancing'' by any other person is a new transaction under the regulation, not a refinancing under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Renewal. This exception applies both to obligations with a single payment of principal and interest and to obligations with periodic payments of interest and a final payment of principal. In determining whether a new obligation replacing an old one is a renewal of the original terms or a refinancing, the creditor may consider it a renewal even if:</p><p class="depth0">Accrued unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">Changes are made in the terms of renewal resulting from the factors listed in Sec. 226.17(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">The principal at renewal is reduced by a curtailment of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Annual percentage rate reduction. A reduction in the annual percentage rate with a corresponding change in the payment schedule is not a refinancing. If the annual percentage rate is subsequently increased (even though it remains below its original level) and the increase is effected in such a way that the old obligation is satisfied and replaced, new disclosures must then be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Corresponding change. A corresponding change in the payment schedule to implement a lower annual percentage rate would be a shortening of the maturity, or a reduction in the payment amount or the number of payments of an obligation. The exception in Sec. 226.20(a)(2) does not apply if the maturity is lengthened, or if the payment amount or

number of payments is increased beyond that remaining on the existing transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Court agreements. This exception includes, for example, agreements such as reaffirmations of debts discharged in bankruptcy, settlement agreements, and post-judgment agreements. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.2(a)(14) for a discussion of court-approved agreements that are not considered ``credit.'')</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Workout agreements. A workout agreement is not a refinancing unless the annual percentage rate is increased or additional credit is advanced beyond amounts already accrued plus insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Insurance renewal. The renewal of optional insurance added to an existing credit transaction is not a refinancing, assuming that appropriate Truth in Lending disclosures were provided for the initial purchase of the insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(b) Assumptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. General definition. An assumption as defined in Sec. 226.20(b) is a new transaction and new disclosures must be made to the subsequent consumer. An assumption under the regulation requires the following three elements:</p><p class="depth0">A residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">An express acceptance of the subsequent consumer by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">A written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">The assumption of a nonexempt consumer credit obligation requires no disclosures unless all three elements are present. For example, an automobile dealer need not provide Truth in Lending disclosures to a customer who assumes an existing obligation secured by an automobile. However, a residential mortgage transaction with the elements described in Sec. 226.20(b) is an assumption that calls for new disclosures; the disclosures must be given whether or not the assumption is accompanied by changes in the terms of the obligation. (See comment 2(a)(24)-5 for a discussion of assumptions that are not considered residential mortgage transactions.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Existing residential mortgage transaction. A transaction may be a residential mortgage transaction as to one consumer and not to the other consumer. In that case, the creditor must look to the assuming consumer in determining whether a residential mortgage transaction exists. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">The original consumer obtained a mortgage to purchase a home for vacation purposes. The loan was not a residential mortgage transaction as to that consumer. The mortgage is assumed by a consumer who will use the home as a principal dwelling. As to that consumer, the loan is a residential mortgage transaction. For purposes of Sec. 226.20(b), the assumed loan is an ``existing residential mortgage transaction'' requiring disclosures, if the other criteria for an assumption are met.</p><p class="depth0">3. Express agreement. Expressly agrees means that the creditor's agreement must relate specifically to the new debtor and must unequivocally accept that debtor as a primary obligor. The following events are not construed to be express agreements between the creditor and the subsequent consumer:</p><p class="depth0">Approval of creditworthiness.</p><p class="depth0">Notification of a change in records.</p><p class="depth0">Mailing of a coupon book to the subsequent consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Acceptance of payments from the new consumer.</p><p class="depth0">4. Retention of original consumer. The retention of the original consumer as an obligor in some capacity does not prevent the change from being an assumption, provided the new consumer becomes a primary obligor. But the mere addition of a guarantor to an obligation for which the original consumer remains primarily liable does not give rise to an assumption. However, if neither party is designated as the primary obligor but the creditor accepts payment from the subsequent consumer, an assumption exists for purposes of Sec. 226.20(b).</p><p class="depth0">5. Status of parties. Section 226.20(b) applies only if the previous debtor was a consumer and the obligation is assumed by another consumer. It does not apply, for example, when an individual takes over the obligation of a corporation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Disclosures. For transactions that are assumptions within this provision, the creditor must make disclosures based on the ``remaining obligation.'' For example:</p><p class="depth0">The amount financed is the remaining principal balance plus any arrearages or other accrued charges from the original transaction.</p><p class="depth0">If the finance charge is computed from time to time by application of a percentage rate to an unpaid balance, in determining the amount of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate to be disclosed, the creditor should disregard any prepaid finance charges paid by the original obligor, but must include in the finance charge any prepaid finance charge imposed in connection with the assumption.</p><p class="depth0">If the creditor requires the assuming consumer to pay any charges as a condition of the assumption, those sums are prepaid finance charges as to that consumer, unless exempt from the finance charge under Sec. 226.4. If a transaction involves add-on or discount finance charges, the creditor may make abbreviated disclosures, as outlined in Sec. 226.20(b) (1) through (5). Creditors providing disclosures pursuant to this section for assumptions of variable-rate transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling

with a term longer than one year need not provide new disclosures under Sec. 226.18(f)(2)(ii) or Sec. 226.19(b). In such transactions, a creditor may disclose the variable-rate feature solely in accordance with Sec. 226.18(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">7. Abbreviated disclosures. The abbreviated disclosures permitted for assumptions of transactions involving add-on or discount finance charges must be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in a form that the consumer may keep. However, the creditor need not comply with the segregation requirement of Sec. 226.17(a)(1). The terms annual percentage rate and total of payments, when disclosed according to Sec. 226.20(b) (4) and (5), are not subject to the description requirements of Sec. 226.18 (e) and (h). The term annual percentage rate disclosed under Sec. 226.20(b)(4) need not be more conspicuous than other disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c) Variable-rate adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing of adjustment notices. This section requires a creditor (or a subsequent holder) to provide certain disclosures in cases where an adjustment to the interest rate is made in a variable-rate transaction subject to Sec. 226.19(b). There are two timing rules, depending on whether payment changes accompany interest rate changes. A creditor is required to provide at least one notice each year during which interest rate adjustments have occurred without accompanying payment adjustments. For payment adjustments, a creditor must deliver or place in the mail notices to borrowers at least 25, but not more than 120, calendar days before a payment at a new level is due. The timing rules also apply to the notice required to be given in connection with the adjustment to the rate and payment that follows conversion of a transaction subject to Sec. 226.19(b) to a fixed-rate transaction. (In cases where an open-end account is converted to a closed-end transaction subject to Sec. 226.19(b), the requirements of this section do not apply until adjustments are made following conversion.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Exceptions. Section 226.20(c) does not apply to ``shared-equity,'' ``shared-appreciation,'' or ``price level adjusted'' or similar mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">3. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures required under this section shall reflect the terms of the parties' legal obligation, as required under Sec. 226.17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Current and prior interest rates. The requirements under this paragraph are satisfied by disclosing the interest rate used to compute the new adjusted payment amount (``current rate'') and the adjusted interest rate that was disclosed in the last adjustment notice, as well as all other interest rates applied to the transaction in the period since the last notice (``prior rates''). (If there has been no prior adjustment notice, the prior rates are the interest rate applicable to the transaction at consummation, as well as all other interest rates applied to the transaction in the period since consummation.) If no payment adjustment has been made in a year, the current rate is the new adjusted interest rate for the transaction, and the prior rates are the adjusted interest rate applicable to the loan at the time of the last adjustment notice, and all other rates applied to the transaction in the period between the current and last adjustment notices. In disclosing all other rates applied to the transaction during the period between notices, a creditor may disclose a range of the highest and lowest rates applied during that period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Current and prior index values. This section requires disclosure of the index or formula values used to compute the current and prior interest rates disclosed in Sec. 226.20(c)(1). The creditor need not disclose the margin used in computing the rates. If the prior interest rate was not based on an index or formula value, the creditor also need not disclose the value of the index that would otherwise have been used to compute the prior interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Unapplied index increases. The requirement that the consumer receive information about the extent to which the creditor has foregone any increase in the interest rate is applicable only to those transactions permitting interest rate carryover. The amount of increase that is foregone at an adjustment is the amount that, subject to rate caps, can be applied to future adjustments independently to increase, or offset decreases in, the rate that is determined according to the index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Contractual effects of the adjustment. The contractual effects of an interest rate adjustment must be disclosed including the payment due after the adjustment is made whether or not the payment has been adjusted. A contractual effect of a rate adjustment would include, for example, disclosure of any change in the term or maturity of the loan if the change resulted from the rate adjustment. In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the amount of the adjusted payment must be disclosed if such payment has changed as a result of the rate adjustment. A statement of the loan balance also is required. The balance required to be disclosed is the balance on which the new adjusted payment is based. If no payment adjustment is disclosed in the notice, the balance disclosed should be the loan balance on which the payment disclosed under Sec. 226.20(c)(5) is based, if applicable, or the balance at the time the disclosure is prepared.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fully-amortizing payment. This paragraph requires a disclosure only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the adjustment. A disclosure is not required simply because a loan calls for non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments. For example, in a transaction with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor would not have to disclose the payment necessary to fully amortize the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is required, however, if the payment disclosed under Sec. 226.20(c)(4) is not sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan. The adjustment notice must state the payment required to prevent negative amortization. (This paragraph does not apply if the payment disclosed in Sec. 226.20(c)(4) is sufficient to prevent negative amortization in the loan but the final payment will be a different amount due to rounding.)</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: None.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.2.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.8(j) through (l), and Interpretation Sections 226.807, 226.811, 226.814, and 226.817.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: While the previous regulation treated virtually any change in terms as a refinancing requiring new disclosures, this regulation limits refinancings to transactions in which the entire original obligation is extinguished and replaced by a new one. Redisclosure is no longer required for deferrals or extensions.</p><p class="depth0">The assumption provision retains the substance of Sec. 226.8(k) and Interpretation Sec. 226.807 of the previous regulation, but limits its scope to residential mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.21--Treatment of Credit Balances</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(a).</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balance. A credit balance arises whenever the creditor receives or holds funds in an account in excess of the total balance due from the consumer on that account. A balance might result, for example, from the debtor's paying off a loan by transmitting funds in excess of the total balance owed on the account, or from the early payoff of a loan entitling the consumer to a rebate of insurance premiums and finance charges. However, Sec. 226.21 does not determine whether the creditor in fact owes or holds sums for the consumer. For example, if a creditor has no obligation to rebate any portion of precomputed finance charges on prepayment, the consumer's early payoff would not create a credit balance with respect to those charges. Similarly, nothing in this provision interferes with any rights the creditor may have under the contract or under state law with respect to set-off, cross collateralization, or similar provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Total balance due. The phrase total balance due refers to the total outstanding balance. Thus, this provision does not apply where the consumer has simply paid an amount in excess of the payment due for a given period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing of refund. The creditor may also fulfill its obligation under this section by:</p><p class="depth0">Refunding any credit balance to the consumer immediately.</p><p class="depth0">Refunding any credit balance prior to a written request from the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Making a good faith effort to refund any credit balance before 6 months have passed. If that attempt is unsuccessful, the creditor need not try again to refund the credit balance at the end of the 6-month period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(b).</p><p class="depth0">1. Written requests--standing orders. The creditor is not required to honor standing orders requesting refunds of any credit balance that may be created on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(c).</p><p class="depth0">1. Good faith effort to refund. The creditor must take positive steps to return any credit balance that has remained in the account for over 6 months. This includes, if necessary, attempts to trace the consumer through the consumer's last known address or telephone number, or both.</p><p class="depth0">2. Good faith effort unsuccessful. Section 226.21 imposes no further duties on the creditor if a good faith effort to return the balance is unsuccessful. The ultimate disposition of the credit balance (or any credit balance of $1 or less) is to be determined under other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 165.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: None.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: None.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: This section implements section 165 of the Act, which was expanded by the 1980 statutory amendments to apply to closed-end as well as open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.22--Determination of the Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">22(a) Accuracy of the annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation method. The regulation recognizes both the actuarial method and the United States Rule Method (U.S. Rule) as measures of an exact annual percentage rate. Both methods yield the same annual percentage rate when payment intervals are equal. They differ in their treatment of unpaid accrued interest.</p><p class="depth0">2. Actuarial method. When no payment is made, or when the payment is insufficient to

pay the accumulated finance charge, the actuarial method requires that the unpaid finance charge be added to the amount financed and thereby capitalized. Interest is computed on interest since in succeeding periods the interest rate is applied to the unpaid balance including the unpaid finance charge. Appendix J provides instructions and examples for calculating the annual percentage rate using the actuarial method.</p><p class="depth0">3. U.S. Rule. The U.S. Rule produces no compounding of interest in that any unpaid accrued interest is accumulated separately and is not added to principal. In addition, under the U.S. Rule, no interest calculation is made until a payment is received.</p><p class="depth0">4. Basis for calculations. When a transaction involves ``step rates'' or ``split rates''--that is, different rates applied at different times or to different portions of the principal balance--a single composite annual percentage rate must be calculated and disclosed for the entire transaction. Assume, for example, a step-rate transaction in which a $10,000 loan is repayable in 5 years at 10 percent interest for the first 2 years, 12 percent for years 3 and 4, and 14 percent for year 5. The monthly payments are $210.71 during the first 2 years of the term, $220.25 for years 3 and 4, and $222.59 for year 5. The composite annual percentage rate, using a calculator with a ``discounted cash flow analysis'' or ``internal rate of return'' function, is 10.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5. Good faith reliance on faulty calculation tools. Footnote 45d absolves a creditor of liability for an error in the annual percentage rate or finance charge that resulted from a corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good faith by the creditor. Whether or not the creditor's use of the tool was in good faith must be determined on a case-by-case basis, but the creditor must in any case have taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the tool, including any instructions, before using it. Generally, the footnote is available only for errors directly attributable to the calculation tool itself, including software programs; it is not intended to absolve a creditor of liability for its own errors, or for errors arising from improper use of the tool, from incorrect data entry, or from misapplication of the law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular transactions. The annual percentage rate for a regular transaction is considered accurate if it varies in either direction by not more than \1/8\ of 1 percentage point from the actual annual percentage rate. For example, when the exact annual percentage rate is determined to be 10\1/8\%, a disclosed annual percentage rate from 10% to 10\1/4\%, or the decimal equivalent, is deemed to comply with the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Irregular transactions. The annual percentage rate for an irregular transaction is considered accurate if it varies in either direction by not more than \1/4\ of 1 percentage point from the actual annual percentage rate. This tolerance is intended for more complex transactions that do not call for a single advance and a regular series of equal payments at equal intervals. The \1/4\ of 1 percentage point tolerance may be used, for example, in a construction loan where advances are made as construction progresses, or in a transaction where payments vary to reflect the consumer's seasonal income. It may also be used in transactions with graduated payment schedules where the contract commits the consumer to several series of payments in different amounts. It does not apply, however, to loans with variable rate features where the initial disclosures are based on a regular amortization schedule over the life of the loan, even though payments may later change because of the variable rate feature.</p><p class="depth0">22(a)(4) Mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. If a creditor improperly omits a $75 fee from the finance charge on a regular transaction, the understated finance charge is considered accurate under Sec. 226.18(d)(1), and the annual percentage rate corresponding to that understated finance charge also is considered accurate even if it falls outside the tolerance of \1/8\ of 1 percentage point provided under Sec. 226.22(a)(2). Because a $75 error was made, an annual percentage rate corresponding to a $100 understatement of the finance charge would not be considered accurate.</p><p class="depth0">22(a)(5) Additional tolerance for mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. This paragraph contains an additional tolerance for a disclosed annual percentage rate that is incorrect but is closer to the actual annual percentage rate than the rate that would be considered accurate under the tolerance in Sec. 226.22(a)(4). To illustrate: in an irregular transaction subject to a \1/4\ of 1 percentage point tolerance, if the actual annual percentage rate is 9.00 percent and a $75 omission from the finance charge corresponds to a rate of 8.50 percent that is considered accurate under Sec. 226.22(a)(4), a disclosed APR of 8.65 percent is within the tolerance in Sec. 226.22(a)(5). In this example of an understated finance charge, a disclosed annual percentage rate below 8.50 or above 9.25 percent will not be considered accurate.</p><p class="depth0">22(b) Computation tools.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Board tables. Volumes I and II of the Board's Annual Percentage Rate Tables provide a means of calculating annual percentage rates for regular and irregular transactions, respectively. An annual percentage rate computed in accordance with the instructions in the tables is deemed to comply with the regulation, even where use of the tables produces a rate that falls outside the general standard of accuracy. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">Volume I may be used for single advance transactions with completely regular payment schedules or with payment schedules that are regular except for an odd first payment, odd first period or odd final payment. When used for a transaction with a large final balloon payment, Volume I may produce a rate that is considerably higher than the exact rate produced using a computer program based directly on appendix J. However, the Volume I rate--produced using certain adjustments in that volume--is considered to be in compliance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Other calculation tools. Creditors need not use the Board tables in calculating the annual percentage rates. Any computation tools may be used, so long as they produce annual percentage rates within \1/8\ or \1/4\ of 1 percentage point, as applicable, of the precise actuarial or U.S. Rule annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">22(c) Single add-on rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Creditors applying a single add-on rate to all transactions up to 60 months in length may disclose the same annual percentage rate for all those transactions, although the actual annual percentage rate varies according to the length of the transaction. Creditors utilizing this provision must show the highest of those rates. For example:</p><p class="depth0">An add-on rate of 10 percent converted to an annual percentage rate produce the following actual annual percentage rates at various maturities: at 3 months, 14.94 percent; at 21 months, 18.18 percent; and at 60 months, 17.27 percent. The creditor must disclose an annual percentage rate of 18.18 percent (the highest annual percentage rate) for any transaction up to 5 years, even though that rate is precise only for a transaction of 21 months.</p><p class="depth0">22(d) Certain transactions involving ranges of balances.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Creditors applying a fixed dollar finance charge to all balances within a specified range of balances may understate the annual percentage rate by up to 8 percent of that rate, by disclosing for all those balances the annual percentage rate computed on the median balance within that range. For example:</p><p class="depth0">If a finance charge of $9 applies to all balances between $91 and $100, an annual percentage rate of 10 percent (the rate on the median balance) may be disclosed as the annual percentage rate for all balances, even though a $9 finance charge applied to the lowest balance ($91) would actually produce an annual percentage rate of 10.7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 107.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.17(c)(4) and appendix J.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.5(b) through (e).</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: The section now provides a larger tolerance (\1/4\ of 1 percentage point) for irregular transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.23--Right of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions not covered. Credit extensions that are not subject to the regulation are not covered by Sec. 226.23 even if a customer's principal dwelling is the collateral securing the credit. For example, the right of rescission does not apply to a business purpose loan, even though the loan is secured by the customer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">23(a) Consumer's right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Security interest arising from transaction. In order for the right of rescission to apply, the security interest must be retained as part of the credit transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A security interest that is acquired by a contractor who is also extending the credit in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">A mechanic's or materialman's lien that is retained by a subcontractor or supplier of the contractor-creditor, even when the latter has waived its own security interest in the consumer's home.</p><p class="depth0">The security interest is not part of the credit transaction and therefore the transaction is not subject to the right of rescission when, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A mechanic's or materialman's lien is obtained by a contractor who is not a party to the credit transaction but is merely paid with the proceeds of the consumer's unsecured bank loan.</p><p class="depth0">All security interests that may arise in connection with the credit transaction are validly waived.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor obtains a lien and completion bond that in effect satisfies all liens against the consumer's principal dwelling as a result of the credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Although liens arising by operation of law are not considered security interests for purposes of disclosure under Sec. 226.2, that section specifically includes them in the definition for purposes of the right of rescission. Thus, even though an interest in the consumer's principal dwelling is not a required disclosure under Sec. 226.18(m), it may still give rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consumer. To be a consumer within the meaning of Sec. 226.2, that person must at least have an ownership interest in the dwelling that is encumbered by the creditor's security interest, although that person need not be a signatory to the credit agreement. For example, if only one spouse signs a credit contract, the other spouse is a consumer if the ownership interest of that spouse is subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">3. Principal dwelling. A consumer can only have one principal dwelling at a time. (But

see comment 23(a)(1)-4.) A vacation or other second home would not be a principal dwelling. A transaction secured by a second home (such as a vacation home) that is not currently being used as the consumer's principal dwelling is not rescindable, even if the consumer intends to reside there in the future. When a consumer buys or builds a new dwelling that will become the consumer's principal dwelling within one year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal dwelling if it secures the acquisition or construction loan. In that case, the transaction secured by the new dwelling is a residential mortgage transaction and is not rescindable. For example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, a construction loan to finance B and secured by B is a residential mortgage transaction. Dwelling, as defined in Sec. 226.2, includes structures that are classified as personalty under state law. For example, a transaction secured by a mobile home, trailer, or houseboat used as the consumer's principal dwelling may be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">4. Special rule for principal dwelling. Notwithstanding the general rule that consumers may have only one principal dwelling, when the consumer is acquiring or constructing a new principal dwelling, any loan subject to Regulation Z and secured by the equity in the consumer's current principal dwelling (for example, a bridge loan) is subject to the right of rescission regardless of the purpose of that loan. For example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, a construction loan to finance B and secured by A is subject to the right of rescission. A loan secured by both A and B is, likewise, rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">5. Addition of a security interest. Under footnote 47, the addition of a security interest in a consumer's principal dwelling to an existing obligation is rescindable even if the existing obligation is not satisfied and replaced by a new obligation, and even if the existing obligation was previously exempt under Sec. 226.3(b). The right of rescission applies only to the added security interest, however, and not to the original obligation. In those situations, only the Sec. 226.23(b) notice need be delivered, not new material disclosures; the rescission period will begin to run from the delivery of the notice.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Consumer's exercise of right. The consumer must exercise the right of rescission in writing but not necessarily on the notice supplied under Sec. 226.23(b). Whatever the means of sending the notification of rescission--mail, telegram or other written means--the time period for the creditor's performance under Sec. 226.23(d)(2) does not begin to run until the notification has been received. The creditor may designate an agent to receive the notification so long as the agent's name and address appear on the notice provided to the consumer under Sec. 226.23(b). Where the creditor fails to provide the consumer with a designated address for sending the notification of rescission, delivering notification to the person or address to which the consumer has been directed to send, payments constitutes delivery to the creditor or assignee. State law determines whether delivery of the notification to a third party other than the person to whom payments are made is delivery to the creditor or assignee, in the case where the creditor fails to designate an address for sending the notification of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rescission period. The period within which the consumer may exercise the right to rescind runs for 3 business days from the last of 3 events:</p><p class="depth0">Consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery of all material disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery to the consumer of the required rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">For example, if a transaction is consummated on Friday, June 1, and the disclosures and notice of the right to rescind were given on Thursday, May 31, the rescission period will expire at midnight of the third business day after June 1--that is, Tuesday, June 5. In another example, if the disclosures are given and the transaction consummated on Friday, June 1, and the rescission notice is given on Monday, June 4, the rescission period expires at midnight of the third business day after June 4--that is, Thursday, June 7. The consumer must place the rescission notice in the mail, file it for telegraphic transmission, or deliver it to the creditor's place of business within that period in order to exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material disclosures. Footnote 48 sets forth the material disclosures that must be provided before the rescission period can begin to run. Failure to provide information regarding the annual pecentage rate also includes failure to inform the consumer of the existence of a variable rate feature. Failure to give the other required disclosures does not prevent the running of the rescission period, although that failure may result in civil liability or administrative sanctions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unexpired right of rescission. When the creditor has failed to take the action necessary to start the three-business day rescission period running, the right to rescind automatically lapses on the occurrence of the earliest of the following three events:</p><p class="depth0">The expiration of three years after consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer of all the consumer's interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">Sale of the consumer's interest in the property, including a transaction in which the consumer sells the dwelling and takes back a purchase money note and mortgage or retains legal title through a device such as an installment sale contract.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer of all the consumers' interest includes such transfers as bequests and gifts. A sale or transfer of the property need not be voluntary to terminate the right to rescind. For example, a foreclosure sale would terminate an unexpired right to rescind. As provided in section 125 of the Act, the three-year limit may be extended by an administrative proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section. A partial transfer of the consumer's interest, such as a transfer bestowing co-ownership on a spouse, does not terminate the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint owners. When more than one consumer has the right to rescind a transaction, any of them may exercise that right and cancel the transaction on behalf of all. For example, if both husband and wife have the right to rescind a transaction, either spouse acting alone may exercise the right and both are bound by the rescission.</p><p class="depth0">23(b) Notice of right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">1. Who receives notice. Each consumer entitled to rescind must be given:</p><p class="depth0">Two copies of the rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">The material disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">In a transaction involving joint owners, both of whom are entitled to rescind, both must receive the notice of the right to rescind and disclosures. For example, if both spouses are entitled to rescind a transaction, each must receive two copies of the rescission notice (one copy to each if the notice is provided in electronic form in accordance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act) and one copy of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. The notice must be on a separate piece of paper, but may appear with other information such as the itemization of the amount financed. The material must be clear and conspicuous, but no minimum type size or other technical requirements are imposed. The notices in appendix H provide models that creditors may use in giving the notice.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content. The notice must include all of the information outlined in Section 226.23(b)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement in Sec. 226.23(b) that the transaction be identified may be met by providing the date of the transaction. The creditor may provide a separate form that the consumer may use to exercise the right of rescission, or that form may be combined with the other rescission disclosures, as illustrated in appendix H. The notice may include additional information related to the required information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A description of the property subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">A statement that joint owners may have the right to rescind and that a rescission by one is effective for all.</p><p class="depth0">The name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive notice of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Time of providing notice. The notice required by Sec. 226.23(b) need not be given before consummation of the transaction. The creditor may deliver the notice after the transaction is consummated, but the rescission period will not begin to run until the notice is given. For example, if the creditor provides the notice on May 15, but disclosures were given and the transaction was consummated on May 10, the 3-business day rescission period will run from May 15.</p><p class="depth0">23(c) Delay of creditor's performance.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Until the rescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded, the creditor must not, either directly or through a third party:</p><p class="depth0">Disburse loan proceeds to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Begin performing services for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Deliver materials to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Escrow. The creditor may disburse loan proceeds during the rescission period in a valid escrow arrangement. The creditor may not, however, appoint the consumer as ``trustee'' or ``escrow agent'' and distribute funds to the consumer in that capacity during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Actions during the delay period. Section 226.23(c) does not prevent the creditor from taking other steps during the delay, short of beginning actual performance. Unless otherwise prohibited, such as by state law, the creditor may, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Prepare the loan check.</p><p class="depth0">Perfect the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">Prepare to discount or assign the contract to a third party.</p><p class="depth0">Accrue finance charges during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Delay beyond rescission period. The creditor must wait until it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself by doing one of the following:</p><p class="depth0">Waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the rescission period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice.</p><p class="depth0">Obtaining a written statement from the consumer that the right has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">When more than one consumer has the right to rescind, the creditor cannot reasonably rely on the assurance of only one consumer, because other consumers may exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">23(d) Effects of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination of security interest. Any security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void when the consumer exercises the right of rescission. The security interest is automatically negated regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected. Under Sec. 226.23(d)(2), however, the creditor must take any action necessary to reflect the fact that the security interest no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Refunds to consumer. The consumer cannot be required to pay any amount in the form of money or property either to the creditor or to a third party as part of the credit transaction. Any amounts of this nature already paid by the consumer must be refunded. ``Any amount'' includes finance charges already accrued, as well as other charges, such as broker fees, application and commitment fees, or fees for a title search or appraisal, whether paid to the creditor, paid directly to a third party, or passed on from the creditor to the third party. It is irrelevant that these amounts may not represent profit to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts not refundable to consumer. Creditors need not return any money given by the consumer to a third party outside of the credit transaction, such as costs incurred for a building permit or for a zoning variance. Similarly, the term any amount does not apply to any money or property given by the creditor to the consumer; those amounts must be tendered by the consumer to the creditor under Sec. 226.23(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reflection of security interest termination. The creditor must take whatever steps are necessary to indicate that the security interest is terminated. Those steps include the cancellation of documents creating the security interest, and the filing of release or termination statements in the public record. In a transaction involving subcontractors or suppliers that also hold security interests related to the credit transaction, the creditor must insure that the termination of their security interests is also reflected. The 20-day period for the creditor's action refers to the time within which the creditor must begin the process. It does not require all necessary steps to have been completed within that time, but the creditor is responsible for seeing the process through to completion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Property exchange. Once the creditor has fulfilled its obligations under Sec. 226.23(d)(2), the consumer must tender to the creditor any property or money the creditor has already delivered to the consumer. At the consumer's option, property may be tendered at the location of the property. For example, if lumber or fixtures have been delivered to the consumer's home, the consumer may tender them to the creditor by making them available for pick-up at the home, rather than physically returning them to the creditor's premises. Money already given to the consumer must be tendered at the creditor's place of business.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable value. If returning the property would be extremely burdensome to the consumer, the consumer may offer the creditor its reasonable value rather than returning the property itself. For example, if building materials have already been incorporated into the consumer's dwelling, the consumer may pay their reasonable value.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Modifications. The procedures outlined in Sec. 226.23(d)(2) and (3) may be modified by a court. For example, when a consumer is in bankruptcy proceedings and prohibited from returning anything to the creditor, or when the equities dictate, a modification might be made. The sequence of procedures under Sec. 226.23(d)(2) and (3), or a court's modification of those procedures under Sec. 226.23(d)(4), does not affect a consumer's substantive right to rescind and to have the loan amount adjusted accordingly. Where the consumer's right to rescind is contested by the creditor, a court would normally determine whether the consumer has a right to rescind and determine the amounts owed before establishing the procedures for the parties to tender any money or property.</p><p class="depth0">23(e) Consumer's waiver of right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">1. Need for waiver. To waive the right to rescind, the consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that must be met before the end of the rescission period. The existence of the consumer's waiver will not, of itself, automatically insulate the creditor from liability for failing to provide the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure. To waive or modify the right to rescind, the consumer must give a written statement that specifically waives or modifies the right, and also includes a brief description of the emergency. Each consumer entitled to rescind must sign the waiver statement. In a transaction involving multiple consumers, such as a husband and wife using their home as collateral, the waiver must bear the signatures of both spouses.</p><p class="depth0">23(f) Exempt transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Residential mortgage transaction. Any transaction to construct or acquire a principal dwelling, whether considered real or personal property, is exempt. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.23(a).) For example, a credit transaction to acquire a mobile home or houseboat to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling would not be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lien status. The lien status of the mortgage is irrelevant for purposes of the exemption in Sec. 226.23(f)(1); the fact that a loan has junior lien status does not by itself preclude application of this exemption. For example, a home buyer may assume the existing first mortgage and create a second mortgage to finance the balance of the purchase price. Such a transaction would not be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Combined-purpose transaction. A loan to acquire a principal dwelling and make improvements to that dwelling is exempt if treated as one transaction. If, on the other hand, the loan for the acquisition of the principal dwelling and the subsequent advances for improvements are treated as more than one transaction, then only the transaction that finances the acquisition of that dwelling is exempt.</p><p class="depth0">4. New advances. The exemption in Sec. 226.23(f)(2) applies only to refinancings (including consolidations) by the original creditor. The original creditor is the creditor to whom the written agreement was initially made payable. In a merger, consolidation or acquisition, the successor institution is considered the original creditor for purposes of the exemption in Sec. 226.23(f)(2). If the refinancing involves a new advance of money, the amount of the new advance is rescindable. In determining whether there is a new advance, a creditor may rely on the amount financed, refinancing costs, and other figures stated in the latest Truth in Lending disclosures provided to the consumer and is not required to use, for example, more precise information that may only become available when the loan is closed. For purposes of the right of rescission, a new advance does not include amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. These amounts would include Sec. 226.4(c)(7) charges (such as attorneys fees and title examination and insurance fees, if bona fide and reasonable in amount), as well as insurance premiums and other charges that are not finance charges. (Finance charges on the new transaction--points, for example--would not be considered in determining whether there is a new advance of money in a refinancing since finance charges are not part of the amount financed.) To illustrate, if the sum of the outstanding principal balance plus the earned unpaid finance charge is $50,000 and the new amount financed is $51,000, then the refinancing would be exempt if the extra $1,000 is attributed solely to costs financed in connection with the refinancing that are not finance charges. Of course, if new advances of money are made (for example, to pay for home improvements) and the consumer exercises the right of rescission, the consumer must be placed in the same position as he or she was in prior to entering into the new credit transaction. Thus, all amounts of money (which would include all the costs of the refinancing) already paid by the consumer to the creditor or to a third party as part of the refinancing would have to be refunded to the consumer. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.23(d)(2) for a discussion of refunds to consumers.) A model rescission notice applicable to transactions involving new advances appears in appendix H. The general rescission notice (model form H-8) is the appropriate form for use by creditors not considered original creditors in refinancing transactions.</p><p class="depth0">5. State creditors. Cities and other political subdivisions of states acting as creditors are not exempted from this section.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple advances. Just as new disclosures need not be made for subsequent advances when treated as one transaction, no new rescission rights arise so long as the appropriate notice and disclosures are given at the outset of the transaction. For example, the creditor extends credit for home improvements secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, with advances made as repairs progress. As permitted by Sec. 226.17(c)(6), the creditor makes a single set of disclosures at the beginning of the construction period, rather than separate disclosures for each advance. The right of rescission does not arise with each advance. However, if the advances are treated as separate transactions, the right of rescission applies to each advance.</p><p class="depth0">7. Spreader clauses. When the creditor holds a mortgage or deed of trust on the consumer's principal dwelling and that mortgage or deed of trust contains a ``spreader clause,'' subsequent loans made are separate transactions and are subject to the right of rescission. Those loans are rescindable unless the creditor effectively waives its security interest under the spreader clause with respect to the subsequent transactions.</p><p class="depth0">8. Converting open-end to closed-end credit. Under certain state laws, consummation of a closed-end credit transaction may occur at the time a consumer enters into the intitial open-end credit agreement. As provided in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(b), closed-end credit disclosures may be delayed under these circumstances until the conversion of the open-end account to a closed-end transaction. In accounts secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, no new right of rescission arises at the time of conversion. Rescission rights under Sec. 226.15 are unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">23(g) Tolerances for accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">23(g)(2) One percent tolerance.</p><p class="depth0">1. New advance. The phrase ``new advance'' has the same meaning as in comment 23(f)-4.</p><p class="depth0">23(h) Special Rules for Foreclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rescission. Section 226.23(h) applies only to transactions that are subject to rescission under Sec. 226.23(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(h)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage broker fees. A consumer may rescind a loan in foreclosure if a mortgage broker fee that should have been included in the finance charge was omitted, without regard to the dollar amount involved. If the amount of the mortgage broker fee is included but misstated the rule in Sec. 226.23(h)(2) applies.</p><p class="depth0">23(h)(2) Tolerance for disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This section is based on the accuracy of the total finance charge rather than its component charges.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 113, 125, and 130.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.2 and appendix H.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.9.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: The right to rescind applies not only to real property used as the consumer's principal dwelling, but to personal property as well. The regulation provides no specific text or format for the notice of the right to rescind.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.24--Advertising</p><p class="depth0">1. Effective date. For guidance on the applicability of the Board's changes to Sec. 226.24 published on July 30, 2008, see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">24(a) Actually available terms.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. To the extent that an advertisement mentions specific credit terms, it may state only those terms that the creditor is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not advertise a very low annual percentage rate that will not in fact be available at any time. This provision is not intended to inhibit the promotion of new credit programs, but to bar the advertising of terms that are not and will not be available. For example, a creditor may advertise terms that will be offered for only a limited period, or terms that will become available at a future date.</p><p class="depth0">24(b) Clear and conspicuous standard.</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard--general. This section is subject to the general ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for this subpart, see Sec. 226.17(a)(1), but prescribes no specific rules for the format of the necessary disclosures, other than the format requirements related to the advertisement of rates and payments as described in comment 24(b)-2 below. The credit terms need not be printed in a certain type size nor need they appear in any particular place in the advertisement. For example, a merchandise tag that is an advertisement under the regulation complies with this section if the necessary credit terms are on both sides of the tag, so long as each side is accessible.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard--rates and payments in advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of Sec. 226.24(f), a clear and conspicuous disclosure means that the required information in Sec. Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) and 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) is disclosed with equal prominence and in close proximity to the advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures, and that the required information in Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(C) is disclosed prominently and in close proximity to the advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures. If the required information in Sec. Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) and 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) is the same type size as the advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures, the disclosures are deemed to be equally prominent. The information in Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(C) must be disclosed prominently, but need not be disclosed with equal prominence or be the same type size as the payments triggering the required disclosures. If the required information in Sec. Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) and 226.24(f)(3)(i) is located immediately next to or directly above or below the advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures are deemed to be in close proximity. Notwithstanding the above, for electronic advertisements that disclose rates or payments, compliance with the requirements of Sec. 226.24(e) is deemed to satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard--Internet advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, a clear and conspicuous disclosure for visual text advertisements on the Internet for credit secured by a dwelling means that the required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other devices and comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures under Sec. 226.24. See also comment 24(e)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Clear and conspicuous standard--televised advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, including alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 226.24(g), a clear and conspicuous disclosure in the context of visual text advertisements on television for credit secured by a dwelling means that the required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other devices, are displayed in a manner that allows a consumer to read the information required to be disclosed, and comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures under Sec. 226.24. For example, very fine print in a television advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clear and conspicuous standard--oral advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, including alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 226.24(g), a clear and conspicuous disclosure in the context of an oral advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, whether by radio, television, or other medium, means that the required disclosures are given at a speed and volume sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them. For example, information stated very rapidly at a low volume in a radio or television advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot hear and comprehend the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">24(c) Advertisment of rate of finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Annual percentage rate. Advertised rates must be stated in terms of an annual percentage rate, as defined in Sec. 226.22. Even though state or local law permits the use of add-on, discount, time-price differential, or other methods of stating rates, advertisements must state them as annual percentage rates. Unlike the transactional disclosure of an annual percentage rate under Sec. 226.18(e), the advertised annual percentage rate need not include a descriptive explanation of the term and may be expressed using the abbreviation APR. The advertisement must state that the rate is subject to increase after consummation if that is the case, but the advertisement need not describe the rate increase, its limits, or how it would affect the payment schedule. As under Sec. 226.18(f), relating to disclosure of a variable rate, the rate increase disclosure requirement in this provision does not apply to any rate increase due to delinquency (including late payment), default, acceleration, assumption, or transfer of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simple or periodic rates. The advertisement may not simultaneously state any other rate, except that a simple annual rate or periodic rate applicable to an unpaid balance may appear along with (but not more conspicuously than) the annual percentage rate. An advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling may not state a periodic rate, other than a simple annual rate, that is applied to an unpaid balance. For example, in an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, a simple annual interest rate may be shown in the same type size as the annual percentage rate for the advertised credit, subject to the requirements of section 226.24(f). A simple annual rate or periodic rate that is applied to an unpaid balance is the rate at which interest is accruing; those terms do not include a rate lower than the rate at which interest is accruing, such as an effective rate, payment rate, or qualifying rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Buydowns. When a third party (such as a seller) or a creditor wishes to promote the availability of reduced interest rates (consumer or seller buydowns), the advertised annual percentage rate must be determined in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c) regarding the basis of transactional disclosures for buydowns. The seller or creditor may advertise the reduced simple interest rate, provided the advertisement shows the limited term to which the reduced rate applies and states the simple interest rate applicable to the balance of the term. The advertisement may also show the effect of the buydown agreement on the payment schedule for the buydown period, but this will trigger the additional disclosures under Sec. 226.24(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">4. Discounted variable-rate transactions. The advertised annual percentage rate for discounted variable-rate transactions must be determined in accordance with comment 17(c)(1)-10 regarding the basis of transactional disclosures for such financing.</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor or seller may promote the availability of the initial rate reduction in such transactions by advertising the reduced simple annual rate, provided the advertisement shows with equal prominence and in close proximity the limited term to which the reduced rate applies and the annual percentage rate that will apply after the term of the initial rate reduction expires. See Sec. 226.24(f).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Limits or caps on periodic rate or payment adjustments need not be stated. To illustrate using the second example in comment 17(c)(1)-10, the fact that the rate is presumed to be 11 percent in the second year and 12 percent for the remaining 28 years need not be included in the advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The advertisement may also show the effect of the discount on the payment schedule for the discount period, but this will trigger the additional disclosures under Sec. 226.24(d).</p><p class="depth0">24(d) Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Under Sec. 226.24(d)(1), whenever certain triggering terms appear in credit advertisements, the additional credit terms enumerated in Sec. 226.24(d)(2) must also appear. These provisions apply even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly but may be readily determined from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement may state ``80 percent financing available,'' which is in fact indicating that a 20 percent downpayment is required.</p><p class="depth0">24(d) Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Under Sec. 226.24(c)(1), whenever certain triggering terms appear in credit advertisements, the additional credit terms enumerated in Sec. 226.24(c)(2) must also appear. These provisions apply even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly, but may be readily determined from the advertisement. For example, an advertisement may state ``80% financing available,'' which is in fact indicating that a 20% downpayment is required.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 24(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Downpayment. The dollar amount of a downpayment or a statement of the downpayment as a percentage of the price requires further information. By virtue of the definition of downpayment in Sec. 226.2, this triggering term is limited to credit sale transactions. It includes such statements as:</p><p class="depth0">Only 5% down.</p><p class="depth0">As low as $100 down.</p><p class="depth0">Total move-in costs of $800.</p><p class="depth0">This provision applies only if a downpayment is actually required; statements such as no downpayment or no trade-in required do not trigger the additional disclosures under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment period. The number of payments required or the total period of repayment includes such statements as:</p><p class="depth0">48-month payment terms.</p><p class="depth0">30-year mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Repayment in as many as 36 monthly installments.</p><p class="depth0">But it does not include such statements as ``pay weekly,'' ``monthly payment terms arranged,'' or ``take years to repay,'' since these statements do not indicate a time period over which a loan may be financed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment amount. The dollar amount of any payment includes statements such as:</p><p class="depth0">``Payable in installments of $103''.</p><p class="depth0">``$25 weekly''.</p><p class="depth0">``$500,000 loan for just $1,650 per month''.</p><p class="depth0">``$1,200 balance payable in 10 equal installments''.
In the last example, the amount of each payment is readily determinable, even though not explicitly stated. But statements such as ``monthly payments to suit your needs'' or ``regular monthly payments'' are not deemed to be statements of the amount of any payment.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charge. The dollar amount of the finance charge or any portion of it includes statements such as:</p><p class="depth0">``$500 total cost of credit.''</p><p class="depth0">``$2 monthly carrying charge.''</p><p class="depth0">``$50,000 mortgages, 2 points to the borrower.''</p><p class="depth0">In the last example, the $1,000 prepaid finance charge can be readily determined from the information given. Statements of the annual percentage rate or statements that there is no particular charge for credit (such as ``no closing costs'') are not triggering terms under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 24(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of downpayment. The total downpayment as a dollar amount or percentage must be shown, but the word ``downpayment'' need not be used in making this disclosure. For example, ``10% cash required from buyer'' or ``credit terms require minimum $100 trade-in'' would suffice.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of repayment terms. The phrase ``terms of repayment'' generally has the same meaning as the ``payment schedule'' required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18(g). Section 226.24(d)(2)(ii) provides flexibility to creditors in making this disclosure for advertising purposes. Repayment terms may be expressed in a variety of ways in addition to an exact repayment schedule; this is particularly true for advertisements that do not contemplate a single specific transaction. Repayment terms, however, must reflect the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any balloon payment, see comment 24(d)(2)-3, not just the repayment terms that will apply for a limited period of time. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor may use a unit-cost approach in making the required disclosure, such as ``48 monthly payments of $27.83 per $1,000 borrowed.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. In an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, when any series of payments varies because of the inclusion of mortgage insurance premiums, a creditor may state the number and timing of payments, the fact that payments do not include amounts for mortgage insurance premiums, and that the actual payment obligation will be higher.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, when one series of monthly payments will apply for a limited period of time followed by a series of higher monthly payments for the remaining term of the loan, the advertisement must state the number and time period of each series of payments, and the amounts of each of those payments. For this purpose, the creditor must assume that the consumer makes the lower series of payments for the maximum allowable period of time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Balloon payment; disclosure of repayment terms. In some transactions, a balloon payment will occur when the consumer only makes the minimum payments specified in an advertisement. A balloon payment results if paying the minimum payments does not fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, usually the end of the term of the loan, and the consumer must repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. If a balloon payment will occur when the consumer only makes the minimum payments specified in an advertisement, the advertisement must state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum payment statement the amount and timing of the balloon payment that will result if the consumer makes only the minimum payments for the maximum period of time that the consumer is permitted to make such payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Annual percentage rate. The advertised annual percentage rate may be expressed using the abbreviation ``APR.'' The advertisement must also state, if applicable, that the annual percentage rate is subject to increase after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Use of examples. A creditor may use illustrative credit transactions to make the necessary disclosures under Sec. 226.24(d)(2). That is, where a range of possible combinations of credit terms is offered, the advertisement may use examples of typical transactions, so long as each example contains all of the applicable terms required by Sec. 226.24(d). The examples must be labeled as such and must reflect representative credit terms made available by the creditor to present and prospective customers.</p><p class="depth0">24(e) Catalogs or Other Multiple-page Advertisements; Electronic Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The multiple-page advertisements to which this section refers are advertisements consisting of a series of sequentially numbered pages--for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing consisting of several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single envelope does not constitute a single multiple-page advertisement for purposes of Sec. 226.24(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. General. Section 226.24(e) permits creditors to put credit information together in one place in a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or in an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site). The rule applies only if the advertisement contains one or more of the triggering terms from Sec. 226.24(d)(1). A list of different annual percentage rates applicable to different balances, for example, does not trigger further disclosures under Sec. 226.24(d)(2) and so is not covered by Sec. 226.24(e).</p><p class="depth0">3. Representative examples. The table or schedule must state all the necessary information for a representative sampling of amounts of credit. This must reflect amounts of credit the creditor actually offers, up to and including the higher-priced items. This does not mean that the chart must make the disclosures for the single most expensive item the seller offers, but only that the chart cannot be limited to information about less expensive sales when the seller commonly offers a distinct level of more expensive goods or services. The range of transactions shown in the table or schedule in a particular catalog or multiple-page advertisement need not exceed the range of transactions actually offered in that advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Electronic advertisement. If an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) contains the table or schedule permitted under Sec. 226.24(e)(1), any statement of terms set forth in Sec. 226.24(d)(1) appearing anywhere else in the advertisement must clearly direct the consumer to the location where the table or schedule begins. For example, a term triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly takes the consumer to the additional information.</p><p class="depth0">24(f) Disclosure of rates and payments in advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The requirements of Sec. 226.24(f)(2) apply to advertisements for loans where more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply. The requirements of Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A) require a clear and conspicuous disclosure of each payment that will apply over the term of the loan. In determining whether a payment will apply when the consumer may choose to make a series of lower monthly payments that will apply for a limited period of time, the creditor must assume that the consumer makes the series of lower payments for the maximum allowable period of time. See comment 24(d)(2)-2.iii. However, for purposes of Sec. 226.24(f), the creditor may, but need not, assume that specific events which trigger changes to the simple annual rate of interest or to the applicable payments will occur. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fixed-rate conversion loans. If a loan program permits consumers to convert their variable-rate loans to fixed rate loans, the creditor need not assume that the fixed-rate conversion option, by itself, means that more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply to the loan under Sec. 226.24(f)(2) and need not disclose as a separate payment under Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A) the payment that would apply if the consumer exercised the fixed-rate conversion option.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Preferred-rate loans. Some loans contain a preferred-rate provision, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as the consumer-employee leaving the creditor's employ or the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor or the consumer revoking an election to make automated payments. A creditor need not assume that the preferred-rate provision, by itself, means that more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply to the loan under Sec. 226.24(f)(2) and the payments that would apply upon occurrence of the event that triggers the rate increase need not be disclosed as a separate payments under Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Rate reductions. Some loans contain a provision where the rate will decrease upon the occurrence of some event, such as if the consumer makes a series of payments on time. A creditor need not assume that the rate reduction provision, by itself, means that more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply to the loan under Sec. 226.24(f)(2) and need not disclose the payments that would apply upon occurrence of the event that triggers the rate reduction as a separate payments under Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Equal prominence, close proximity. Information required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) and 226.24(f)(3)(i) that is immediately next to or directly above or below the simple annual rate or payment amount (but not in a footnote) is deemed to be closely proximate to the listing. Information required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) and 226.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) that is in the same type size as the simple annual rate or payment amount is deemed to be equally prominent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard. For more information about the applicable clear and conspicuous standard, see comment 24(b)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. Comparisons in advertisements. When making any comparison in an advertisement between actual or hypothetical credit payments or rates and the payments or rates available under the advertised product, the

advertisement must state all applicable payments or rates for the advertised product and the time periods for which those payments or rates will apply, as required by this section.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application to variable-rate transactions--disclosure of rates. In advertisements for variable-rate transactions, if a simple annual rate that applies at consummation is not based on the index and margin that will be used to make subsequent rate adjustments over the term of the loan, the requirements of Sec. 226.24(f)(2)(i) apply.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonably current index and margin. For the purposes of this section, an index and margin is considered reasonably current if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For direct mail advertisements, it was in effect within 60 days before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For advertisements in electronic form it was in effect within 30 days before the advertisement is sent to a consumer's e-mail address, or in the case of an advertisement made on an Internet Web site, when viewed by the public; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. For printed advertisements made available to the general public, including ones contained in a catalog, magazine, or other generally available publication, it was in effect within 30 days before printing.</p><p class="depth0">24(f)(3) Disclosure of payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts and time periods of payments. Section 226.24(f)(3)(i) requires disclosure of the amounts and time periods of all payments that will apply over the term of the loan. This section may require disclosure of several payment amounts, including any balloon payment. For example, if an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling offers $300,000 of credit with a 30-year loan term for a payment of $600 per month for the first six months, increasing to $1,500 per month after month six, followed by a balloon payment of $30,000 at the end of the loan term, the advertisement must disclose the amount and time periods of each of the two monthly payment streams, as well as the amount and timing of the balloon payment, with equal prominence and in close proximity to each other. However, if the final scheduled payment of a fully amortizing loan is not greater than two times the amount of any other regularly scheduled payment, the final payment need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application to variable-rate transactions--disclosure of payments. In advertisements for variable-rate transactions, if the payment that applies at consummation is not based on the index and margin that will be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the term of the loan, the requirements of Sec. 226.24(f)(3)(i) apply.</p><p class="depth0">24(g) Alternative disclosures--television or radio advertisements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multi-purpose telephone number. When an advertised telephone number provides a recording, disclosures should be provided early in the sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures. For example, in providing several options--such as providing directions to the advertiser's place of business--the option allowing the consumer to request disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by other information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement accompanying telephone number. Language must accompany a telephone number indicating that disclosures are available by calling the telephone number, such as ``call 1-800-000-0000 for details about credit costs and terms.''</p><p class="depth0">24(i) Prohibited acts or practices in advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Comparisons in advertisements. The requirements of Sec. 226.24(i)(2) apply to all advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling, including radio and television advertisements. A comparison includes a claim about the amount a consumer may save under the advertised product. For example, a statement such as ``save $300 per month on a $300,000 loan'' constitutes an implied comparison between the advertised product's payment and a consumer's current payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Misrepresentations about government endorsement. A statement that the federal Community Reinvestment Act entitles the consumer to refinance his or her mortgage at the low rate offered in the advertisement is prohibited because it conveys a misleading impression that the advertised product is endorsed or sponsored by the federal government.</p><p class="depth0">3. Misleading claims of debt elimination. The prohibition against misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or forgiveness does not apply to legitimate statements that the advertised product may reduce debt payments, consolidate debts, or shorten the term of the debt. Examples of misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or forgiveness of loan terms with, or obligations to, another creditor of debt include: ``Wipe-Out Personal Debts!'', ``New DEBT-FREE Payment'', ``Set yourself free; get out of debt today'', ``Refinance today and wipe your debt clean!'', ``Get yourself out of debt * * * Forever!'', and ``Pre-payment Penalty Waiver.''</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 141, 142, and 144.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.2, 226.4, and 226.22.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.10 (a), (b), and (d).</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: This section retains the advertising rules in a form very similar to the previous regulation, but with certain changes to reflect the 1980 statutory amendments. For example, if triggering terms appear in any advertisement, the additional disclosures required no longer include the cash price. The special rule for FHA section 235 financing has been eliminated, as well as

the rule for advertising credit payable in more than four installments with no identified finance charge. Interpretation Sec. 226.1002, requiring disclosure of representative amounts of credit in catalogs and multiple-page advertisements, has been incorporated in simplified form in Sec. 226.24(d).</p><p class="depth0">Unlike the previous regulation, if the advertised annual percentage rate is subject to increase, that fact must now be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D--Miscellaneous</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.25--Record Retention</p><p class="depth0">25(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Evidence of required actions. The creditor must retain evidence that it performed the required actions as well as made the required disclosures. This includes, for example, evidence that the creditor properly handled adverse credit reports in connection with amounts subject to a billing dispute under Sec. 226.13, and properly handled the refunding of credit balances under Sec. Sec. 226.11 and 226.21.</p><p class="depth0">2. Methods of retaining evidence. Adequate evidence of compliance does not necessarily mean actual paper copies of disclosure statements or other business records. The evidence may be retained on microfilm, microfiche, or by any other method that reproduces records accurately (including computer programs). The creditor need retain only enough information to reconstruct the required disclosures or other records. Thus, for example, the creditor need not retain each open-end periodic statement, so long as the specific information on each statement can be retrieved.</p><p class="depth0">3. Certain variable-rate transactions. In variable-rate transactions that are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 226.19(b), written procedures for compliance with those requirements as well as a sample disclosure form for each loan program represent adequate evidence of compliance. (See comment 25(a)-2 pertaining to permissible methods of retaining the required disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Home equity plans. In home equity plans that are subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, written procedures for compliance with those requirements as well as a sample disclosure form and contract for each home equity program represent adequate evidence of compliance. (See comment 25(a)-2 pertaining to permissible methods of retaining the required disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Prohibited payments to loan originators. For each transaction subject to the loan originator compensation provisions in Sec. 226.36(d)(1), a creditor should maintain records of the compensation it provided to the loan originator for the transaction as well as the compensation agreement in effect on the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. See Sec. 226.35(a) and comment 35(a)(2)(iii)-3 for additional guidance on when a transaction's rate is set. For example, where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of compensation or other broker agreement required by applicable state law that complies with Sec. 226.25 would be presumed to be a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 105 and 108.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Appendix I.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.6(i).</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: Section 226.25 substitutes a uniform 2-year record-retention rule for the previous requirement that certain creditors retain records through at least one compliance examination. It also states more explicitly that the record-retention requirements apply to evidence of required actions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.26--Use of Annual Percentage Rate in Oral Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Application of rules. The restrictions of Sec. 226.26 apply only if the creditor chooses to respond orally to the consumer's request for credit cost information. Nothing in the regulation requires the creditor to supply rate information orally. If the creditor volunteers information (including rate information) through oral solicitations directed generally to prospective customers, as through a telephone solicitation, those communications may be advertisements subject to the rules in Sec. Sec. 226.16 and 226.24.</p><p class="depth0">26(a) Open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Information that may be given. The creditor may state periodic rates in addition to the required annual percentage rate, but it need not do so. If the annual percentage rate is unknown because transaction charges, loan fees, or similar finance charges may be imposed, the creditor must give the corresponding annual percentage rate (that is, the periodic rate multiplied by the number of periods in a year, as described in Sec. Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) and (b)(4)(i)(A) and 226.7(a)(4) and (b)(4)). In such cases, the creditor may, but need not, also give the consumer information about other finance charges and other charges.</p><p class="depth0">26(b) Closed-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Information that may be given. The creditor may state other annual or periodic rates that are applied to an unpaid balance, along with the required annual percentage rate. This rule permits disclosure of a simple interest rate, for example, but not an add-on, discount, or similar rate. If the creditor cannot give a precise annual percentage rate in its oral response because of variables in the transaction, it must give the annual percentage rate for a comparable sample transaction; in this case, other cost information may, but need not, be given. For example, the creditor may be unable to state a precise annual percentage rate for a mortgage loan

without knowing the exact amount to be financed, the amount of loan fees or mortgage insurance premiums, or similar factors. In this situation, the creditor should state an annual percentage rate for a sample transaction; it may also provide information about the consumer's specific case, such as the contract interest rate, points, other finance charges, and other charges.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 146.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.6(a)(2) and 226.7(d).</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Interpretation Sec. 226.101.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: This section implements amended section 146 of the Act, which added a provision dealing with oral disclosures, and incorporates Interpretation Sec. 226.101.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.27--Language of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Subsequent disclosures. If a creditor provides account-opening disclosures in a language other than English, subsequent disclosures need not be in that other language. For example, if the creditor gave Spanish-language account-opening disclosures, periodic statements and change-in-terms notices may be made in English.</p><p class="depth0">2.

General. There are 3 sets of preemption criteria: 1 applies to the general disclosure and advertising rules of the regulation, and 2 apply to the credit billing provisions. Section 226.28 also provides for Board determinations of preemption.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rules for chapters 1, 2, and 3. The standard for judging whether State laws that cover the types of requirements in chapters 1 (General provisions), 2 (Credit transactions), and 3 (Credit advertising) of the Act are inconsistent and therefore preempted, is contradiction of the Federal law. Examples of laws that would be preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">A State law that requires use of the term finance charge, but defines the term to include fees that the Federal law excludes, or to exclude fees the Federal law includes.</p><p class="depth0">A State law that requires a label such as nominal annual interest rate to be used for what the Federal law calls the annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Laws not contradictory to chapters 1, 2, and 3. Generally, State law requirements that call for the disclosure of items of information not covered by the Federal law, or that require more detailed disclosures, do not contradict the Federal requirements. Examples of laws that are not preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">A State law that requires disclosure of the minimum periodic payment for open-end credit, even though not required by Sec. 226.7.</p><p class="depth0">A State law that requires contracts to contain warnings such as: ``Read this contract before you sign. Do not sign if any spaces are left blank. You are entitled to a copy of this contract.''</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, a State law that requires itemization of the amount financed does not automatically contradict the permissive itemization under Sec. 226.18(c). However, a State law requirement that the itemization appear with the disclosure of the amount financed in the segregated closed-end credit disclosures is inconsistent, and this location requirement would be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor's options. Before the Board makes a determination about a specific State law, the creditor has certain options. Since the prohibition against giving the State disclosures does not apply until the Board makes its determination, the creditor may choose to give State disclosures until the Board formally determines that the State law is inconsistent. (The Board will provide sufficient time for creditors to revise forms and procedures as necessary to conform to its determinations.)</p><p class="depth0">Under this first approach, as in all cases, the Federal disclosures must be clear and conspicuous, and the closed-end disclosures must be properly segregated in accordance with Sec. 226.17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">This ability to give State disclosures relieves any uncertainty that the creditor might have prior to Board determinations of inconsistency.</p><p class="depth0">As a second option, the creditor may apply the preemption standards to a State law, conclude that it is inconsistent, and choose not to give the state-required disclosures. However, nothing in Sec. 226.28(a) provides the creditor with immunity for violations of State law if the creditor chooses not to make State disclosures and the Board later determines that the State law is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rules for correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports. The preemption criteria for the fair credit billing provisions set forth in Sec. 226.28 have 2 parts. With respect to the rules on correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports (which are in Sec. 226.13), Sec. 226.28(a)(2)(i) provides that a State law is inconsistent and preempted if its requirements are different from the Federal law. An exception is made, however, for State laws that allow the consumer to inquire about an account and require the creditor to respond to such inquiries beyond the time limits in the Federal law. Such a State law is not preempted with respect to the

extra time period. For example, Sec. 226.13 requires the consumer to submit a written notice of billing error within 60 days after transmittal of the periodic statement showing the alleged error. If a State law allows the consumer 90 days to submit a notice, the State law remains in effect to provide the extra 30 days. Any State law disclosures concerning this extended state time limit must reflect the qualifications and conform to the format specified in Sec. 226.28(a)(2)(i). Examples of laws that would be preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">A State law that has a narrower or broader definition of billing error.</p><p class="depth0">A State law that requires the creditor to take different steps to resolve errors.</p><p class="depth0">A State law that provides different timing rules for error resolution (subject to the exception discussed above).</p><p class="depth0">6. Rules for other fair credit billing provisions. The second part of the criteria for fair credit billing relates to the other rules implementing chapter 4 of the act (addressed in Sec. Sec. 226.4(c)(8), 226.5(b)(2)(ii), 226.6(a)(5) and (b)(5)(iii), 226.7(a)(9) and (b)(9), 226.9(a), 226.10, 226.11, 226.12(c) through (f), 226.13, and 226.21). Section 226.28(a)(2)(ii) provides that the test of inconsistency is whether the creditor can comply with state law without violating Federal law. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A state law that allows the card issuer to offset the consumer's credit-card indebtedness against funds held by the card issuer would be preempted, since Sec. 226.12(d) prohibits such action.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A state law that requires periodic statements to be sent more than 14 days before the end of a free-ride period would not be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A state law that permits consumers to assert claims and defenses against the card issuer without regard to the $50 and 100-mile limitations of Sec. 226.12(c)(3)(ii) would not be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In paragraphs ii. and iii. of this comment, compliance with state law would involve no violation of the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">7. Who may receive a chapter 4 determination. Only states (through their authorized officials) may request and receive determinations on inconsistency with respect to the fair credit billing provisions.</p><p class="depth0">8. Preemption determination--Arizona. Effective October 1, 1983, the Board has determined that the following provisions in the State law of Arizona are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Section 44-287 B.5--Disclosure of final cash price balance. This provision is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the final cash price balance is the same as the Federal amount financed, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a term different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">Section 44-287 B.6--Disclosure of finance charge. This provision is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the finance charge is different from the amount of the Federal finance charge, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different amount.</p><p class="depth0">Section 44-287 B.7--Disclosure of the time balance. The time balance disclosure provision is preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the amount of the Federal total of payments, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a term different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">9. Preemption determination--Florida. Effective October 1, 1983, the Board has determined that the following provisions in the State law of Florida are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Sections 520.07(2)(f) and 520.34(2)(f)--Disclosure of amount financed. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount is different from the Federal amount financed, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different amount.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 520.07(2)(g), 520.34(2)(g), and 520.35(2)(d)--Disclosure of finance charge and a description of its components. The finance charge disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the finance charge is different from the Federal amount, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different amount. The requirement to describe or itemize the components of the finance charge, which is also included in these provisions, is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 520.07(2)(h) and 520.34(2)(h)--Disclosure of total of payments. The total of payments disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount differs from the amount of the Federal total of payments, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different amount than the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 520.07(2)(i) and 520.34(2)(i)--Disclosure of deferred payment price. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the Federal total sale price, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a different term than the Federal law to represent the same amount as the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">10. Preemption determination--Missouri. Effective October 1, 1983, the Board has determined that the following provisions in the

State law of Missouri are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Sections 365.070-6(9) and 408.260-5(6)--Disclosure of principal balance. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the principal balance is the same as the Federal amount financed, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a term different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 365.070-6(10) and 408.260-5(7)--Disclosure of time price differential and time charge, respectively. These disclosures are preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the Federal finance charge, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a term different from the Federal law to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 365.070-2 and 408.260-2--Use of the terms time price differential and time charge in certain notices to the buyer. In those transactions in which the State disclosure of the time price differential or time charge is preempted, the use of the terms in this notice also is preempted. The notice itself is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 365.070-6(11) and 408.260-5(8)--Disclosure of time balance. The time balance disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the amount of the Federal total of payments, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a different term than the Federal law to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">Sections 365.070-6(12) and 408.260-5(9)--Disclosure of time sale price. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the Federal total sale price, since in such transactions the State law requires the use of a different term from the Federal law to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">11. Preemption determination--Mississippi. Effective October 1, 1984, the Board has determined that the following provision in the State law of Mississippi is preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Section 63-19-31(2)(g)--Disclosure of finance charge. This disclosure is preempted in those cases in which the term finance charge would be used under State law to describe a different amount than the finance charge disclosed under Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">12. Preemption determination--South Carolina. Effective October 1, 1984, the Board has determined that the following provision in the State law of South Carolina is preempted by the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">Section 37-10-102(c)--Disclosure of due-on-sale clause. This provision is preempted, but only to the extent that the creditor is required to include the disclosure with the segregated Federal disclosures. If the creditor may comply with the State law by placing the due-on-sale notice apart from the Federal disclosures, the state law is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">13. Preemption determination--Arizona. Effective October 1, 1986, the Board has determined that the following provision in the State law of Arizona is preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Section 6-621A.2--Use of the term the total sum of $-------- in certain notices provided to borrowers. This term describes the same item that is disclosed under Federal law as the total of payments. Since the State law requires the use of a different term than Federal law to describe the same item, the State-required term is preempted. The notice itself is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The State disclosure notice that incorporated the above preempted term was amended on May 4, 1987, to provide that disclosures must now be made pursuant to the Federal disclosure provisions.)</p><p class="depth0">14. Preemption determination--Indiana. Effective October 1, 1988, the Board has determined that the following provision in the State law of Indiana is preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Section 23-2-5-8--Inclusion of the loan broker's fees and charges in the calculation of, among other items, the finance charge and annual percentage rate disclosed to potential borrowers. This disclosure is inconsistent with sections 106(a) and Sec. 226.4(a) of the Federal statute and regulation, respectively, and is preempted in those instances where the use of the same term would disclose a different amount than that required to be disclosed under Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">15. Preemption determination--Wisconsin. Effective October 1, 1991, the Board has determined that the following provisions in the state law of Wisconsin are preempted by the federal law:</p><p class="depth0">Section 422.308(1)--the disclosure of the annual percentage rate in cases where the amount of the annual percentage rate disclosed to consumers under the state law differs from the amount that would be disclosed under federal law, since in those cases the state law requires the use of the same term as the federal law to represent a different amount than the federal law.</p><p class="depth0">Section 766.565(5)--the provision permitting a creditor to include in an open-end home equity agreement authorization to declare the account balance due and payable upon receiving notice of termination from a non-obligor spouse, since such provision is inconsistent with the purpose of the federal law.</p><p class="depth0">28(b) Equivalent disclosure requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A state disclosure may be substituted for a Federal disclosure only after the Board has made a finding of substantial

similarity. Thus, the creditor may not unilaterally choose to make a state disclosure in place of a Federal disclosure, even if it believes that the state disclosure is substantially similar. Since the rule stated in Sec. 226.28(b) does not extend to any requirement relating to the finance charge or annual percentage rate, no state provision on computation, description, or disclosure of these terms may be substituted for the Federal provision.</p><p class="depth0">28(d) Special Rule for Credit and Charge Cards</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The standard that applies to preemption of state laws as they affect transactions of the type subject to Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.9(e) differs from the preemption standards generally applicable under the Truth in Lending Act. The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act fully preempts state laws relating to the disclosure of credit information in consumer credit or charge card applications or solicitations. (For purposes of this section, a single credit or charge card application or solicitation that may be used to open either an account for consumer purposes or an account for business purposes is deemed to be a ``consumer credit or charge card application or solicitation.'') For example, a state law requiring disclosure of credit terms in direct mail solicitations for consumer credit card accounts is preempted. A state law requiring disclosures in telephone applications for consumer credit card accounts also is preempted, even if it applies to applications initiated by the consumer rather than the issuer, because the state law relates to the disclosure of credit information in applications or solicitations within the general field of preemption, that is, consumer credit and charge cards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations on field of preemption. Preemption under the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act does not extend to state laws applying to types of credit other than open-end consumer credit and charge card accounts. Thus, for example, a state law is not preempted as it applies to disclosures in credit and charge card applications and solicitations solely for business-purpose accounts. On the other hand, state credit disclosure laws will not apply to a single application or solicitation to open either an account for consumer purposes or an account for business purposes. Such ``dual purpose'' applications and solicitations are treated as ``consumer credit or charge card applications or solicitations'' under this section and state credit disclosure laws applicable to them are preempted. Preemption under this statute does not extend to state laws applicable to home equity plans; preemption determinations in this area are based on the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act, as implemented in Sec. 226.5b of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Laws not preempted. State laws relating to disclosures concerning credit and charge cards other than in applications, solicitations, or renewal notices are not preempted under Sec. 226.28(d). In addition, state laws regulating the terms of credit and charge card accounts are not preempted, nor are laws preempted that regulate the form or content of information unrelated to the information required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.9(e). Finally, state laws concerning the enforcement of the requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.9(e) and state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices concerning credit and charge card applications, solicitations and renewals are not preempted. Examples of laws that are not preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">A state law that requires card issuers to offer a grace period or that prohibits certain fees in credit and charge card transactions.</p><p class="depth0">A state retail installment sales law or a state plain language law, except to the extent that it regulates the disclosure of credit information in applications, solicitations and renewals of accounts of the type subject to Sec. Sec. 226.5a and 226.9(e).</p><p class="depth0">A state law requiring notice of a consumer's rights under antidiscrimination or similar laws or a state law requiring notice about credit information available from state authorities.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 111 and 171 (a) and (c).</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.6 (b) and (c), and Interpretation Sec. 226.604.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: Section 226.28 implements amended section 111 of the Act. The test for preemption of state laws relating to disclosure and advertising is now whether the state law ``contradicts'' the Federal, rather than whether state requirements are ``different.''</p><p class="depth0">The revised regulation contains no counterpart to Sec. 226.6(c) of the previous regulation concerning placement of inconsistent disclosures. It also reflects the statutory amendment providing that once the Board determines that a state-required disclosure is inconsistent with Federal law, the creditor may not make the state disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.29--State Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">29(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Classes eligible. The state determines the classes of transactions for which it will request an exemption, and makes its application for those classes. Classes might be, for example, all open-end credit transactions, all open-end and closed-end transactions, or all transactions in which the creditor is a bank.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantial similarity. The ``substantially similar'' standard requires that state statutory or regulatory provisions and state interpretations of those provisions be generally the same as the Federal Act and Regulation Z. This includes the requirement that state provisions for reimbursement to consumers for overcharges be at least equivalent to those required in section 108 of the act. A State will be eligible for an exemption even if its law covers classes of transactions not covered by the Federal law. For example, if a state's law covers agricultural credit, this will not prevent the Board from granting an exemption for consumer credit, even though agricultural credit is not covered by the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Adequate enforcement. The standard requiring adequate provision for enforcement generally means that appropriate state officials must be authorized to enforce the state law through procedures and sanctions comparable to those available to Federal enforcement agencies. Furthermore, state law must make adequate provision for enforcement of the reimbursement rules.</p><p class="depth0">4. Exemptions granted. Effective October 1, 1982, the Board has granted the following exemptions from portions of the revised Truth in Lending Act:</p><p class="depth0">Maine. Credit or lease transactions subject to the Maine Consumer Credit Code and its implementing regulations are exempt from chapters 2, 4 and 5 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor or lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">Connecticut. Credit transactions subject to the Connecticut Truth in Lending Act are exempt from chapters 2 and 4 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">Massachusetts. Credit transactions subject to the Massachusetts Truth in Lending Act are exempt from chapters 2 and 4 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">Oklahoma. Credit or lease transactions subject to the Oklahoma Consumer Credit Code are exempt from chapters 2 and 5 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to sections 132 through 135 of the Federal Act, nor does it apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor or lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">Wyoming. Credit transactions subject to the Wyoming Consumer Credit Code are exempt from chapter 2 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">29(b) Civil liability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Not eligible for exemption. The provision that an exemption may not extend to sections 130 and 131 of the Act assures that consumers retain access to both Federal and State courts in seeking damages or civil penalties for violations, while creditors retain the defenses specified in those sections.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Sections 108, 123, and 171(b).</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Appendix B.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.12.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: The procedures that states must follow to seek exemptions are now located in an appendix. Exemptions under the previous regulation will be automatically revoked on April 1, 1982, when compliance with the new regulation is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.30--Limitation on Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of coverage. The requirement of this section applies to consumer credit obligations secured by a dwelling (as dwelling is defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(19)) in which the annual percentage rate may increase after consummation (or during the term of the plan, in the case of open-end credit) as a result of an increase in the interest rate component of the finance charge--whether those increases are tied to an index or formula or are within a creditor's discretion. The section applies to credit sales as well as loans. Examples of credit obligations subject to this section include:</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling-secured credit obligations that require variable-rate disclosures under the regulation because the interest rate may increase during the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling-secured open-end credit plans entered into before November 7, 1989 (the effective date of the home equity rules) that are not considered variable-rate obligations for purposes of disclosure under the regulation but where the creditor reserves the contractual right to increase the interest rate--periodic rate and corresponding annual percentage rate--during the term of the plan.
In contrast, credit obligations in which there is no contractual right to increase the interest rate during the term of the obligation are not subject to this section. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">``Shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgage loans that have a fixed rate of interest and a shared-appreciation feature based on the consumer's equity in the mortgaged property. (The appreciation share is payable in a lump sum at a specified time.)</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling-secured fixed-rate closed-end balloon-payment mortgage loans and dwelling-secured fixed-rate open-end plans with a stated term that the creditor may renew at maturity. (Contrast with the renewable balloon-payment mortgage instrument described in comment 17(c)(1)-11.)</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling-secured fixed rate closed-end multiple advance transactions in which each

advance is disclosed as a separate transaction.</p><p class="depth0">``Price level adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation.
The requirement of this section does not apply to credit obligations entered into prior to December 9, 1987. Consequently, new advances under open-end credit plans existing prior to December 9, 1987, are not subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Refinanced obligations. On or after December 9, 1987, when a credit obligation is refinanced, as defined in Sec. 226.20(a), the new obligation is subject to this section if it is dwelling-secured and allows for increases in the interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assumptions. On or after December 9, 1987, when a credit obligation is assumed, as defined in Sec. 226.20(b), the obligation becomes subject to this section if it is dwelling-secured and allows for increases in the interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Modifications of obligations. The modification of an obligation, regardless of when the obligation was entered into, is generally not covered by this section. For example, increasing the credit limit on a dwelling-secured, open-end plan with a variable interest rate entered into before the effective date of the rule does not make the obligation subject to this section. If, however, a security interest in a dwelling is added on or after December 9, 1987, to a credit obligation that allows for interest rate increases, the obligation becomes subject to this section. Similarly, if a variable interest rate feature is added to a dwelling-secured credit obligation, the obligation becomes subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">5. Land trusts. In some states, a land trust is used in residential real estate transactions. (See discussion in comment 3(a)-8).) If a consumer-purpose loan that allows for interest rate increases is secured by an assignment of a beneficial interest in a land trust that holds title to a consumer's dwelling, that loan is subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">6. Relationship to other sections. Unless otherwise provided for in the commentary to this section, other provisions of the regulation such as definitions, exemptions, rules and interpretations also apply to this section where appropriate. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">An adjustable interest rate business-purpose loan is not subject to this section even if the loan is secured by a dwelling because such credit extensions are not subject to the regulation. (See generally Sec. 226.3(a).)</p><p class="depth0">Creditors subject to this section are only those that fall within the definition of a creditor in Sec. 226.2(a)(17).</p><p class="depth0">7. Consumer credit contract. Creditors are required to specify a lifetime maximum interest rate in their credit contracts--the instrument that creates personal liability and generally contains the terms and conditions of the agreement (for example, a promissory note or home-equity line of credit agreement). In some states, the signing of a commitment letter may create a binding obligation, for example, constituting consummation as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(13). The maximum interest rate must be included in the credit contract, but a creditor may include the rate ceiling in the commitment instrument as well.</p><p class="depth0">8. Manner of stating the maximum interest rate. The maximum interest rate must be stated in the credit contract either as a specific amount or in any other manner that would allow the consumer to easily ascertain, at the time of entering into the obligation, what the rate ceiling will be over the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, the following statements would be sufficiently specific</p><p class="depth0">A. The maximum interest rate will not exceed X%.</p><p class="depth0">B. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points above the initial rate of Y%.</p><p class="depth0">C. The interest rate will not exceed X%, or X percentage points above [a rate to be determined at some future point in time], whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">D. The maximum interest rate will not exceed X%, or the state usury ceiling, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The following statements would not comply with this section</p><p class="depth0">A. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points over the prevailing market rate.</p><p class="depth0">B. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points above [a rate to be determined at some future point in time].</p><p class="depth0">C. The interest rate will not exceed the state usury ceiling which is currently X%.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A creditor may state the maximum rate in terms of a maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed. Under an open-end credit plan, this normally would be the corresponding annual percentage rate. (See generally Sec. 226.6(a)(1)(ii) and (b)(4)(i)(A).)</p><p class="depth0">9. Multiple interest rate ceilings. Creditors are not prohibited from setting multiple interest rate ceilings. For example, on loans with multiple variable-rate features, creditors may establish a maximum interest rate for each feature. To illustrate, in a variable-rate loan that has an option to convert to a fixed rate, a creditor may set one maximum interest rate for the initially imposed index-based variable-rate feature and another for the conversion option. Of course, a creditor may establish one maximum interest rate applicable to all features.</p><p class="depth0">10. Interest rate charged after default. State law may allow an interest rate after default higher than the contract rate in effect at the

time of default; however, the interest rate after default is subject to a maximum interest rate set forth in a credit obligation that is otherwise subject to this section. This rule applies only in situations in which a post-default agreement is still considered part of the original obligation.</p><p class="depth0">11. Increasing the maximum interest rate--general rule. Generally, a creditor may not increase the maximum interest rate originally set on a credit obligation subject to this section unless the consumer and the creditor enter into a new obligation. Therefore, under an open-end plan, a creditor may not increase the rate ceiling imposed merely because there is an increase in the credit limit. If an open-end plan is closed and another opened, a new rate ceiling may be imposed. Furthermore, where an open-end plan has a fixed maturity and a creditor renews the plan at maturity, or enters into a closed-end credit transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set at that time. If the open-end plan provides for a repayment phase, the maximum interest rate cannot be increased when the repayment phase begins unless the agreement provided for such an increase. For a closed-end credit transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set only if the transaction is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation. (The exceptions in Sec. 226.20(a)(1)-(5) which limit what transactions are considered refinancings for purposes of disclosure do not apply with respect to increasing a rate ceiling that has been imposed; if a transaction is satisfied and replaced, the rate ceiling may be increased.)</p><p class="depth0">12. Increasing the maximum interest rate--assumption of an obligation. If an obligation subject to this section is assumed by a new obligor and the original obligor is released from liability, the maximum interest rate set on the obligation may be increased as part of the assumption agreement. (This rule applies whether or not the transaction constitutes an assumption as defined in Sec. 226.20(b).)</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, Pub.

L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552 which provides that, effective December 9, 1987, adjustable-rate mortgages must include a limitation on the interest rate that may apply during the term of the mortgage loan. An adjustable-rate mortgage loan is defined in section 1204 as ``any loan secured by a lien on a one-to-four family dwelling unit, including a condominium unit, cooperative housing unit, or mobile home, where the loan is made pursuant to an agreement under which the creditor may, from time to time, adjust the rate of interest.'' The rule in this section incorporates section 1204 into Regulation Z and limits the scope of section 1204 to dwelling-secured consumer credit subject to the Truth in Lending Act, in which a creditor has the contractual right to increase the interest rate during the term of the credit obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart E--Special Rules for Certain Home Mortgage Transactions</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.31--General Rules</p><p class="depth0">31(c) Timing of disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">1. Furnishing disclosures.

Pre-consummation waiting period. A creditor must furnish Sec. 226.32 disclosures at least three business days prior to consummation. Under Sec. 226.32, ``business day'' has the same meaning as the rescission rule in comment 2(a)(6)-2--all calendar days except Sundays and the federal legal holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). However, while the disclosure rule under Sec. Sec. 226.15 and 226.23 extends to midnight of the third business day, the rule under Sec. 226.32 does not. For example, under Sec. 226.32, if disclosures were provided on a Friday, consummation could occur any time on Tuesday, the third business day following receipt of the disclosures. If the timing of the rescission rule were to be used, consummation could not occur until after midnight on Tuesday.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 31(c)(1)(i) Change in terms.</p><p class="depth0">1.

A change in terms may result from a formal written agreement or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sale of optional products at consummation. If the consumer finances the purchase of optional products such as credit insurance and as a result the monthly payment differs from what was previously disclosed under Sec. 226.32, redisclosure is required and a new three-day waiting period applies. (See comment 32(c)(3)-1 on when optional items may be included in the regular payment disclosure.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 31(c)(1)(ii) Telephone disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Telephone disclosures.

Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right to the three-day waiting period only after receiving the disclosures required by Sec. 226.32 and only if the

circumstances meet the criteria for establishing a bona fide personal financial emergency under Sec. 226.23(e). Whether these criteria are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure during the three-day period is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer entitled to the three-day waiting period must sign the handwritten statement for the waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(2) Disclosures for reverse mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">1. Business days. For purposes of providing reverse mortgage disclosures, ``business day'' has the same meaning as in comment 31(c)(1)-1--all calendar days except Sundays and the Federal legal holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). This means if disclosures are provided on a Friday, consummation could occur any time on Tuesday, the third business day following receipt of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Open-end plans. Disclosures for open-end reverse mortgages must be provided at least three business days before the first transaction under the plan (see Sec. 226.5(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">31(d) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.</p><p class="depth0">1.

This paragraph applies to the disclosure of any numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual percentage rate, or payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest charge that will be collected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the disclosures were not labeled as estimates.

Application date. An application is deemed received when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are normally transmitted. (See Sec. 226.19(a).) For example, if a borrower applies for a 10-year loan on September 30 and the creditor counteroffers with a 7-year loan on October 10, the application is deemed received in September and the creditor must measure the annual percentage rate against the appropriate Treasury security yield as of August 15. An application transmitted through an intermediary agent or broker is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker. (See comment 19(b)-3 to determine whether a transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.)</p><p class="depth0">2. When fifteenth not a business day. If the 15th day of the month immediately preceding the application date is not a business day, the creditor must use the yield as of the business day immediately preceding the 15th.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculating annual percentage rates for variable-rate loans and discount loans. Creditors must use the rules set out in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1) in calculating the annual percentage rate for variable-rate loans (assume the rate in effect at the time of disclosure remains unchanged) and for discount, premium, and stepped-rate transactions (which must reflect composite annual percentage rates).</p><p class="depth0">4. Treasury securities. To determine the yield on comparable Treasury securities for the annual percentage rate test, creditors may use the yield on actively traded issues adjusted to constant maturities published in the Board's ``Selected Interest Rates'' (statistical release H-15). Creditors must use the yield corresponding to the constant maturity that is closest to the loan's maturity. If the loan's maturity is exactly halfway between security maturities, the annual percentage rate on the loan should be compared with the yield for Treasury securities having the lower yield. In determining the loan's maturity, creditors may rely on the rules in Sec. 226.17(c)(4) regarding irregular first payment periods. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the H-15 contains a yield for Treasury securities with constant maturities of 7 years and 10 years and no maturity in between, the annual percentage rate for an 8-year mortgage loan is compared with the yield of securities having a 7-year maturity, and the annual percentage rate for a 9-year mortgage loan is compared with the yield of securities having a 10-year maturity.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a mortgage loan has a term of 15 years, and the H-15 contains a yield of 5.21 percent for constant maturities of 10 years, and also contains a yield of 6.33 percent for constant maturities of 20 years, then the creditor compares the annual percentage rate for a 15-year mortgage loan with the yield for constant maturities of 10 years.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If a mortgage loan has a term of 30 years, and the H-15 does not contain a yield for 30-year constant maturities, but contains a yield for 20-year constant maturities, and an average yield for securities with remaining terms to maturity of 25 years and over, then the annual percentage rate on the loan is compared with the yield for 20-year constant maturities.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Total loan amount. For purposes of the ``points and fees'' test, the total loan amount is calculated by taking the amount financed, as determined according to Sec. 226.18(b), and deducting any cost listed in Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(iii) and Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(iv) that is both included as points and fees under Sec. 226.32(b)(1) and financed by the creditor. Some examples follow, each using a $10,000 amount borrowed, a $300 appraisal fee, and $400 in points. A $500 premium for optional credit life insurance is used in one example.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for a creditor-conducted appraisal and pays $400 in points at closing, the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b) is $9,900 ($10,000 plus the $300 appraisal fee that is paid to and financed by the creditor, less $400 in prepaid finance charges). The $300 appraisal fee paid to the creditor is added to other points and fees under Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(iii). It is deducted from the amount financed ($9,900) to derive a total loan amount of $9,600.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer pays the $300 fee for the creditor-conducted appraisal in cash at closing, the $300 is included in the points and fees calculation because it is paid to the creditor. However, because the $300 is not financed by the creditor, the fee is not part of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b). In this case, the amount financed is the same as the total loan amount: $9,600 ($10,000, less $400 in prepaid finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for an appraisal conducted by someone other than the creditor or an affiliate, the $300 fee is not included with other points and fees under Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(iii). The amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b) is $9,900 ($10,000 plus the $300 fee for an independently-conducted appraisal that is financed by the creditor, less the $400 paid in cash and deducted as prepaid finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">iv. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for a creditor-conducted appraisal and a $500 single premium for optional credit life insurance, and pays $400 in points at closing, the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(b) is $10,400 ($10,000, plus the $300 appraisal fee that is paid to and financed by the creditor, plus the $500 insurance premium that is financed by the creditor, less $400 in prepaid finance charges). The $300 appraisal fee paid to the creditor is added to other points and fees under Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(iii), and the $500 insurance premium is added under 226.32(b)(1)(iv). The $300 and $500 costs are deducted from the amount financed ($10,400) to derive a total loan amount of $9,600.</p><p class="depth0">2. Annual adjustment of $400 amount. A mortgage loan is covered by Sec. 226.32 if the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan consummation exceed the greater of $400 or 8 percent of the total loan amount. The $400 figure is adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual percentage change in the CPI that was in effect on the preceding June 1. The Board will publish adjustments after the June figures become available each year. The adjustment for the upcoming year will be included in any proposed commentary published in the fall, and incorporated into the commentary the following spring. The adjusted figures are:</p><p class="depth0">i. For 1996, $412, reflecting a 3.00 percent increase in the CPI-U from June 1994 to June 1995, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For 1997, $424, reflecting a 2.9 percent increase in the CPI-U from June 1995 to June 1996, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0">iii.

Exemption limited. Section 226.32(a)(2) lists certain transactions exempt from the provisions of Sec. 226.32. Nevertheless, those transactions may be subject to the provisions of Sec. 226.35, including any provisions of Sec. 226.32 to which Sec. 226.35 refers. See 12 CFR 226.35(a).</p><p class="depth0">32(b) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.32(b)(1)(i) includes in the total ``points and fees'' items defined as finance charges under Sec. Sec. 226.4(a) and 226.(4)(b). Items excluded from the finance charge under other provisions of Sec. 226.4 are not included in the total ``points and fees'' under paragraph 32(b)(1)(i), but may be included in ``points and fees'' under paragraphs 32(b)(1)(ii) and 32(b)(1)(iii). Interest, including per-diem interest, is excluded from ``points and fees'' under Sec. 226.32(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage broker fees. In determining ``points and fees'' for purposes of this section, compensation paid by a consumer to a mortgage broker (directly or through the creditor for delivery to the broker) is included in the calculation whether or not the amount is disclosed as a finance charge. Mortgage broker fees that are not paid by the consumer are not included. Mortgage broker fees already included in the calculation as finance charges under Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(i) need not be counted again under Sec. 226.32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. Section 226.32(b)(1)(iii) defines ``points and fees'' to include all items listed in Sec. 226.4(c)(7), other than amounts held for the future payment of taxes. An item listed in Sec. 226.4(c)(7) may be excluded from the ``points and fees'' calculation, however, if the charge is reasonable, the creditor receives no direct or indirect compensation from the charge, and the charge is not paid to an affiliate of the creditor. For example, a reasonable fee paid by the consumer to an independent, third-party appraiser may be excluded from the ``points and fees'' calculation (assuming no compensation is paid to the creditor). A fee paid by the consumer for an appraisal performed by the creditor must be included in the calculation, even though the fee may be excluded from the finance charge if it is bona fide and reasonable in amount.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Premium amount. In determining ``points and fees'' for purposes of this section, premiums paid at or before closing for credit insurance are included whether they are paid in cash or financed, and whether the amount represents the entire premium for the coverage or an initial payment.</p><p class="depth0">32(c) Disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Format. The disclosures must be clear and conspicuous but need not be in any particular type size or typeface, nor presented in any particular manner. The disclosures need not be a part of the note or mortgage document.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(c)(3) Regular payment; balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The regular payment is the amount due from the borrower at regular intervals, such as monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or annually. There must be at least two payments, and the payments must be in an amount and at such intervals that they fully amortize the amount owed. In disclosing the regular payment, creditors may rely on the rules set forth in Sec. 226.18(g); however, the amounts for voluntary items, such as credit life insurance, may be included in the regular payment disclosure only if the consumer has previously agreed to the amounts.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the loan has more than one payment level, the regular payment for each level must be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. In a 30-year graduated payment mortgage where there will be payments of $300 for the first 120 months, $400 for the next 120 months, and $500 for the last 120 months, each payment amount must be disclosed, along with the length of time that the payment will be in effect.</p><p class="depth0">B. If interest and principal are paid at different times, the regular amount for each must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">C. In discounted or premium variable-rate transactions where the creditor sets the initial interest rate and later rate adjustments are determined by an index or formula, the creditor must disclose both the initial payment based on the discount or premium and the payment that will be in effect thereafter. Additional explanatory material which does not detract from the required disclosures may accompany the disclosed amounts. For example, if a monthly payment is $250 for the first six months and then increases based on an index and margin, the creditor could use language such as the following: ``Your regular monthly payment will be $250 for six months. After six months your regular monthly payment will be based on an index and margin, which currently would make your payment $350. Your actual payment at that time may be higher or lower.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(c)(4) Variable-rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating ``worst-case'' payment example. Creditors may rely on instructions in Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) for calculating the maximum possible increases in rates in the shortest possible timeframe, based on the face amount of the note (not the hypothetical loan amount of $10,000 required by Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B)). The creditor must provide a maximum payment for each payment level, where a payment schedule provides for more than one payment level and more than one maximum payment amount is possible.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(c)(5) Amount borrowed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Optional insurance; debt-cancellation coverage. This disclosure is required when the amount borrowed in a refinancing includes premiums or other charges for credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance, or debt-cancellation coverage (whether or not the debt-cancellation coverage is insurance under applicable law) that provides for

cancellation of all or part of the consumer's liability in the event of the loss of life, health, or income or in the case of accident. See comment 4(d)(3)-2 and comment app. G and H-2 regarding terminology for debt-cancellation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">32(d) Limitations.</p><p class="depth0">32(d) Limitations</p><p class="depth0">1. Additional prohibitions applicable under other sections. Section 226.34 sets forth certain prohibitions in connection with mortgage credit subject to Sec. 226.32, in addition to the limitations in Sec. 226.32(d). Further, Sec. 226.35(b) prohibits certain practices in connection with transactions that meet the coverage test in Sec. 226.35(a). Because the coverage test in Sec. 226.35(a) is generally broader than the coverage test in Sec. 226.32(a), most Sec. 226.32 mortgage loans are also subject to the prohibitions set forth in Sec. 226.35(b) (such as escrows), in addition to the limitations in Sec. 226.32(d).</p><p class="depth0">2. Effective date. For guidance on the application of the Board's revisions published on July 30, 2008 to Sec. 226.32, see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(1)(i) Balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. The repayment schedule for a Sec. 226.32 mortgage loan with a term of less than five years must fully amortize the outstanding principal balance through ``regular periodic payments.'' A payment is a ``regular periodic payment'' if it is not more than twice the amount of other payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(2) Negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">1. Negative amortization. The prohibition against negative amortization in a mortgage covered by Sec. 226.32 does not preclude reasonable increases in the principal balance that result from events permitted by the legal obligation unrelated to the payment schedule. For example, when a consumer fails to obtain property insurance and the creditor purchases insurance, the creditor may add a reasonable premium to the consumer's principal balance, to the extent permitted by the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(4) Increased interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate transactions. The limitation on interest rate increases does not apply to rate increases resulting from changes in accordance with the legal obligation in a variable-rate transaction, even if the increase occurs after default by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(5) Rebates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of refunds. The limitation applies only to refunds of precomputed (such as add-on) interest and not to any other charges that are considered finance charges under Sec. 226.4 (for example, points and fees paid at closing). The calculation of the refund of interest includes odd-days interest, whether paid at or after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(6) Prepayment penalties.</p><p class="depth0">1. State law. For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest, if using the actuarial method defined by applicable state law results in a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, creditors should use the state law definition in determining if a refund is a prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(7) Prepayment penalty exception.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(7)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating debt-to-income ratio. ``Debt'' does not include amounts paid by the borrower in cash at closing or amounts from the loan proceeds that directly repay an existing debt. Creditors may consider combined debt-to-income ratios for transactions involving joint applicants. For more information about obligations and inflows that may constitute ``debt'' or ``income'' for purposes of Sec. 226.32(d)(7)(iii), see comment 34(a)(4)-6 and comment 34(a)(4)(iii)(C)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Verification. Creditors shall verify income in the manner described in Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(ii) and the related comments. Creditors may verify debt with a credit report. However, a credit report may not reflect certain obligations undertaken just before or at consummation of the transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the transaction. Section 226.34(a)(4) may require creditors to consider such obligations; see comment 34(a)(4)-3 and comment 34(a)(4)(ii)(C)-1.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interaction with Regulation B. Section 226.32(d)(7)(iii) does not require or permit the creditor to make inquiries or verifications that would be prohibited by Regulation B, 12 CFR part 202.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(7)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment change. Section 226.32(d)(7) sets forth the conditions under which a mortgage transaction subject to this section may have a prepayment penalty. Section 226.32(d)(7)(iv) lists as a condition that the amount of the periodic payment of principal or interest or both may not change during the four-year period following consummation. The following examples show whether prepayment penalties are permitted or prohibited under Sec. 226.32(d)(7)(iv) in particular circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">i. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month. Under the loan agreement, the first possible date that a payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014. A prepayment penalty is permitted with this mortgage transaction provided that the other Sec. 226.32(d)(7) conditions are met, that is: provided that the prepayment penalty is permitted by other applicable law, the penalty expires on or before Dec. 31, 2011, the penalty will not apply if the source of the prepayment funds is a refinancing by the creditor or its affiliate, and at consummation the consumer's total monthly debts do

not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's monthly gross income, as verified.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month. Under the loan agreement, the first possible date that a payment in a different amount may be due is December 31, 2013. A prepayment penalty is prohibited with this mortgage transaction because the payment may change within the four-year period following consummation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Initial payments for a graduated-payment transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month. Under the loan agreement, the first possible date that a payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014. A prepayment penalty is permitted with this mortgage transaction provided that the other Sec. 226.32(d)(7) conditions are met, that is: provided that the prepayment penalty is permitted by other applicable law, the penalty expires on or before December 31, 2011, the penalty will not apply if the source of the prepayment funds is a refinancing by the creditor or its affiliate, and at consummation the consumer's total monthly debts do not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's monthly gross income, as verified.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Initial payments for a step-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month. Under the loan agreement, the first possible date that a payment in a different amount may be due is December 31, 2013. A prepayment penalty is prohibited with this mortgage transaction because the payment may change within the four-year period following consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment changes excluded. Payment changes due to the following circumstances are not considered payment changes for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">i. A change in the amount of a periodic payment that is allocated to principal or interest that does not change the total amount of the periodic payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The borrower's actual unanticipated late payment, delinquency, or default; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. The borrower's voluntary payment of additional amounts (for example when a consumer chooses to make a payment of interest and principal on a loan that only requires the consumer to pay interest).</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(8) Due-on-demand clause.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(8)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to meet repayment terms. A creditor may terminate a loan and accelerate the balance when the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms provided for in the agreement; a creditor may do so, however, only if the consumer actually fails to make payments. For example, a creditor may not terminate and accelerate if the consumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a branch rather than the main office of the creditor. If a consumer files for or is placed in bankruptcy, the creditor may terminate and accelerate under this provision if the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the agreement. Section 226.32(d)(8)(ii) does not override any state or other law that requires a creditor to notify a borrower of a right to cure, or otherwise places a duty on the creditor before it can terminate a loan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(8)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Impairment of security. A creditor may terminate a loan and accelerate the balance if the consumer's action or inaction adversely affects the creditor's security for the loan, or any right of the creditor in that security. Action or inaction by third parties does not, in itself, permit the creditor to terminate and accelerate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A creditor may terminate and accelerate, for example, if:</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer transfers title to the property or sells the property without the permission of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer fails to maintain required insurance on the dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">C. The consumer fails to pay taxes on the property.</p><p class="depth0">D. The consumer permits the filing of a lien senior to that held by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">E. The sole consumer obligated on the credit dies.</p><p class="depth0">F. The property is taken through eminent domain.</p><p class="depth0">G. A prior lienholder forecloses.</p><p class="depth0">ii. By contrast, the filing of a judgment against the consumer would permit termination and acceleration only if the amount of the judgment and collateral subject to the judgment is such that the creditor's security is adversely affected. If the consumer commits waste or otherwise destructively uses or fails to maintain the property such that the action adversely affects the security, the loan may be terminated and the balance accelerated. Illegal use of the property by the consumer would permit termination and acceleration if it subjects the property to seizure. If one of two consumers obligated on a loan dies, the creditor may terminate the loan and accelerate the balance if the security is adversely affected. If the consumer moves out of the dwelling that secures the loan and that action adversely affects the security, the creditor may terminate a loan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(e)(1) Repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Determining repayment ability. The information provided to the creditor in connection with Sec. 226.32(d)(7) may be used to show that the creditor considered the consumer's income and obligations before extending the credit. Any expected income can be considered by the creditor, except equity income that the consumer would obtain through the foreclosure of a mortgage covered by Sec. 226.32. For example, a creditor may use information about income other than regular salary or

wages such as gifts, expected retirement payments, or income from housecleaning or childcare. The creditor also may use unverified income, as long as the creditor has a reasonable basis for believing that the income exists and will support the loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(e)(2) Home-Improvement Contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint payees. If a creditor pays a contractor with an instrument jointly payable to the contractor and the consumer, the instrument must name as payee each consumer who is primarily obligated on the note.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(e)(3) Notice to Assignee.</p><p class="depth0">1. Subsequent sellers or assignors. Any person, whether or not the original creditor, that sells or assigns a mortgage subject to this section must furnish the notice of potential liability to the purchaser or assignee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. While the notice of potential liability need not be in any particular format, the notice must be prominent. Placing it on the face of the note, such as with a stamp, is one means of satisfying the prominence requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.33--Requirements for Reverse Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">33(a) Definition.</p><p class="depth0">1. Nonrecourse transaction. A nonrecourse reverse mortgage transaction limits the homeowner's liability to the proceeds of the sale of the home (or any lesser amount specified in the credit obligation). If a transaction structured as a closed-end reverse mortgage transaction allows recourse against the consumer, and the annual percentage rate or the points and fees exceed those specified under Sec. 226.32(a)(1), the transaction is subject to all the requirements of Sec. 226.32, including the limitations concerning balloon payments and negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Default. Default is not defined by the statute or regulation, but rather by the legal obligation between the parties and state or other law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Definite term or maturity date. To meet the definition of a reverse mortgage transaction, a creditor cannot require any principal, interest, or shared appreciation or equity to be due and payable (other than in the case of default) until after the consumer's death, transfer of the dwelling, or the consumer ceases to occupy the dwelling as a principal dwelling. Some state laws require legal obligations secured by a mortgage to specify a definite maturity date or term of repayment in the instrument. An obligation may state a definite maturity date or term of repayment and still meet the definition of a reverse-mortgage transaction if the maturity date or term of repayment used would not operate to cause maturity prior to the occurrence of any of the maturity events recognized in the regulation. For example, some reverse mortgage programs specify that the final maturity date is the borrower's 150th birthday; other programs include a shorter term but provide that the term is automatically extended for consecutive periods if none of the other maturity events has yet occurred. These programs would be permissible.</p><p class="depth0">33(c) Projected total cost of credit.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(c)(1) Costs to consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Costs and charges to consumer--relation to finance charge. All costs and charges to the consumer that are incurred in a reverse mortgage transaction are included in the projected total cost of credit, and thus in the total annual loan cost rates, whether or not the cost or charge is a finance charge under Sec. 226.4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Annuity costs. As part of the credit transaction, some creditors require or permit a consumer to purchase an annuity that immediately--or at some future time--supplements or replaces the creditor's payments. The amount paid by the consumer for the annuity is a cost to the consumer under this section, regardless of whether the annuity is purchased through the creditor or a third party, or whether the purchase is mandatory or voluntary. For example, this includes the costs of an annuity that a creditor offers, arranges, assists the consumer in purchasing, or that the creditor is aware the consumer is purchasing as a part of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disposition costs excluded. Disposition costs incurred in connection with the sale or transfer of the property subject to the reverse mortgage are not included in the costs to the consumer under this paragraph. (However, see the definition of Valn in appendix K to the regulation to determine the effect certain disposition costs may have on the total annual loan cost rates.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(c)(2) Payments to consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Payments upon a specified event. The projected total cost of credit should not reflect contingent payments in which a credit to the outstanding loan balance or a payment to the consumer's estate is made upon the occurrence of an event (for example, a ``death benefit'' payable if the consumer's death occurs within a certain period of time). Thus, the table of total annual loan cost rates required under Sec. 226.33(b)(2) would not reflect such payments. At its option, however, a creditor may put an asterisk, footnote, or similar type of notation in the table next to the applicable total annual loan cost rate, and state in the body of the note, apart from the table, the assumption upon which the total annual loan cost is made and any different rate that would apply if the contingent benefit were paid.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(c)(3) Additional creditor compensation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Shared appreciation or equity. Any shared appreciation or equity that the creditor is

entitled to receive pursuant to the legal obligation must be included in the total cost of a reverse mortgage loan. For example, if a creditor agrees to a reduced interest rate on the transaction in exchange for a portion of the appreciation or equity that may be realized when the dwelling is sold, that portion is included in the projected total cost of credit.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(c)(4) Limitations on consumer liability.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. Creditors must include any limitation on the consumer's liability (such as a nonrecourse limit or an equity conservation agreement) in the projected total cost of credit. These limits and agreements protect a portion of the equity in the dwelling for the consumer or the consumer's estate. For example, the following are limitations on the consumer's liability that must be included in the projected total cost of credit:</p><p class="depth0">i. A limit on the consumer's liability to a certain percentage of the projected value of the home.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A limit on the consumer's liability to the net proceeds from the sale of the property subject to the reverse mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">2. Uniform assumption for ``net proceeds'' recourse limitations. If the legal obligation between the parties does not specify a percentage for the ``net proceeds'' liability of the consumer, for purposes of the disclosures required by Sec. 226.33, a creditor must assume that the costs associated with selling the property will equal 7 percent of the projected sale price (see the definition of the Valn symbol under appendix K(b)(6)).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.34--Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection with Credit</p><p class="depth0">Subject to Sec. 226.32</p><p class="depth0">34(a) Prohibited acts or practices for loans subject to Sec. 226.32.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(1) Home-improvement contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Pursuant to section 131(d) of the act, the act's general holder-in-due course protections do not apply to purchasers and assignees of loans covered by Sec. 226.32. For such loans, a purchaser's or other assignee's liability for all claims and defenses that the consumer could assert against the creditor is not limited to violations of the act.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(3) Refinancings within one-year period.</p><p class="depth0">1. In the borrower's interest. The determination of whether or not a refinancing covered by Sec. 226.34(a)(3) is in the borrower's interest is based on the totality of the circumstances, at the time the credit is extended. A written statement by the borrower that ``this loan is in my interest'' alone does not meet this standard.</p><p class="depth0">i. A refinancing would be in the borrower's interest if needed to meet the borrower's ``bona fide personal financial emergency'' (see generally Sec. 226.23(e) and Sec. 226.31(c)(1)(iii)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. In connection with a refinancing that provides additional funds to the borrower, in determining whether a loan is in the borrower's interest consideration should be given to whether the loan fees and charges are commensurate with the amount of new funds advanced, and whether the real estate-related charges are bona fide and reasonable in amount (see generally Sec. 226.4(c)(7)).</p><p class="depth0">2. Application of the one-year refinancing prohibition to creditors and assignees. The prohibition in Sec. 226.34(a)(3) applies where an extension of credit subject to Sec. 226.32 is refinanced into another loan subject to Sec. 226.32. The prohibition is illustrated by the following examples. Assume that Creditor A makes a loan subject to Sec. 226.32 on January 15, 2003, secured by a first lien; this loan is assigned to Creditor B on February 15, 2003:</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditor A is prohibited from refinancing the January 2003 loan (or any other loan subject to Sec. 226.32 to the same borrower) into a loan subject to Sec. 226.32, until January 15, 2004. Creditor B is restricted until January 15, 2004, or such date prior to January 15, 2004 that Creditor B ceases to hold or service the loan. During the prohibition period, Creditors A and B may make a subordinate lien loan that does not refinance a loan subject to Sec. 226.32. Assume that on April 1, 2003, Creditor A makes but does not assign a second-lien loan subject to Sec. 226.32. In that case, Creditor A would be prohibited from refinancing either the first-lien or second-lien loans (or any other loans to that borrower subject to Sec. 226.32) into another loan subject to Sec. 226.32 until April 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The loan made by Creditor A on January 15, 2003 (and assigned to Creditor B) may be refinanced by Creditor C at any time. If Creditor C refinances this loan on March 1, 2003 into a new loan subject to Sec. 226.32, Creditor A is prohibited from refinancing the loan made by Creditor C (or any other loan subject to Sec. 226.32 to the same borrower) into another loan subject to Sec. 226.32 until January 15, 2004. Creditor C is similarly prohibited from refinancing any loan subject to Sec. 226.32

to that borrower into another until March 1, 2004. (The limitations of Sec. 226.34(a)(3) no longer apply to Creditor B after Creditor C refinanced the January 2003 loan and Creditor B ceased to hold or service the loan.)</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4) Repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Application of repayment ability rule. The Sec. 226.34(a)(4) prohibition against making loans without regard to consumers' repayment ability applies to mortgage loans described in Sec. 226.32(a). In addition, the Sec. 226.34(a)(4) prohibition applies to higher-priced mortgage loans described in Sec. 226.35(a). See 12 CFR 226.35(b)(1). For guidance on the application of the Board's revisions to Sec. 226.34(a)(4) published on July 30, 2008, see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. General prohibition. Section 226.34(a)(4) prohibits a creditor from extending credit subject to Sec. 226.32 to a consumer based on the value of the consumer's collateral without regard to the consumer's repayment ability as of consummation, including the consumer's current and reasonably expected income, employment, assets other than the collateral, current obligations, and property tax and insurance obligations. A creditor may base its determination of repayment ability on current or reasonably expected income from employment or other sources, on assets other than the collateral, or both.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other dwelling-secured obligations. For purposes of Sec. 226.34(a)(4), current obligations include another credit obligation of which the creditor has knowledge undertaken prior to or at consummation of the transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the transaction subject to Sec. 226.32 or Sec. 226.35. For example, where a transaction subject to Sec. 226.35 is a first-lien transaction for the purchase of a home, a creditor must consider a ``piggyback'' second-lien transaction of which it has knowledge that is used to finance part of the down payment on the house.</p><p class="depth0">4. Discounted introductory rates and non-amortizing or negatively-amortizing payments. A credit agreement may determine a consumer's initial payments using a temporarily discounted interest rate or permit the consumer to make initial payments that are non-amortizing or negatively amortizing. (Negative amortization is permissible for loans covered by Sec. 226.35(a), but not Sec. 226.32). In such cases the creditor may determine repayment ability using the assumptions provided in Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">5. Repayment ability as of consummation. Section 226.34(a)(4) prohibits a creditor from disregarding repayment ability based on the facts and circumstances known to the creditor as of consummation. In general, a creditor does not violate this provision if a consumer defaults because of a significant reduction in income (for example, a job loss) or a significant obligation (for example, an obligation arising from a major medical expense) that occurs after consummation. However, if a creditor has knowledge as of consummation of reductions in income, for example, if a consumer's written application states that the consumer plans to retire within twelve months without obtaining new employment, or states that the consumer will transition from full-time to part-time employment, the creditor must consider that information.</p><p class="depth0">6. Income, assets, and employment. Any current or reasonably expected assets or income may be considered by the creditor, except the collateral itself. For example, a creditor may use information about current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions. Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military, or self-employment. Other sources of income could include interest or dividends; retirement benefits; public assistance; and alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. A creditor may also take into account assets such as savings accounts or investments that the consumer can or will be able to use.</p><p class="depth0">7. Interaction with Regulation B. Section 226.34(a)(4) does not require or permit the creditor to make inquiries or verifications that would be prohibited by Regulation B, 12 CFR part 202.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(i) Mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage-related obligations. A creditor must include in its repayment ability analysis the expected property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor as set forth in Sec. 226.35(b)(3)(i), as well as similar mortgage-related expenses. Similar mortgage-related expenses include homeowners' association dues and condominium or cooperative fees.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(ii) Verification of repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Income and assets relied on. A creditor must verify the income and assets the creditor relies on to evaluate the consumer's repayment ability. For example, if a consumer earns a salary and also states that he or she is paid an annual bonus, but the creditor only relies on the applicant's salary to evaluate repayment ability, the creditor need only verify the salary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Income and assets--co-applicant. If two persons jointly apply for credit and both list income or assets on the application, the creditor must verify repayment ability with respect to both applicants unless the creditor relies only on the income or assets of one of the applicants in determining repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">3. Expected income. If a creditor relies on expected income, the expectation must be reasonable and it must be verified with third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's expected income. For example, if the creditor relies on an expectation that a consumer will receive an annual bonus, the creditor may

verify the basis for that expectation with documents that show the consumer's past annual bonuses and the expected bonus must bear a reasonable relationship to past bonuses. Similarly, if the creditor relies on a consumer's expected salary following the consumer's receipt of an educational degree, the creditor may verify that expectation with a written statement from an employer indicating that the consumer will be employed upon graduation at a specified salary.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2. A creditor may verify a consumer's income using a consumer's IRS Form W-2 (or any subsequent revisions or similar IRS Forms used for reporting wages and tax withholding). The creditor may also use an electronic retrieval service for obtaining the consumer's W-2 information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Tax returns. A creditor may verify a consumer's income or assets using the consumer's tax return. A creditor may also use IRS Form 4506 ``Request for Copy of Tax Return,'' Form 4506-T ``Request for Transcript of Tax Return,'' or Form 8821 ``Tax Information Authorization'' (or any subsequent revisions or similar IRS Forms appropriate for obtaining tax return information directly from the IRS) to verify the consumer's income or assets. The creditor may also use an electronic retrieval service for obtaining tax return information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of consumer's income or assets. Creditors may verify income and assets using documents produced by third parties. Creditors may not rely on information provided orally by third parties, but may rely on correspondence from the third party, such as by letter or e-mail. The creditor may rely on any third-party document that provides reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. For example, creditors may verify the consumer's income using receipts from a check-cashing or remittance service, or by obtaining a written statement from the consumer's employer that states the consumer's income.</p><p class="depth0">4. Information specific to the consumer. Creditors must verify a consumer's income or assets using information that is specific to the individual consumer. Creditors may use third-party databases that contain individual-specific data about a consumer's income or assets, such as a third-party database service used by the consumer's employer for the purpose of centralizing income verification requests, so long as the information is reasonably current and accurate. Information about average incomes for the consumer's occupation in the consumer's geographic location or information about average incomes paid by the consumer's employer, however, would not be specific to the individual consumer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Duplicative collection of documentation. A creditor that has made a loan to a consumer and is refinancing or extending new credit to the same consumer need not collect from the consumer a document the creditor previously obtained if the creditor has no information that would reasonably lead the creditor to believe that document has changed since it was initially collected. For example, if the creditor has obtained the consumer's 2006 tax return to make a home purchase loan in May 2007, the creditor may rely on the 2006 tax return if the creditor makes a home equity loan to the same consumer in August 2007. Similarly, if the creditor has obtained the consumer's bank statement for May 2007 in making the first loan, the creditor may rely on that bank statement for that month in making the subsequent loan in August 2007.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. No violation if income or assets relied on not materially greater than verifiable amounts. A creditor that does not verify income or assets used to determine repayment ability with reasonably reliable third-party documents does not violate Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(ii) if the creditor demonstrates that the income or assets it relied upon were not materially greater than the amounts that the creditor would have been able to verify pursuant to Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(ii). For example, if a creditor determines a consumer's repayment ability by relying on the consumer's annual income of $40,000 but fails to obtain documentation of that amount before extending the credit, the creditor will not have violated this section if the creditor later obtains evidence that would satisfy Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(ii)(A), such as tax return information, showing that the creditor could have documented, at the time the loan was consummated, that the consumer had an annual income not materially less than $40,000.</p><p class="depth0">2. Materially greater than. Amounts of income or assets relied on are not materially greater than amounts that could have been verified at consummation if relying on the verifiable amounts would not have altered a reasonable creditor's decision to extend credit or the terms of the credit.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A credit report may be used to verify current obligations. A credit report, however, might not reflect an obligation that a consumer has listed on an application. The creditor is responsible for considering such an obligation, but the creditor is not required to independently verify the obligation. Similarly, a creditor is responsible for considering certain obligations undertaken just before or at consummation of the transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the transaction (for example, a ``piggy back'' loan), of which the creditor knows, even if not reflected on a credit report. See comment 34(a)(4)-3.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(iii) Presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor is presumed to have complied with Sec. 226.34(a)(4) if the creditor follows the three underwriting procedures specified in paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii) for verifying repayment ability, determining the payment obligation, and measuring the relationship of obligations to income. The procedures for verifying repayment ability are required under paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii); the other procedures are not required but, if followed along with the required procedures, create a presumption that the creditor has complied with Sec. 226.34(a)(4). The consumer may rebut the presumption with evidence that the creditor nonetheless disregarded repayment ability despite following these procedures. For example, evidence of a very high debt-to-income ratio and a very limited residual income could be sufficient to rebut the presumption, depending on all of the facts and circumstances. If a creditor fails to follow one of the non-required procedures set forth in paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii), then the creditor's compliance is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances without there being a presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of payment schedule. To retain a presumption of compliance under Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(iii), a creditor must determine the consumer's ability to pay the principal and interest obligation based on the maximum scheduled payment in the first seven years following consummation. In general, a creditor should determine a payment schedule for purposes of Sec. 226.34(a)(4)(iii)(B) based on the guidance in the staff commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)(1). Examples of how to determine the maximum scheduled payment in the first seven years are provided as follows (all payment amounts are rounded):</p><p class="depth0">i. Balloon-payment loan; fixed interest rate. A loan in an amount of $100,000 with a fixed interest rate of 8.0 percent (no points) has a 7-year term but is amortized over 30 years. The monthly payment scheduled for 7 years is $733 with a balloon payment of remaining principal due at the end of 7 years. The creditor will retain the presumption of compliance if it assesses repayment ability based on the payment of $733.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fixed-rate loan with interest-only payment for five years. A loan in an amount of $100,000 with a fixed interest rate of 8.0 percent (no points) has a 30-year term. The monthly payment of $667 scheduled for the first 5 years would cover only the interest due. After the fifth year, the scheduled payment would increase to $772, an amount that fully amortizes the principal balance over the remaining 25 years. The creditor will retain the presumption of compliance if it assesses repayment ability based on the payment of $772.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Fixed-rate loan with interest-only payment for seven years. A loan in an amount of $100,000 with a fixed interest rate of 8.0 percent (no points) has a 30-year term. The monthly payment of $667 scheduled for the first 7 years would cover only the interest due. After the seventh year, the scheduled payment would increase to $793, an amount that fully amortizes the principal balance over the remaining 23 years. The creditor will retain the presumption of compliance if it assesses repayment ability based on the interest-only payment of $667.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Variable-rate loan with discount for five years. A loan in an amount of $100,000 has a 30-year term. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.0 percent for an initial period of 5 years. Accordingly, the payment scheduled for the first 5 years is $665. The agreement provides that, after 5 years, the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified index and margin. As of consummation, the sum of the index value and margin (the fully-indexed rate) is 8.0 percent. Accordingly, the payment scheduled for the remaining 25 years is $727. The creditor will retain the presumption of compliance if it assesses repayment ability based on the payment of $727.</p><p class="depth0">v. Variable-rate loan with discount for seven years. A loan in an amount of $100,000 has a 30-year term. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.125 percent for an initial period of 7 years. Accordingly, the payment scheduled for the first 7 years is $674. After 7 years, the agreement provides that the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified index and margin. As of consummation, the sum of the index value and margin (the fully-indexed rate) is 8.0 percent. Accordingly, the payment scheduled for the remaining years is $725. The creditor will retain the presumption of compliance if it assesses repayment ability based on the payment of $674.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Step-rate loan. A loan in an amount of $100,000 has a 30-year term. The agreement provides that the interest rate will be 5 percent for two years, 6 percent for three years, and 7 percent thereafter. Accordingly, the payment amounts are $537 for two years, $597 for three years, and $654 thereafter. To retain the presumption of compliance, the creditor must assess repayment ability based on the payment of $654.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Income'' and ``debt''. To determine whether to classify particular inflows or obligations as ``income'' or ``debt,'' creditors may look to widely accepted governmental and non-governmental underwriting standards, including, for example, those set forth in the Federal Housing Administration's handbook on Mortgage Credit Analysis for Mortgage Insurance on One- to Four-Unit Mortgage Loans.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(iv) Exclusions from the presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. The exclusions from the presumption of compliance should be interpreted consistent with staff comments 32(d)(1)(i)-1 and 32(d)(2)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Renewable balloon loan. If a creditor is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the consumer's control), the full term resulting from such renewal is the relevant term for purposes of the exclusion of certain balloon-payment loans. See comment 17(c)(1)-11 for a discussion of conditions within a consumer's control in connection with renewable balloon-payment loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(b) Prohibited acts or practices for dwelling-secured loans; open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of credit extended. Where a loan is documented as open-end credit but the features and terms or other circumstances demonstrate that it does not meet the definition of open-end credit, the loan is subject to the rules for closed-end credit, including Sec. 226.32 if the rate or fee trigger is met. In applying the triggers under Sec. 226.32, the ``amount financed,'' including the ``principal loan amount'' must be determined. In making the determination, the amount of credit that would have been extended if the loan had been documented as a closed-end loan is a factual determination to be made in each case. Factors to be considered include the amount of money the consumer originally requested, the amount of the first advance or the highest outstanding balance, or the amount of the credit line. The full amount of the credit line is considered only to the extent that it is reasonable to expect that the consumer might use the full amount of credit.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.35--Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection With Higher-</p><p class="depth0">priced Mortgage Loans</p><p class="depth0">35(a) Higher-priced mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. Average prime offer rates are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms currently offered to consumers by a representative sample of creditors for mortgage transactions that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime offer rates, the Board uses a survey of creditors that both meets the criteria of Sec. 226.35(a)(2) and provides pricing terms for at least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non-variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey [supreg].</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparable transaction. A higher-priced mortgage loan is a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by the specified margin. The table of average prime offer rates published by the Board indicates how to identify the comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate set. A transaction's annual percentage rate is compared to the average prime offer rate as of the date the transaction's interest rate is set (or ``locked'') before consummation. Sometimes a creditor sets the interest rate initially and then re-sets it at a different level before consummation. The creditor should use the last date the interest rate is set before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Board table. The Board publishes on the Internet, in table form, average prime offer rates for a wide variety of transaction types. The Board calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (see Sec. 226.22 and appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from a survey. The Board estimates annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which direct survey data are not available based on the loan pricing terms available in the survey and other information. The Board publishes on the Internet the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates.</p><p class="depth0">35(b) Rules for higher-priced mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Effective date. For guidance on the applicability of the rules in Sec. 226.35(b), see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment change. Section 226.35(b)(2) provides that a loan subject to this section may not have a penalty described by Sec. 226.32(d)(6) unless certain conditions are met. Section 226.35(b)(2)(ii)(C) lists as a condition that the amount of the periodic payment of principal or interest or both may not change during the four-year period following consummation. For examples showing whether a prepayment penalty is permitted or prohibited in connection with particular payment changes, see comment 32(d)(7)(iv)-1. Those examples, however, include a condition that Sec. 226.35(b)(2) does not include: the condition that, at consummation, the consumer's total monthly debt payments may not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's monthly gross income. For guidance about circumstances in which payment changes are not considered payment changes for purposes of this section, see comment 32(d)(7)(iv)-2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization. Section 226.32(d)(2) provides that a loan described in Sec. 226.32(a) may not have a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that cause the principal balance to increase. Therefore, the

commentary to Sec. 226.32(d)(7)(iv) does not include examples of payment changes in connection with negative amortization. The following examples show whether, under Sec. 226.35(b)(2), prepayment penalties are permitted or prohibited in connection with particular payment changes, when a loan agreement permits negative amortization:</p><p class="depth0">i. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month and the loan agreement permits negative amortization to occur. Under the loan agreement, the first date that a scheduled payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014 and the creditor does not have the right to change scheduled payments prior to that date even if negative amortization occurs. A prepayment penalty is permitted with this mortgage transaction provided that the other Sec. 226.35(b)(2) conditions are met, that is: provided that the prepayment penalty is permitted by other applicable law, the penalty expires on or before December 31, 2011, and the penalty will not apply if the source of the prepayment funds is a refinancing by the creditor or its affiliate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month and the loan agreement permits negative amortization to occur. Under the loan agreement, the first date that a scheduled payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014, but the creditor has the right to change scheduled payments prior to that date if negative amortization occurs. A prepayment penalty is prohibited with this mortgage transaction because the payment may change within the four-year period following consummation.</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(3) Escrows.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Section 226.35(b)(3) applies to principal dwellings, including structures that are classified as personal property under state law. For example, an escrow account must be established on a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a first-lien on a mobile home, boat or a trailer used as the consumer's principal dwelling. See the commentary under Sec. Sec. 226.2(a)(19), 226.2(a)(24), 226.15 and 226.23. Section 226.35(b)(3) also applies to higher-priced mortgage loans secured by a first lien on a condominium or a cooperative unit if it is in fact used as principal residence.</p><p class="depth0">2. Administration of escrow accounts. Section 226.35(b)(3) requires creditors to establish before the consummation of a loan secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling an escrow account for payment of property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by creditor. Section 6 of RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605, and Regulation X address how escrow accounts must be administered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Optional insurance items. Section 226.35(b)(3) does not require that escrow accounts be established for premiums for mortgage-related insurance that the creditor does not require in connection with the credit transaction, such as an earthquake insurance or debt-protection insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(3)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Limited exception. A creditor is required to escrow for payment of property taxes for all first lien loans secured by condominium units regardless of whether the creditors escrows insurance premiums for condominium unit.</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(3)(v) ``Jumbo'' loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Special threshold for ``jumbo'' loans. For purposes of the escrow requirement in Sec. 226.35(b)(3) only, the coverage threshold stated in Sec. 226.35(a)(1) for first-lien loans (1.5 or more percentage points greater than the average prime offer rate) does not apply to a loan with a principal obligation that exceeds the limit in effect as of the date the loan's rate is set for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac (``jumbo'' loans). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) establishes and adjusts the maximum principal obligation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2) and other provisions of federal law. Adjustments to the maximum principal obligation made by FHFA apply in determining whether a mortgage loan is a ``jumbo'' loan to which the separate coverage threshold in Sec. 226.35(b)(3)(v) applies.</p><p class="depth0">2. Escrow requirements only. Under Sec. 226.35(b)(3)(v), for ``jumbo'' loans, the annual percentage rate threshold is 2.5 or more percentage points greater than the average prime offer rate. This threshold applies solely in determining whether a ``jumbo'' loan is subject to the escrow requirement of Sec. 226.35(b)(3). The determination of whether ``jumbo'' first-lien loans are subject to the other protections in Sec. 226.35, such as the ability to repay requirements under Sec. 226.35(b)(1) and the restrictions on prepayment penalties under Sec. 226.35(b)(2), is based on the 1.5 percentage point threshold stated in Sec. 226.35(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.36--Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection with Credit</p><p class="depth0">Secured by a Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of coverage. Sections 226.36(b) and (c) apply to closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Sections 226.36(d) and (e) apply to closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling. Sections 226.36(d) and (e) apply to closed-end loans secured by first or subordinate liens, and reverse mortgages that are not home-equity lines of credit under Sec. 226.5b.

Sec. 226.36(d) and (e). The final rules on loan originator

compensation in Sec. 226.36 apply to transactions for which the creditor receives an application on or after the effective date. For example, assume a mortgage broker takes an application on March 10, 2011, which the creditor receives on March 25, 2011. This transaction is not covered. If, however, the creditor does not receive the application until April 8, 2011, the transaction is covered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Effective date. For guidance on the applicability of the rules in Sec. 226.36, see comment 1(d)(5)-1.</p><p class="depth0">36(a) Loan originator and mortgage broker defined.</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning of loan originator. i. General. Section 226.36(a) provides that a loan originator is any person who for compensation or other monetary gain arranges, negotiates, or otherwise obtains an extension of consumer credit for another person. Thus, the term ``loan originator'' includes employees of a creditor as well as employees of a mortgage broker that satisfy this definition. In addition, the definition of loan originator expressly includes any creditor that satisfies the definition of loan originator but makes use of ``table funding'' by a third party. See comment 36(a)-1.ii below discussing table funding. Although consumers may sometimes arrange, negotiate, or otherwise obtain extensions of consumer credit on their own behalf, in such cases they do not do so for another person or for compensation or other monetary gain, and therefore are not loan originators under this section. (Under Sec. 226.2(a)(22), the term ``person'' means a natural person or an organization.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Table funding. Table funding occurs when the creditor does not provide the funds for the transaction at consummation out of the creditor's own resources, including drawing on a bona fide warehouse line of credit, or out of deposits held by the creditor. Accordingly, a table-funded transaction is consummated with the debt obligation initially payable by its terms to one person, but another person provides the funds for the transaction at consummation and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other evidence of the debt obligation. Although Sec. 226.2(a)(17)(i)(B) provides that a person to whom a debt obligation is initially payable on its face generally is a creditor, Sec. 226.36(a)(1) provides that, solely for the purposes of Sec. 226.36, such a person is also considered a loan originator. The creditor is not considered a loan originator unless table funding occurs. For example, if a person closes a loan in its own name but does not fund the loan from its own resources or deposits held by it because it assigns the loan at consummation, it is considered a creditor for purposes of Regulation Z and also a loan originator for purposes of Sec. 226.36. However, if a person closes a loan in its own name and draws on a bona fide warehouse line of credit to make the loan at consummation, it is considered a creditor, not a loan originator, for purposes of Regulation Z, including Sec. 226.36.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Servicing. The definition of ``loan originator'' does not apply to a loan servicer when the servicer modifies an existing loan on behalf of the current owner of the loan. The rule only applies to extensions of consumer credit and does not apply if a modification of an existing obligation's terms does not constitute a refinancing under Sec. 226.20(a).</p><p class="depth0">2. Meaning of mortgage broker. For purposes of Sec. 226.36, with respect to a particular transaction, the term ``mortgage broker'' refers to a loan originator who is not an employee of the creditor. Accordingly, the term ``mortgage broker'' includes companies that engage in the activities described in Sec. 226.36(a) and also includes employees of such companies that engage in these activities. Section 226.36(d) prohibits certain payments to a loan originator. These prohibitions apply to payments made to all loan originators, including payments made to mortgage brokers, and payments made by a company acting as a mortgage broker to its employees who are loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">3. Meaning of creditor. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e), a creditor means a creditor that is not deemed to be a loan originator on the transaction under this section. Thus, a person that closes a loan in its own name (but another person provides the funds for the transaction at consummation and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other evidence of the debt obligation) is deemed a loan originator, not a creditor, for purposes of Sec. 226.36. However, that person is still a creditor for all other purposes of Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">4. Managers and administrative staff. For purposes of Sec. 226.36, managers, administrative staff, and similar individuals who are employed by a creditor or loan originator but do not arrange, negotiate, or otherwise obtain an extension of credit for a consumer, and whose compensation is not based on whether any particular loan is originated, are not loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">36(c) Servicing practices.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting of payments. Under Sec. 226.36(c)(1)(i), a mortgage servicer must credit a payment to a consumer's loan account as of the date of receipt. This does not require that a mortgage servicer post the payment to the consumer's loan account on a particular date; the servicer is only required to credit the payment as of the date of receipt. Accordingly, a servicer that receives a payment on or before its due date (or within any grace period), and does not enter the payment on its books or in its system until after the payment's due date (or expiration of any grace period), does not violate this rule as long as the entry does not result in

the imposition of a late charge, additional interest, or similar penalty to the consumer, or in the reporting of negative information to a consumer reporting agency.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payments to be credited. Payments should be credited based on the legal obligation between the creditor and consumer. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date of receipt. The ``date of receipt'' is the date that the payment instrument or other means of payment reaches the mortgage servicer. For example, payment by check is received when the mortgage servicer receives it, not when the funds are collected. If the consumer elects to have payment made by a third-party payor such as a financial institution, through a preauthorized payment or telephone bill-payment arrangement, payment is received when the mortgage servicer receives the third-party payor's check or other transfer medium, such as an electronic fund transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Pyramiding of late fees. The prohibition on pyramiding of late fees in this subsection should be construed consistently with the ``credit practices rule'' of Regulation AA, 12 CFR 227.15.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable time. The payoff statement must be provided to the consumer, or person acting on behalf of the consumer, within a reasonable time after the request. For example, it would be reasonable under most circumstances to provide the statement within five business days of receipt of a consumer's request. This time frame might be longer, for example, when the servicer is experiencing an unusually high volume of refinancing requests.</p><p class="depth0">2. Person acting on behalf of the consumer. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(c)(1)(iii), a person acting on behalf of the consumer may include the consumer's representative, such as an attorney representing the individual, a non-profit consumer counseling or similar organization, or a creditor with which the consumer is refinancing and which requires the payoff statement to complete the refinancing. A servicer may take reasonable measures to verify the identity of any person acting on behalf of the consumer and to obtain the consumer's authorization to release information to any such person before the ``reasonable time'' period begins to run.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment requirements. The servicer may specify reasonable requirements for making payoff requests, such as requiring requests to be in writing and directed to a mailing address, e-mail address or fax number specified by the servicer or orally to a telephone number specified by the servicer, or any other reasonable requirement or method. If the consumer does not follow these requirements, a longer time frame for responding to the request would be reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">4. Accuracy of payoff statements. Payoff statements must be accurate when issued.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment requirements. The servicer may specify reasonable requirements for making payments in writing, such as requiring that payments be accompanied by the account number or payment coupon; setting a cut-off hour for payment to be received, or setting different hours for payment by mail and payments made in person; specifying that only checks or money orders should be sent by mail; specifying that payment is to be made in U.S. dollars; or specifying one particular address for receiving payments, such as a post office box. The servicer may be prohibited, however, from requiring payment solely by preauthorized electronic fund transfer. (See section 913 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693k.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment requirements--limitations. Requirements for making payments must be reasonable; it should not be difficult for most consumers to make conforming payments. For example, it would be reasonable to require a cut-off time of 5 p.m. for receipt of a mailed check at the location specified by the servicer for receipt of such check.</p><p class="depth0">3. Implied guidelines for payments. In the absence of specified requirements for making payments, payments may be made at any location where the servicer conducts business; any time during the servicer's normal business hours; and by cash, money order, draft, or other similar instrument in properly negotiable form, or by electronic fund transfer if the servicer and consumer have so agreed.</p><p class="depth0">36(d) Prohibited payments to loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">1. Persons covered. Section 226.36(d) prohibits any person (including the creditor) from paying compensation to a loan originator in connection with a covered credit transaction, if the amount of the payment is based on any of the transaction's terms or conditions. For example, a person that purchases a loan from the creditor may not compensate the loan originator in a manner that violates Sec. 226.36(d).</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage brokers. The payments made by a company acting as a mortgage broker to its employees who are loan originators are subject to the section's prohibitions. For example, a mortgage broker may not pay its employee more for a transaction with a 7 percent interest rate than for a transaction with a 6 percent interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(1) Payments based on transaction terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation. i. General. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e), the term ``compensation'' includes salaries, commissions, and any financial or similar incentive provided to a loan originator that is based on any of the terms or conditions of the loan originator's transactions. See comment 36(d)(1)-3 for examples of types of compensation that are not

covered by Sec. 226.36(d) and (e). For example, the term ``compensation'' includes</p><p class="depth0">A. An annual or other periodic bonus; or</p><p class="depth0">B. Awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Name of fee. Compensation includes amounts the loan originator retains and is not dependent on the label or name of any fee imposed in connection with the transaction. For example, if a loan originator imposes a ``processing fee'' in connection with the transaction and retains such fee, it is deemed compensation for purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e), whether the originator expends the time to process the consumer's application or uses the fee for other expenses, such as overhead.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amounts for third-party charges. Compensation includes amounts the loan originator retains, but does not include amounts the originator receives as payment for bona fide and reasonable third-party charges, such as title insurance or appraisals. In some cases, amounts received for payment for third-party charges may exceed the actual charge because, for example, the originator cannot determine with accuracy what the actual charge will be before consummation. In such a case, the difference retained by the originator is not deemed compensation if the third-party charge imposed on the consumer was bona fide and reasonable, and also complies with state and other applicable law. On the other hand, if the originator marks up a third-party charge (a practice known as ``upcharging''), and the originator retains the difference between the actual charge and the marked-up charge, the amount retained is compensation for purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e). For example</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume a loan originator charges the consumer a $400 application fee that includes $50 for a credit report and $350 for an appraisal. Assume that $50 is the amount the creditor pays for the credit report. At the time the loan originator imposes the application fee on the consumer, the loan originator is uncertain of the cost of the appraisal because the originator may choose from appraisers that charge between $300 to $350 for appraisals. Later, the cost for the appraisal is determined to be $300 for this consumer's transaction. In this case, the $50 difference between the $400 application fee imposed on the consumer and the actual $350 cost for the credit report and appraisal is not deemed compensation for purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e), even though the $50 is retained by the loan originator.</p><p class="depth0">B. Using the same example in comment 36(d)(1)-1.iii.A above, the $50 difference would be compensation for purposes of Sec. 226.36(d) and (e) if the appraisers from whom the originator chooses charge fees between $250 and $300.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of compensation that is based on transaction terms or conditions. Section 226.36(d)(1) prohibits loan originator compensation that is based on the terms or conditions of the loan originator's transactions. For example, the rule prohibits compensation to a loan originator for a transaction based on that transaction's interest rate, annual percentage rate, loan-to-value ratio, or the existence of a prepayment penalty. The rule also prohibits compensation based on a factor that is a proxy for a transaction's terms or conditions. For example, a consumer's credit score or similar representation of credit risk, such as the consumer's debt-to-income ratio, is not one of the transaction's terms or conditions. However, if a loan originator's compensation varies in whole or in part with a factor that serves as a proxy for loan terms or conditions, then the originator's compensation is based on a transaction's terms or conditions. To illustrate, assume that consumer A and consumer B receive loans from the same loan originator and the same creditor. Consumer A has a credit score of 650, and consumer B has a credit score of 800. Consumer A's loan has a 7 percent interest rate, and consumer B's loan has a 6\1/2\ percent interest rate because of the consumers' different credit scores. If the creditor pays the loan originator $1,500 in compensation for consumer A's loan and $1,000 in compensation for consumer B's loan because the creditor varies compensation payments in whole or in part with a consumer's credit score, the originator's compensation would be based on the transactions' terms or conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of compensation not based on transaction terms or conditions. The following are only illustrative examples of compensation methods that are permissible (unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law), and not an exhaustive list. Compensation is not based on the transaction's terms or conditions if it is based on, for example</p><p class="depth0">i. The loan originator's overall loan volume (i.e., total dollar amount of credit extended or total number of loans originated), delivered to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The long-term performance of the originator's loans.</p><p class="depth0">iii. An hourly rate of pay to compensate the originator for the actual number of hours worked.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Whether the consumer is an existing customer of the creditor or a new customer.</p><p class="depth0">v. A payment that is fixed in advance for every loan the originator arranges for the creditor (e.g., $600 for every loan arranged for the creditor, or $1,000 for the first 1,000 loans arranged and $500 for each additional loan arranged).</p><p class="depth0">vi. The percentage of applications submitted by the loan originator to the creditor that result in consummated transactions.</p><p class="depth0">vii. The quality of the loan originator's loan files (e.g., accuracy and completeness of

the loan documentation) submitted to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">viii. A legitimate business expense, such as fixed overhead costs.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Compensation that is based on the amount of credit extended, as permitted by Sec. 226.36(d)(1)(ii). See comment 36(d)(1)-9 discussing compensation based on the amount of credit extended.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor's flexibility in setting loan terms. Section 226.36(d)(1) does not limit a creditor's ability to offer a higher interest rate in a transaction as a means for the consumer to finance the payment of the loan originator's compensation or other costs that the consumer would otherwise be required to pay directly (either in cash or out of the loan proceeds). Thus, a creditor may charge a higher interest rate to a consumer who will pay fewer of the costs of the transaction directly, or it may offer the consumer a lower rate if the consumer pays more of the costs directly. For example, if the consumer pays half of the transaction costs directly, a creditor may charge an interest rate of 6 percent but, if the consumer pays none of the transaction costs directly, the creditor may charge an interest rate of 6.5 percent. Section 226.36(d)(1) also does not limit a creditor from offering or providing different loan terms to the consumer based on the creditor's assessment of the credit and other transactional risks involved. A creditor could also offer different consumers varying interest rates that include a constant interest rate premium to recoup the loan originator's compensation through increased interest paid by the consumer (such as by adding a constant 0.25 percent to the interest rate on each loan).</p><p class="depth0">5. Effect of modification of loan terms. Under Sec. 226.36(d)(1), a loan originator's compensation may not vary based on any of a credit transaction's terms or conditions. Thus, a creditor and originator may not agree to set the originator's compensation at a certain level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as where the consumer is able to obtain a lower rate from another creditor). When the creditor offers to extend a loan with specified terms and conditions (such as the rate and points), the amount of the originator's compensation for that transaction is not subject to change (increase or decrease) based on whether different loan terms are negotiated. For example, if the creditor agrees to lower the rate that was initially offered, the new offer may not be accompanied by a reduction in the loan originator's compensation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Periodic changes in loan originator compensation and transactions' terms and conditions. This section does not limit a creditor or other person from periodically revising the compensation it agrees to pay a loan originator. However, the revised compensation arrangement must result in payments to the loan originator that do not vary based on the terms or conditions of a credit transaction. A creditor or other person might periodically review factors such as loan performance, transaction volume, as well as current market conditions for originator compensation, and prospectively revise the compensation it agrees to pay to a loan originator. For example, assume that during the first 6 months of the year, a creditor pays $3,000 to a particular loan originator for each loan delivered, regardless of the loan terms or conditions. After considering the volume of business produced by that originator, the creditor could decide that as of July 1, it will pay $3,250 for each loan delivered by that particular originator, regardless of the loan terms or conditions. No violation occurs even if the loans made by the creditor after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, to reflect the higher compensation.</p><p class="depth0">7. Compensation received directly from the consumer. The prohibition in Sec. 226.36(d)(1) does not apply to transactions in which any loan originator receives compensation directly from the consumer, in which case no other person may provide any compensation to a loan originator, directly or indirectly, in connection with that particular transaction pursuant to Sec. 226.36(d)(2). Payments to a loan originator made out of loan proceeds are considered compensation received directly from the consumer, while payments derived from an increased interest rate are not considered compensation received directly from the consumer. However, points paid on the loan by the consumer to the creditor are not considered payments received directly from the consumer whether they are paid in cash or out of the loan proceeds. That is, if the consumer pays origination points to the creditor and the creditor compensates the loan originator, the loan originator may not also receive compensation directly from the consumer. Compensation includes amounts retained by the loan originator, but does not include amounts the loan originator receives as payment for bona fide and reasonable third-party charges, such as title insurance or appraisals. See comment 36(d)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">8. Record retention. See comment 25(a)-5 for guidance on complying with the record retention requirements of Sec. 226.25(a) as they apply to Sec. 226.36(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">9. Amount of credit extended. A loan originator's compensation may be based on the amount of credit extended, subject to certain conditions. Section 226.36(d)(1) does not prohibit an arrangement under which a loan originator is paid compensation based on a percentage of the amount of credit extended, provided the percentage is fixed and does not vary with the amount of credit extended. However, compensation that is based on a

fixed percentage of the amount of credit extended may be subject to a minimum and/or maximum dollar amount, as long as the minimum and maximum dollar amounts do not vary with each credit transaction. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor may offer a loan originator 1 percent of the amount of credit extended for all loans the originator arranges for the creditor, but not less than $1,000 or greater than $5,000 for each loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor may not offer a loan originator 1 percent of the amount of credit extended for loans of $300,000 or more, 2 percent of the amount of credit extended for loans between $200,000 and $300,000, and 3 percent of the amount of credit extended for loans of $200,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(2) Payments by persons other than consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation in connection with a particular transaction. Under Sec. 226.36(d)(2), if any loan originator receives compensation directly from a consumer in a transaction, no other person may provide any compensation to a loan originator, directly or indirectly, in connection with that particular credit transaction. See comment 36(d)(1)-7 discussing compensation received directly from the consumer. The restrictions imposed under Sec. 226.36(d)(2) relate only to payments, such as commissions, that are specific to, and paid solely in connection with, the transaction in which the consumer has paid compensation directly to a loan originator. Thus, payments by a mortgage broker company to an employee in the form of a salary or hourly wage, which is not tied to a specific transaction, do not violate Sec. 226.36(d)(2) even if the consumer directly pays a loan originator a fee in connection with a specific credit transaction. However, if any loan originator receives compensation directly from the consumer in connection with a specific credit transaction, neither the mortgage broker company nor an employee of the mortgage broker company can receive compensation from the creditor in connection with that particular credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Compensation received directly from a consumer. Under Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), a yield spread premium paid by a creditor to the loan originator may be characterized on the RESPA disclosures as a ``credit'' that will be applied to reduce the consumer's settlement charges, including origination fees. A yield spread premium disclosed in this manner is not considered to be received by the loan originator directly from the consumer for purposes of Sec. 226.36(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(3) Affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">1. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(d), affiliates are treated as a single ``person.'' The term ``affiliate'' is defined in Sec. 226.32(b)(2). For example, assume a parent company has two mortgage lending subsidiaries. Under Sec. 226.36(d)(1), subsidiary ``A'' could not pay a loan originator greater compensation for a loan with an interest rate of 8 percent than it would pay for a loan with an interest rate of 7 percent. If the loan originator may deliver loans to both subsidiaries, they must compensate the loan originator in the same manner. Accordingly, if the loan originator delivers the loan to subsidiary ``B'' and the interest rate is 8 percent, the originator must receive the same compensation that would have been paid by subsidiary A for a loan with a rate of either 7 or 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0">36(e) Prohibition on steering.</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation. See comment 36(d)(1)-1 for guidance on compensation that is subject to Sec. 226.36(e).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Steering. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(e), directing or ``steering'' a consumer to consummate a particular credit transaction means advising, counseling, or otherwise influencing a consumer to accept that transaction. For such actions to constitute steering, the consumer must actually consummate the transaction in question. Thus, Sec. 226.36(e)(1) does not address the actions of a loan originator if the consumer does not actually obtain a loan through that loan originator.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited conduct. Under Sec. 226.36(e)(1), a loan originator may not direct or steer a consumer to consummate a transaction based on the fact that the loan originator would increase the amount of compensation that the loan originator would receive for that transaction compared to other transactions, unless the consummated transaction is in the consumer's interest.</p><p class="depth0">i. In determining whether a consummated transaction is in the consumer's interest, that transaction must be compared to other possible loan offers available through the originator, if any, and for which the consumer was likely to qualify, at the time that transaction was offered to the consumer. Possible loan offers are available through the loan originator if they could be obtained from a creditor with which the loan originator regularly does business. Section 226.36(e)(1) does not require a loan originator to establish a business relationship with any creditor with which the loan originator does not already do business. To be considered a possible loan offer available through the loan originator, an offer need not be extended by the creditor; it need only be an offer that the creditor likely would extend upon receiving an application from the applicant, based on the creditor's current credit standards and its current rate sheets or other similar means of communicating its current credit terms to the loan originator. An originator need not inform the consumer

about a potential transaction if the originator makes a good faith determination that the consumer is not likely to qualify for it.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 226.36(e)(1) does not require a loan originator to direct a consumer to the transaction that will result in a creditor paying the least amount of compensation to the originator. However, if the loan originator reviews possible loan offers available from a significant number of the creditors with which the originator regularly does business, and the originator directs the consumer to the transaction that will result in the least amount of creditor-paid compensation for the loan originator, the requirements of Sec. 226.36(e)(1) are deemed to be satisfied. In the case where a loan originator directs the consumer to the transaction that will result in a greater amount of creditor-paid compensation for the loan originator, Sec. 226.36(e)(1) is not violated if the terms and conditions on that transaction compared to the other possible loan offers available through the originator, and for which the consumer likely qualifies, are the same. A loan originator who is an employee of the creditor on a transaction may not obtain compensation that is based on the transaction's terms or conditions pursuant to Sec. 226.36(d)(1), and compliance with that provision by such a loan originator also satisfies the requirements of Sec. 226.36(e)(1) for that transaction with the creditor. However, if a creditor's employee acts as a broker by forwarding a consumer's application to a creditor other than the loan originator's employer, such as when the employer does not offer any loan products for which the consumer would qualify, the loan originator is not an employee of the creditor in that transaction and is subject to Sec. 226.36(e)(1) if the originator is compensated for arranging the loan with the other creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. See the commentary under Sec. 226.36(e)(3) for additional guidance on what constitutes a ``significant number of creditors with which a loan originator regularly does business'' and guidance on the determination about transactions for which ``the consumer likely qualifies.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples. Assume a loan originator determines that a consumer likely qualifies for a loan from Creditor A that has a fixed interest rate of 7 percent, but the loan originator directs the consumer to a loan from Creditor B having a rate of 7.5 percent. If the loan originator receives more in compensation from Creditor B than the amount that would have been paid by Creditor A, the prohibition in Sec. 226.36(e) is violated unless the higher-rate loan is in the consumer's interest. For example, a higher-rate loan might be in the consumer's interest if the lower-rate loan has a prepayment penalty, or if the lower-rate loan requires the consumer to pay more in up-front charges that the consumer is unable or unwilling to pay or finance as part of the loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">36(e)(2) Permissible transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbors. A loan originator that satisfies Sec. 226.36(e)(2) is deemed to comply with Sec. 226.36(e)(1). A loan originator that does not satisfy Sec. 226.36(e)(2) is not subject to any presumption regarding the originator's compliance or noncompliance with Sec. 226.36(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum number of loan options. To obtain the safe harbor, Sec. 226.36(e)(2) requires that the loan originator present loan options that meet the criteria in Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(i) for each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest. As required by Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(ii), the loan originator must have a good faith belief that the options presented are loans for which the consumer likely qualifies. If the loan originator is not able to form such a good faith belief for loan options that meet the criteria in Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(i) for a given type of transaction, the loan originator may satisfy Sec. 226.36(e)(2) by presenting all loans for which the consumer likely qualifies and that meet the other requirements in Sec. 226.36(e)(3) for that given type of transaction. A loan originator may present to the consumer any number of loan options, but presenting a consumer more than four loan options for each type of transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest and for which the consumer likely qualifies would not likely help the consumer make a meaningful choice.</p><p class="depth0">36(e)(3) Loan options presented.</p><p class="depth0">1. Significant number of creditors. A significant number of the creditors with which a loan originator regularly does business is three or more of those creditors. If the loan originator regularly does business with fewer than three creditors, the originator is deemed to comply by obtaining loan options from all the creditors with which it regularly does business. Under Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(i), the loan originator must obtain loan options from a significant number of creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business, but the loan originator need not present loan options from all such creditors to the consumer. For example, if three loans available from one of the creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business satisfy the criteria in Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(i), presenting those and no options from any other creditor satisfies that section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditors with which loan originator regularly does business. To qualify for the safe harbor in Sec. 226.36(e)(2), the loan originator must obtain and review loan options from a significant number of the creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business. For this purpose, a loan originator regularly does business with a creditor if</p><p class="depth0">i. There is a written agreement between the originator and the creditor governing the

originator's submission of mortgage loan applications to the creditor;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor has extended credit secured by a dwelling to one or more consumers during the current or previous calendar month based on an application submitted by the loan originator; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor has extended credit secured by a dwelling twenty-five or more times during the previous twelve calendar months based on applications submitted by the loan originator. For this purpose, the previous twelve calendar months begin with the calendar month that precedes the month in which the loan originator accepted the consumer's application.</p><p class="depth0">3. Lowest interest rate. To qualify under the safe harbor in Sec. 226.36(e)(2), for each type of transaction in which the consumer has expressed an interest, the loan originator must present the consumer with loan options that meet the criteria in Sec. 226.36(e)(3)(i). The criteria are: The loan with the lowest interest rate; the loan with the lowest total dollar amount for discount points and origination points or fees; and a loan with the lowest interest rate without negative amortization, a prepayment penalty, a balloon payment in the first seven years of the loan term, shared equity, or shared appreciation, or, in the case of a reverse mortgage, a loan without a prepayment penalty, shared equity, or shared appreciation. To identify the loan with the lowest interest rate, for any loan that has an initial rate that is fixed for at least five years, the loan originator shall use the initial rate that would be in effect at consummation. For a loan with an initial rate that is not fixed for at least five years</p><p class="depth0">i. If the interest rate varies based on changes to an index, the originator shall use the fully-indexed rate that would be in effect at consummation without regard to any initial discount or premium.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For a step-rate loan, the originator shall use the highest rate that would apply during the first five years.</p><p class="depth0">4. Transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. To qualify under the safe harbor in Sec. 226.36(e)(2), the loan originator must have a good faith belief that the loan options presented to the consumer pursuant to Sec. 226.36(e)(3) are transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. The loan originator's belief that the consumer likely qualifies should be based on information reasonably available to the loan originator at the time the loan options are presented. In making this determination, the loan originator may rely on information provided by the consumer, even if it subsequently is determined to be inaccurate. For purposes of Sec. 226.36(e)(3), a loan originator is not expected to know all aspects of each creditor's underwriting criteria. But pricing or other information that is routinely communicated by creditors to loan originators is considered to be reasonably available to the loan originator, for example, rate sheets showing creditors' current pricing and the required minimum credit score or other eligibility criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.39--Mortgage transfer disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">39(a) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Covered persons. The disclosure requirements of this section apply to any ``covered person'' that becomes the legal owner of an existing mortgage loan, whether through a purchase, or other transfer or assignment, regardless of whether the person also meets the definition of a ``creditor'' in Regulation Z. The fact that a person purchases or acquires mortgage loans and provides the disclosures under this section does not by itself make that person a ``creditor'' as defined in the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Acquisition of legal title. To become a ``covered person'' subject to this section, a person must become the owner of an existing mortgage loan by acquiring legal title to the debt obligation.</p><p class="depth0">i. Partial interest. A person may become a covered person by acquiring a partial interest in the mortgage loan. If the original creditor transfers a partial interest in the loan to one or more persons, all such transferees are covered persons under this section.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Joint acquisitions. All persons that jointly acquire legal title to the loan are covered persons under this section, and under Sec. 226.39(b)(5), a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all such covered persons. Multiple persons are deemed to jointly acquire legal title to the loan if each acquires a partial interest in the loan pursuant to the same agreement or by otherwise acting in concert. See comments 39(b)(5)-1 and 39(d)(1)(ii)-1 regarding the disclosure requirements for multiple persons that jointly acquire a loan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Affiliates. An acquiring party that is a separate legal entity from the transferor must provide the disclosures required by this section even if the parties are affiliated entities.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exclusions.</p><p class="depth0">i. Beneficial interest. Section 226.39 does not apply to a party that acquires only a beneficial interest or a security interest in the loan, or to a party that assumes the credit risk without acquiring legal title to the loan. For example, an investor that acquires mortgage-backed securities, pass-through certificates, or participation interests and does not acquire legal title in the underlying mortgage loans is not covered by this section.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Loan servicers. Pursuant to TILA Section 131(f)(2), the servicer of a mortgage loan is not the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section if the servicer holds

title to the loan as a result of the assignment of the obligation to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mergers, corporate acquisitions, or reorganizations. Disclosures are required under this section when, as a result of a merger, corporate acquisition, or reorganization, the ownership of a mortgage loan is transferred to a different legal entity.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage transactions covered. Section 226.39 applies to closed-end or open-end consumer credit transactions secured by the principal dwelling of a consumer.</p><p class="depth0">39(b) Disclosure required.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. A covered person must mail or deliver the disclosures required by this section on or before the 30th calendar day following the date of transfer, unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. For example, if a covered person acquires a mortgage loan on March 15, the disclosure must be mailed or delivered on or before April 14.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(1) Form of disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">1. Combining disclosures. The disclosures under this section can be combined with other materials or disclosures, including the transfer of servicing notices required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) so long as the combined disclosure satisfies the timing and other requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(4) Multiple transfers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Single disclosure for multiple transfers. A mortgage loan might be acquired by a covered person and subsequently transferred to another entity that is also a covered person required to provide the disclosures under this section. In such cases, a single disclosure may be provided on behalf of both covered persons instead of providing two separate disclosures if the disclosure satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable to each covered person. For example, if a covered person acquires a loan on March 15 with the intent to assign the loan to another entity on April 30, the covered person could mail the disclosure on or before April 14 to provide the required information for both entities and indicate when the subsequent transfer is expected to occur.</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimating the date. When a covered person provides the disclosure required by this section that also describes a subsequent transfer, the date of the subsequent transfer may be estimated when the exact date is unknown at the time the disclosure is made. Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the covered person at the time the disclosure is made. The ``reasonably available'' standard requires that the covered person, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The covered person normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. The covered person might make the disclosure using an estimated date even though the covered person knows that more precise information will be available in the future. For example, a covered person may provide a disclosure on March 31 stating that it acquired the loan on March 15 and that a transfer to another entity is expected to occur ``on or around'' April 30, even if more precise information will be available by April 14.</p><p class="depth0">3. Duty to comply. Even though one covered person provides the disclosures for another covered person, each has a duty to ensure that disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and provided in a timely manner unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(5) Multiple covered person.</p><p class="depth0">1. Single disclosure required. If multiple covered persons jointly acquire the loan, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all covered persons instead of providing separate disclosures. See comment 39(a)(1)-2(ii) regarding a joint acquisition of legal title, and comment 39(d)(1)(ii)-1 regarding the disclosure requirements for multiple persons that jointly acquire a loan. If multiple covered persons jointly acquire the loan and complete the acquisition on separate dates, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all persons on or before the 30th day following the earliest acquisition date. For examples, if covered persons A and B enter into an agreement with the original creditor to jointly acquire the loan, and complete the acquisition on March 15 and March 25, respectively, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of both persons on or before April 14. If the two acquisition dates are more than 30 days apart, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of both persons on or before the 30th day following the earlier acquisition date, even though one person has not completed its acquisition. See comment 39(b)(4)-2 regarding use of an estimated date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Single disclosure not required. If multiple covered persons each acquire a partial interest in the loan pursuant to separate and unrelated agreements and not jointly, each covered person has a duty to ensure that disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and provided in a timely manner unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. The parties may, but are not required to, provide a single disclosure that satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable to each covered person.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing requirements. A single disclosure provided on behalf of multiple covered persons must satisfy the timing and content requirements applicable to each covered person unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">4. Duty to comply. Even though one covered person provides the disclosures for another covered person, each has a duty to ensure that disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and provided in a timely manner

unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. See comments 39(c)(1)-2, 39(c)(3)-1 and 39(c)(3)-2 regarding transfers of a partial interest in the mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth0">39(c) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Transfer of all interest. A covered person is not required to provide the disclosures required by this section if it sells, assigns or otherwise transfers all of its interest in the mortgage loan on or before the 30th calendar day following the date that it acquired the loan. For example, if covered person A acquires the loan on March 15 and subsequently transfers all of its interest in the loan to covered person B on April 1, person A is not required to provide the disclosures required by this section. Person B, however, must provide the disclosures required by this section unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">2. Transfer of partial interests. A covered person that subsequently transfers a partial interest in the loan is required to provide the disclosures required by this section if the covered person retains a partial interest in the loan on the 30th calendar day after it acquired the loan, unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. For example, if covered person A acquires the loan on March 15 and subsequently transfers fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person B on April 1, person A is required to provide the disclosures under this section if it retains a partial interest in the loan on April 14. Person B in this example must also provide the disclosures required under this section unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. Either person A or person B could provide the disclosure on behalf of both of them if the disclosure satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable to each of them. In this example, a single disclosure for both covered persons would have to be provided on or before April 14 to satisfy the timing requirements for person A's acquisition of the loan on March 15. See comment 39(b)(4)-1 regarding a single disclosure for multiple transfers.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Repurchase agreements. The original creditor or owner of the mortgage loan might sell, assign or otherwise transfer legal title to the loan to secure temporary business financing under an agreement that obligates the original creditor or owner to repurchase the loan. The covered person that acquires the loan in connection with such a repurchase agreement is not required to provide disclosures under this section. However, if the transferor does not repurchase the mortgage loan, the acquiring party must provide the disclosures required by this section within 30 days after the date that the transaction is recognized as an acquisition on its books and records.</p><p class="depth0">2. Intermediary parties. The exception in Sec. 226.39(c)(2) applies regardless of whether the repurchase arrangement involves an intermediary party. For example, legal title to the loan may transfer from the original creditor to party A through party B as an intermediary. If the original creditor is obligated to repurchase the loan, neither party A nor party B is required to provide the disclosures under this section. However, if the original creditor does not repurchase the loan, party A must provide the disclosures required by this section within 30 days after the date that the transaction is recognized as an acquisition on its books and records unless another exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Acquisition of partial interests. This exception applies if the covered person acquires only a partial interest in the loan, and there is no change in the agent or person authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments. If, as a result of the transfer of a partial interest in the loan, a different agent or party is authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments, the disclosures under this section must be provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. A covered person is not required to provide the disclosures under this section if it acquires a partial interest in the loan from the original creditor who remains authorized to receive the notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments after the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The original creditor transfers fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person A. Person A does not provide the disclosures under this section because the exception in Sec. 226.39(c)(3) applies. The creditor then transfers the remaining fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person B and does not retain any interest in the loan. Person B must provide the disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The original creditor transfers fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person A and also authorizes party X as its agent to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the loan. Since there is a change in an agent or party authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments, person A is required to provide the disclosures under this section. Person A then transfers all of its interest in the loan to covered person B. Person B is not required to provide the disclosures under this section if the original creditor retains a partial interest in the loan and party X retains the same authority.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The original creditor transfers all of its interest in the loan to covered person A. Person A provides the disclosures under this section and notifies the consumer that party X is authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the loan. Person A then transfers fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person B. Person B is not required to provide the disclosures under this section if person A retains a partial interest in the loan and party X retains the same authority.</p><p class="depth0">39(d) Content of required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Identifying the loan. The disclosures required by this section must identify the loan that was acquired or transferred. The covered person has flexibility in determining what information to provide for this purpose and may use any information that would reasonably inform a consumer which loan was acquired or transferred. For example, the covered person may identify the loan by stating</p><p class="depth0">i. The address of the mortgaged property along with the account number or loan number previously disclosed to the consumer, which may appear in a truncated format;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The account number alone, or other identifying number, if that number has been previously provided to the consumer, such as on a statement that the consumer receives monthly; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. The date on which the credit was extended and the original amount of the loan or credit line.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of covered person. Section 226.39(d)(1) requires a covered person to provide its name, address, and telephone number. The party identified must be the covered person who owns the mortgage loan, regardless of whether another party services the loan or is the covered person's agent. In addition to providing its name, address and telephone number, the covered person may, at its option, provide an address for receiving electronic mail or an internet Web site address, but is not required to do so.</p><p class="depth0">39(d)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple transfers, single disclosure. If a mortgage loan is acquired by a covered person and subsequently transferred to another covered person, a single disclosure may be provided on behalf of both covered persons instead of providing two separate disclosures as long as the disclosure satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable to each covered person. See comment 39(b)(4)-1 regarding multiple transfers. A single disclosure for multiple transfers must state the name, address, and telephone number of each covered person unless Sec. 226.39(d)(1)(ii) applies.</p><p class="depth0">39(d)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple covered persons, single disclosure. If multiple covered persons jointly acquire the loan, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all covered persons instead of providing separate disclosures. The single disclosure must provide the name, address, and telephone number of each covered person unless Sec. 226.39(d)(1)(ii) applies and one of the covered persons has been authorized in accordance with Sec. 226.39(d)(3) of this section to receive the consumer's notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the loan. In such cases, the information required by Sec. 226.39(d)(1) may be provided only for that covered person.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple covered persons, multiple disclosures. If multiple covered persons each acquire a partial interest in the loan in separate transactions and not jointly, each covered person must comply with the disclosure requirements of this section unless an exception in Sec. 226.39(c) applies. See comment 39(a)(1)-2(ii) regarding a joint acquisition of legal title, and comment 39(b)(5)-2 regarding the disclosure requirements for multiple covered persons.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Identifying agents. Under Sec. 226.39(d)(3), the covered person must provide the name, address and telephone number for the agent or other party having authority to receive the notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the loan. If multiple persons are identified under this paragraph, the disclosure shall provide the name, address and telephone number for each and indicate the extent to which the authority of each person differs. Section 226.39(d)(3) does not require that a covered person designate an agent or other party, but if the consumer cannot contact the covered person for these purposes, the disclosure must provide the name, address and telephone number for an agent or other party that can address these matters. If an agent or other party is authorized to receive the notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the loan, the disclosure can state that the consumer may contact that agent regarding any questions concerning the consumer's account without specifically mentioning rescission or payment issues. However, if multiple agents are listed on the disclosure, the disclosure shall state the extent to which the authority of each agent differs by indicating if only one of the agents is authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind, or only one of the agents is authorized to resolve issues concerning payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other contact information. The covered person may also provide an agent's electronic mail address or internet Web site address, but is not required to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Where recorded. Section 226.39(d)(4) requires the covered person to disclose where transfer of ownership of the debt to the covered person is recorded if it has been recorded in public records. Alternatively, the disclosure can state that the transfer of ownership of the debt has not been recorded in public records at the time the disclosure is provided, if that is the case, or the disclosure can state where the transfer may later be recorded. An exact address is not required and it would be sufficient, for example, to state that the transfer of ownership is recorded in the office of public land records or the recorder of deeds office for the county or local jurisdiction where the property is located.</p><p class="depth0">39(e) Optional disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. Section 226.39(e) provides that covered persons may, at their option, include additional information about the mortgage transaction that they consider relevant or helpful to consumers. For example, the covered person may choose to inform consumers that the location where they should send mortgage payments has not changed. See comment 39(b)(1)-1 regarding combined disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.42--Valuation Independence</p><p class="depth0">42(a) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">1. Open- and closed-end credit. Section 226.42 applies to both open-end and closed-end transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consumer's principal dwelling. Section 226.42 applies only if the dwelling that will secure a consumer credit transaction is the principal dwelling of the consumer who obtains credit.</p><p class="depth0">42(b) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of covered persons. ``Covered persons'' include creditors, mortgage brokers, appraisers, appraisal management companies, real estate agents, and other persons that provide ``settlement services'' as defined under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and implementing regulations. See 12 U.S.C. 2602(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of persons not covered. The following persons are not ``covered persons'' (unless, of course, they are creditors with respect to a covered transaction or perform ``settlement services'' in connection with a covered transaction)</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer who obtains credit through a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A person secondarily liable for a covered transaction, such as a guarantor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A person that resides in or will reside in the consumer's principal dwelling but will not be liable on the covered transaction, such as a non-obligor spouse.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Principal dwelling. The term ``principal dwelling'' has the same meaning under Sec. 226.42(b) as under Sec. Sec. 226.2(a)(24), 226.15(a), and 226.23(a). See comments 2(a)(24)-3, 15(a)-5, and 23(a)-3.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Valuation. A ``valuation'' is an estimate of value prepared by a natural person, such as an appraisal report prepared by an appraiser or an estimate of market value prepared by a real estate agent. The term includes photographic or other information included with a written estimate of value. A ``valuation'' includes an estimate provided or viewed electronically, such as an estimate transmitted via electronic mail or viewed using a computer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated model or system. A ``valuation'' does not include an estimate of value produced exclusively using an automated model or system. However, a ``valuation'' includes an estimate of value developed by a natural person based in part on an estimate of value produced using an automated model or system.</p><p class="depth0">3. Estimate. An estimate of the value of the consumer's principal dwelling includes an estimate of a range of values for the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">42(c) Valuation for consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(1) Coercion.</p><p class="depth0">1. State law. The terms ``coercion,'' ``extortion,'' ``inducement,'' ``bribery,'' ``intimidation,'' ``compensation,'' ``instruction,'' and ``collusion'' have the meanings given to them by applicable state law or contract. See Sec. 226.2(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Purpose. A covered person does not violate Sec. 226.42(c)(1) if the person does not engage in an act or practice set forth in Sec. 226.42(c)(1) for the purpose of causing the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the independent judgment of a person that prepares valuations. For example, requesting that a person that prepares a valuation take certain actions, such as consider additional, appropriate property information, does not violate Sec. 226.42(c), because such request does not supplant the independent judgment of the person that prepares a valuation. See Sec. 226.42(c)(3)(i). A covered person also may provide incentives, such as additional compensation, to a person that prepares valuations or performs valuation management functions under Sec. 226.42(c)(1), as long as the covered person does not cause or attempt to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the independent judgment of the person that prepares valuations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Person that prepares valuations. For purposes of Sec. 226.42, the term ``valuation'' includes an estimate of value regardless of whether it is an appraisal prepared by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser. See comment 42(b)(3)-1. A person that prepares

valuations may or may not be a state-licensed or state-certified appraiser. Thus a person violates Sec. 226.42(c)(1) by engaging in prohibited acts or practices directed towards any person that prepares or may prepare a valuation of the consumer's principal dwelling for a covered transaction. For example, a person violates Sec. 226.42(c)(1) by seeking to coerce a real estate agent to assign a value to the consumer's principal dwelling based on a factor other than the independent judgment of the real estate agent, in connection with a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Indirect acts or practices. Section 226.42(c)(1) prohibits both direct and indirect attempts to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the independent judgment of the person that prepares the valuation, through coercion and certain other acts and practices. For example, a creditor violates Sec. 226.42(c)(1) if the creditor attempts to cause the value an appraiser engaged by an appraisal management company assigns to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the appraiser's independent judgment, by threatening to withhold future business from a title company affiliated with the appraisal management company unless the appraiser assigns a value to the dwelling that meets or exceeds a minimum threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability of examples. Section 226.42(c)(1)(i) provides examples of coercion of a person that prepares valuations. However, Sec. 226.42(c)(1)(i) also applies to coercion of a person that performs valuation management functions or its affiliate. See Sec. 226.42(c)(1); comment 42(c)(1)-4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific value or predetermined threshold. As used in the examples of actions prohibited under Sec. 226.42(c)(1), a ``specific value'' and a ``predetermined threshold'' include a predetermined minimum, maximum, or range of values. Further, although the examples assume a covered person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to equal or exceed a certain amount, the rule applies equally to cases where a covered person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the value assigned to the dwelling to be below a certain amount.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2) Mischaracterization of value.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2)(i) Misrepresentation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Opinion of value. Section 226.42(c)(2)(i) prohibits a person that performs valuations from misrepresenting the value of the consumer's principal dwelling in a valuation. Such person misrepresents the value of the consumer's principal dwelling by assigning a value to such dwelling that does not reflect the person's opinion of the value of such dwelling. For example, an appraiser misrepresents the value of the consumer's principal dwelling if the appraiser estimates that the value of such dwelling is $250,000 applying the standards required by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Standards but assigns a value of $300,000 to such dwelling in a Uniform Residential Appraisal Report.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2)(iii) Inducement of mischaracterization.</p><p class="depth0">1. Inducement. A covered person may not induce a person to materially misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling in a valuation or to falsify or alter a valuation. For example, a loan originator may not coerce a loan underwriter to alter an appraisal report to increase the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">42(d) Prohibition on conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(1)(i) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibited interest in the property. A person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions for a covered transaction has a prohibited interest in the property under paragraph (d)(1)(i) if the person has any ownership or reasonably foreseeable ownership interest in the property. For example, a person who seeks a mortgage to purchase a home has a reasonably foreseeable ownership interest in the property securing the mortgage, and therefore is not permitted to prepare the valuation or perform valuation management functions for that mortgage transaction under paragraph (d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited interest in the transaction. A person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions has a prohibited interest in the transaction under paragraph (d)(1)(i) if that person or an affiliate of that person also serves as a loan officer of the creditor, mortgage broker, real estate broker, or other settlement service provider for the transaction and the conditions under paragraph (d)(4) are not satisfied. A person also has a prohibited interest in the transaction if the person is compensated or otherwise receives financial or other benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated. Under these circumstances, the person is not permitted to prepare the valuation or perform valuation management functions for that transaction under paragraph (d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(1)(ii) Employees and affiliates of creditors; providers of multiple settlement services.</p><p class="depth0">1. Employees and affiliates of creditors. In general, a creditor may use employees or affiliates to prepare a valuation or perform valuation management functions without violating paragraph (d)(1)(i). However, whether an employee or affiliate has a direct or indirect interest in the property or transaction that creates a prohibited conflict of interest under paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, including the structure of the employment or affiliate relationship.</p><p class="depth0">2. Providers of multiple settlement services. In general, a person who prepares a valuation or perform valuation management functions for a covered transaction may perform another settlement service for the same transaction, or the person's affiliate may perform another settlement service, without violating paragraph (d)(1)(i). However, whether the person has a direct or indirect interest in the property or transaction that creates a prohibited conflict of interest under paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(2) Employees and affiliates of creditors with assets of more than $250 million for both of the past two calendar years.</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbor. A person who a prepares valuation or performs valuation management functions for a covered transaction and is an employee or affiliate of the creditor will not be deemed to have an interest prohibited under paragraph (d)(1)(i) on the basis of the employment or affiliate relationship with the creditor if the conditions in paragraph (d)(2) are satisfied. Even if the conditions in paragraph (d)(2) are satisfied, however, the person may have a prohibited conflict of interest on other grounds, such as if the person performs a valuation for a purchase-money mortgage transaction in which the person is the buyer or seller of the subject property. Thus, in general, in any covered transaction in which the creditor had assets of more than $250 million for both of the past two years, the creditor may use its own employee or affiliate to prepare a valuation or perform valuation management functions for a particular transaction, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (d)(2) are satisfied. If the conditions in paragraph (d)(2) are not satisfied, whether a person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions has violated paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on all of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibition on reporting to a person who is part of the creditor's loan production function. To qualify for the safe harbor under paragraph (d)(2), the person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions may not report to a person who is part of the creditor's loan production function (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(i) and comment 42(d)(5)(i)-1). For example, if a person preparing a valuation is directly supervised or managed by a loan officer or other person in the creditor's loan production function, or by a person who is directly supervised or managed by a loan officer, the condition under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibition on reporting to a person whose compensation is based on the transaction closing. To qualify for the safe harbor under paragraph (d)(2), the person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions may not report to a person whose compensation is based on the closing of the transaction to which the valuation relates. For example, assume an appraisal management company performs valuation management functions for a transaction in which the creditor is an affiliate of the appraisal management company. If the employee of the appraisal management company who is in charge of valuation management functions for that transaction is supervised by a person who earns a commission or bonus based on the percentage of closed transactions for which the appraisal management company provides valuation management functions, the condition under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Direct or indirect involvement in selection of person who prepares a valuation. In any covered transaction, the safe harbor under paragraph (d)(2) is available if, among other things, no employee, officer or director in the creditor's loan production function (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) and comment 42(d)(4)(ii)-1) is directly or indirectly involved in selecting, retaining, recommending or influencing the selection of the person to prepare a valuation or perform valuation management functions, or to be included in or excluded from a list or panel of approved persons who prepare valuations or perform valuation management functions. For example, if the person who selects the person to prepare the valuation for a covered transaction is supervised by an employee of the creditor who also supervises loan officers, the condition in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(3) Employees and affiliates of creditors with assets of $250 million or less for either of the past two calendar years.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Even if the conditions in paragraph (d)(3) are satisfied, however, the person may have a prohibited conflict of interest on other grounds, such as if the person performs a valuation for a purchase-money mortgage transaction in which the person is the buyer or seller of the subject property. Thus, in general, in any covered transaction in which the creditor had assets of $250 million or less for either of the past two calendar years, the creditor may use its own employee or affiliate to prepare a valuation or perform valuation management functions for a particular transaction, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) are satisfied. If the conditions in paragraph (d)(3) are not satisfied, whether a person preparing valuations or performing

valuation management functions has violated paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on all of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(4) Providers of multiple settlement services.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbor in transactions in which the creditor had assets of more than $250 million for both of the past two calendar years. A person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions in addition to performing another settlement service for the same transaction, or whose affiliate performs another settlement service for the transaction, will not be deemed to have interest prohibited under paragraph (d)(1)(i) as a result of the person or the person's affiliate performing another settlement service if the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(i) are satisfied. Even if the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(i) are satisfied, however, the person may have a prohibited conflict of interest on other grounds, such as if the person performs a valuation for a purchase-money mortgage transaction in which the person is the buyer or seller of the subject property. Thus, in general, in any covered transaction with a creditor that had assets of more than $250 million for the past two years, a person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions, or its affiliate, may provide another settlement service for the same transaction, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) are satisfied. If the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(i) are not satisfied, whether a person preparing valuations or performing valuation management functions has violated paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on all of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reporting. The safe harbor under paragraph (d)(4)(i) is available if the condition specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii), among others, is met. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) prohibits a person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions from reporting to a person whose compensation is based on the closing of the transaction to which the valuation relates. For example, assume an appraisal management company performs both valuation management functions and title services, including providing title insurance, for the same covered transaction. If the appraisal management company employee in charge of valuation management functions for the transaction is supervised by the title insurance agent in the transaction, whose compensation depends in whole or in part on whether title insurance is sold at the loan closing, the condition in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbor in transactions in which the creditor had assets of $250 million or less for either of the past two calendar years. A person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions in addition to performing another settlement service for the same transaction, or whose affiliate performs another settlement service for the transaction, will not be deemed to have an interest prohibited under paragraph (d)(1)(i) as a result of the person or the person's affiliate performing another settlement service if the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) are satisfied. Even if the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) are satisfied, however, the person may have a prohibited conflict of interest on other grounds, such as if the person performs a valuation for a purchase-money mortgage transaction in which the person is the buyer or seller of the subject property. Thus, in general, in any covered transaction in which the creditor had assets of $250 million or less for either of the past two years, a person preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions, or its affiliate, may provide other settlement services for the same transaction, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) are satisfied. If the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) are not satisfied, whether a person preparing valuations or performing valuation management functions has violated paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on all of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(5) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan production function. One condition of the safe harbors under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(4)(i), involving transactions in which the creditor had assets of more than $250 million for both of the past two calendar years, is that the person who prepares a valuation or performs valuation management functions must report to a person who is not part of the creditor's ``loan production function.'' A creditor's ``loan production function'' includes retail sales staff, loan officers, and any other employee of the creditor with responsibility for taking a loan application, offering or negotiating loan terms or whose compensation is based on loan processing volume. A person is not considered part of a creditor's loan production function solely because part of the person's compensation includes a general bonus not tied to specific transactions or a specific percentage of transactions closing, or a profit sharing plan that benefits all employees. A person solely responsible for credit administration or risk management is also not considered part of a creditor's loan production function. Credit administration and risk management includes, for example, loan underwriting, loan closing functions (e.g., loan documentation), disbursing funds, collecting mortgage payments and otherwise servicing the loan (e.g., escrow management and payment of taxes), monitoring loan performance, and foreclosure processing.</p><p class="depth0">42(e) When extension of credit prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable diligence. A creditor will be deemed to have acted with reasonable diligence under Sec. 226.42(e) if the creditor extends credit based on a valuation other than the valuation subject to the restriction in Sec. 226.42(e). A creditor need not obtain a second valuation to document that the creditor has acted with reasonable diligence to determine that the valuation does not materially misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling, however. For example, assume an appraiser notifies a creditor before consummation that a loan originator attempted to cause the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the appraiser's independent judgment, through coercion. If the creditor reasonably determines and documents that the appraisal does not materially misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling, for purposes of Sec. 226.42(e), the creditor may extend credit based on the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">42(f) Customary and reasonable compensation.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(1) Requirement to provide customary and reasonable compensation to fee appraisers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Agents of the creditor. Whether a person is an agent of the creditor is determined by applicable law; however, a ``fee appraiser'' as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(i) is not an agent of the creditor for purposes of paragraph (f), and therefore is not required to pay other fee appraisers customary and reasonable compensation under paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0">2. Geographic market. For purposes of paragraph (f), the ``geographic market of the property being appraised'' means the geographic market relevant to compensation levels for appraisal services. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the relevant geographic market may be a state, metropolitan statistical area (MSA), metropolitan division, area outside of an MSA, county, or other geographic area. For example, assume that fee appraisers who normally work only in County A generally accept $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in County A. Assume also that very few or no fee appraisers who work only in contiguous County B will accept a rate comparable to $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in County A. The relevant geographic market for an attached single-family property in County A may reasonably be defined as County A. On the other hand, assume that fee appraisers who normally work only in County A generally accept $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in County A. Assume also that many fee appraisers who normally work only in contiguous County B will accept a rate comparable to $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in County A. The relevant geographic market for an attached single-family property in County A may reasonably be defined to include both County A and County B.</p><p class="depth0">3. Failure to perform contractual obligations. Paragraph (f)(1) does not prohibit a creditor or its agent from withholding compensation from a fee appraiser for failing to meet contractual obligations, such as failing to provide the appraisal report or violating state or federal appraisal laws in performing the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">4. Agreement that fee is ``customary and reasonable.'' A document signed by a fee appraiser indicating that the appraiser agrees that the fee paid to the appraiser is ``customary and reasonable'' does not by itself create a presumption of compliance with Sec. 226.42(f) or otherwise satisfy the requirement to pay a fee appraiser at a customary and reasonable rate.</p><p class="depth0">5. Volume-based discounts. Section 226.42(f)(1) does not prohibit a fee appraiser and a creditor (or its agent) from agreeing to compensation based on transaction volume, so long as the compensation is customary and reasonable. For example, assume that a fee appraiser typically receives $300 for appraisals from creditors with whom it does business; the fee appraiser, however, agrees to reduce the fee to $280 for a particular creditor, in exchange for a minimum number of assignments from the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(2) Presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor and its agent are presumed to comply with paragraph (f)(1) if the creditor or its agent meets the conditions specified in paragraph (f)(2) in determining the compensation paid to a fee appraiser. These conditions are not requirements for compliance but, if met, create a presumption that the creditor or its agent has complied with Sec. 226.42(f)(1). A person may rebut this presumption with evidence that the amount of compensation paid to a fee appraiser was not customary and reasonable for reasons unrelated to the conditions in paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii). If a creditor or its agent does not meet one of the non-required conditions set forth in paragraph (f)(2), the creditor's and its agent's compliance with paragraph (f)(1) is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances without a presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(2)(i) Presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Two-step process for determining customary and reasonable rates. Paragraph (f)(2)(i) sets forth a two-step process for a creditor or its agent to determine the amount of compensation that is customary and reasonable in a given transaction. First, the creditor or its agent must identify recent rates paid for comparable appraisal services in the relevant geographic market. Second, once recent rates have been identified, the creditor or its agent must review the factors listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)-(F) and make any appropriate adjustments to the rates to ensure that the amount of compensation is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identifying recent rates. Whether rates may reasonably be considered ``recent'' depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, ``recent'' rates would include rates charged within one year of the creditor's or its agent's reliance on this information to qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2). For purposes of the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2), a creditor or its agent may gather information about recent rates by using a reasonable method that provides information about rates for appraisal services in the geographic market of the relevant property; a creditor or its agent may, but is not required to, use or perform a fee survey.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accounting for factors. Once recent rates in the relevant geographic market have been identified, the creditor or its agent must review the factors listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)-(F) to determine the appropriate rate for the current transaction. For example, if the recent rates identified by the creditor or its agent were solely for appraisal assignments in which the scope of work required consideration of two comparable properties, but the current transaction required an appraisal that considered three comparable properties, the creditor or its agent might reasonably adjust the rate by an amount that accounts for the increased scope of work, in addition to making any other appropriate adjustments based on the remaining factors.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Type of property. The type of property may include, for example, detached or attached single-family property, condominium or cooperative unit, or manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of work. The scope of work may include, for example, the type of inspection (such as exterior only or both interior and exterior) or number of comparables required for the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser qualifications. The fee appraiser qualifications may include, for example, a state license or certification in accordance with the minimum criteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of the Appraisal Foundation, or completion of continuing education courses on effective appraisal methods and related topics.</p><p class="depth0">2. Membership in professional appraisal organization. Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(D) does not override state or federal laws prohibiting the exclusion of an appraiser from consideration for an assignment solely by virtue of membership or lack of membership in any particular appraisal organization. See, e.g., 12 CFR 225.66(a).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(E).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser experience and professional record. The fee appraiser's level of experience may include, for example, the fee appraiser's years of service as a state-licensed or state-certified appraiser, or years of service appraising properties in a particular geographical area or of a particular type. The fee appraiser's professional record may include, for example, whether the fee appraiser has a past record of suspensions, disqualifications, debarments, or judgments for waste, fraud, abuse or breach of legal or professional standards.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(F).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser work quality. The fee appraiser's work quality may include, for example, the past quality of appraisals performed by the appraiser based on the written performance and review criteria of the creditor or agent of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Restraining trade. Under Sec. 226.42(f)(2)(ii)(A), creditor or its agent would not qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2) if it engaged in any acts to restrain trade such as entering into a price fixing or market allocation agreement that affect the compensation of fee appraisers. For example, if appraisal management company A and appraisal management company B agreed to compensate fee appraisers at no more than a specific rate or range of rates, neither appraisal management company would qualify for the presumption of compliance. Likewise, if appraisal management company A and appraisal management company B agreed that appraisal management company A would limit its business to a certain portion of the relevant geographic market and appraisal management company B would limit its business to a different portion of the relevant geographic market, and as a result each appraisal management company unilaterally set the fees paid to fee appraisers in their respective portions of the market, neither appraisal management company would qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Acts of monopolization. Under Sec. 226.42(f)(2)(ii)(B), a creditor or its agent would not qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2) if it engaged in any act of monopolization such as restricting entry into the relevant geographic market or causing any person to leave the relevant geographic market, resulting in anticompetitive effects that affect the compensation paid to fee appraisers. For example, if only one appraisal management company exists or is predominant in a particular market area, that appraisal management company might not qualify for the presumption of compliance if it entered into exclusivity agreements with all creditors in the market or all fee appraisers in the market, such that other appraisal management companies had to leave or could not enter the market. Whether this behavior would be considered an anticompetitive act that affects the compensation paid to fee appraisers

depends on all of the facts and circumstances, including applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(3) Alternative presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor and its agent are presumed to comply with paragraph (f)(1) if the creditor or its agent determine the compensation paid to a fee appraiser based on information about customary and reasonable rates that satisfies the conditions in paragraph (f)(3) for that information. Reliance on information satisfying the conditions in paragraph (f)(3) is not a requirement for compliance with paragraph (f)(1), but creates a presumption that the creditor or its agent has complied. A person may rebut this presumption with evidence that the rate of compensation paid to a fee appraiser by the creditor or its agent is not customary and reasonable based on facts or information other than third-party information satisfying the conditions of this paragraph (f)(3). If a creditor or its agent does not rely on information that meets the conditions in paragraph (f)(3), the creditor's and its agent's compliance with paragraph (f)(1) is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances without a presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Geographic market. The meaning of ``geographic market'' for purposes of paragraph (f) is explained in comment (f)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">3. Recent rates. Whether rates may reasonably be considered ``recent'' depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, ``recent'' rates would include rates charged within one year of the creditor's or its agent's reliance on this information to qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(3).</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(4) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(4)(i) Fee appraiser.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Reasonable basis. A person reasonably believes that an appraiser has materially failed to comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) established by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(9)) or ethical or professional requirements for appraisers under applicable state or federal statutes or regulations if the person possesses knowledge or information that would lead a reasonable person in the same circumstances to conclude that the appraiser has materially failed to comply with USPAP or such statutory or regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material failure to comply. For purposes of Sec. 226.42(g)(1), a material failure to comply is one that is likely to affect the value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling. The following are examples of a material failure to comply with USPAP or ethical or professional requirements</p><p class="depth0">i. Mischaracterizing the value of the consumer's principal dwelling in violation of Sec. 226.42(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Performing an assignment in a grossly negligent manner, in violation of a rule under USPAP.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Accepting an appraisal assignment on the condition that the appraiser will report a value equal to or greater than the purchase price for the consumer's principal dwelling, in violation of a rule under USPAP.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other matters. Section 226.42(g)(1) does not require reporting of a matter that is not material under Sec. 226.42(g)(1), for example</p><p class="depth0">i. An appraiser's disclosure of confidential information in violation of applicable state law.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An appraiser's failure to maintain errors and omissions insurance in violation of applicable state law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples of covered persons. ``Covered persons'' include creditors, mortgage brokers, appraisers, appraisal management companies, real estate agents, and other persons that provide ``settlement services'' as defined under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and implementing regulations.

The loan is--(1) not subject to the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in 12 CFR 1026.43 as a ``covered transaction'' (defined in 12 CFR 1026.43(b)(1)), but (2) meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the Bureau's rules or, for loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). To explain further, loans enumerated in 12 CFR 1026.43(a) are not ``covered transactions'' under the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in 12 CFR 1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of 12 CFR 1026.43, see, e.g., 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. See 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in Sec. 226.43(b)(1) if they meet the Bureau's qualified mortgage criteria in Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or Sec. 1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a ``covered transaction'' and thus is not a qualified mortgage. See 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and

(b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of Sec. 226.43 if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD's rules. Nothing in Sec. 226.43(b)(1) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec. 226.43(b)(2), the threshold amount in effect during a particular one-year period is the amount stated below for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Every year, this comment will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming one-year period after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.</p><p class="depth0">i. From January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the threshold amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold amount is $25,500.</p><p class="depth0">iii. From January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, the threshold amount is $25,500.</p><p class="depth0">2. Qualifying for exemption--in general. A transaction is exempt under Sec. 226.43(b)(2) if the creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation that is equal to or below the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Qualifying for exemption--subsequent changes. A transaction does not meet the condition for an exemption under Sec. 226.43(b)(2) merely because it is used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt loan, unless the amount of the new extension of credit is equal to or less than the applicable threshold amount. For example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec. 226.43(b)(2) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is greater than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of Sec. 226.43 with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless another exemption from the requirements of Sec. 226.43 applies. See Sec. 226.43(b) and (d)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Secured by a mobile home. For purposes of the exemption in Sec. 226.43(b)(3), a mobile home does not include a manufactured home, as defined in Sec. 226.43(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction-to-permanent loans. Section 226.43 does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 226.43 does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of Sec. 226.43. See Sec. 226.43(b). When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit pursuant to Regulation Z (12 CFR 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See 12 CFR 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 17(c)(6)-2. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to Sec. 226.43. When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under Sec. 226.43. When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with Sec. 226.43(a)(3) and appendix D to 12 CFR part 1026. The annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under Sec. 226.43. If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced mortgage loan not otherwise exempt under Sec. 226.43(b), only the permanent phase is subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.43.</p><p class="depth0">2. Financing initial construction. The exemption for construction loans in Sec. 226.43(b)(4) applies to temporary financing of the construction of a dwelling that will be replaced by permanent financing once construction is complete. The exemption does not apply, for example, to loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes that have not been or are in the process of being built when the financing obtained by the consumer at that time is permanent. See Sec. 226.43(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(7)(i)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Same credit risk holder. The requirement that the holder of the credit risk on the existing obligation and the refinancing be the

same applies to situations in which an entity bears the financial responsibility for the default of a loan by either holding the loan in its portfolio or guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to investors in a mortgage-backed security in which the loan is pooled. See Sec. 226.43(a)(4) (defining ``credit risk''). For example, a credit risk holder could be a bank that bears the credit risk on the existing obligation by holding the loan in the bank's portfolio. Another example of a credit risk holder would be a government-sponsored enterprise that bears the risk of default on a loan by guaranteeing the payment of principal and any interest on a loan to investors in a mortgage-backed security. The holder of credit risk under Sec. 226.43(b)(7)(i)(A) does not mean individual investors in a mortgage-backed security or providers of private mortgage insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same credit risk holder--illustrations.</p><p class="depth0">Illustrations of the credit risk holder of the existing obligation continuing to be the credit risk holder of the refinancing include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a bank, thus the bank holds the credit risk. The bank arranges to refinance the loan and also will hold the refinancing in its portfolio. If the refinancing otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under Sec. 226.43(b)(7), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the bank arranged to refinance the loan directly or indirectly, such as through the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), thus the GSE holds the credit risk. The existing obligation is then refinanced by the servicer of the loan and immediately transferred to the GSE. The GSE pools the refinancing in a mortgage-backed security guaranteed by the GSE, thus the GSE holds the credit risk on the refinance loan. If the refinance transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under Sec. 226.43(b)(7), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the existing obligation was refinanced by the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation (acting as a ``creditor'' under Sec. 1026.2(a)(17)) or by a different creditor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that will be sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward commitment.'' A refinance loan does not satisfy the requirement of Sec. 226.43(b)(7)(i)(A) if the loan will be acquired pursuant to a forward commitment, such that the credit risk on the refinance loan will transfer to a person who did not hold the credit risk on the existing obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(7)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(7)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. Under Sec. 226.43(b)(7)(ii), the regular periodic payments on the refinance loan must not: result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization); allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (see 12 CFR 1026.43 and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2); or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term ``substantially equal,'' see 12 CFR 1026.43 and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a refinancing meeting the requirements of Sec. 226.43(b)(7) because it does not require ``regular periodic payments.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(7)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible use of proceeds. The exemption for a refinancing under Sec. 226.43(b)(7) is available only if the proceeds from the refinancing are used exclusively for the existing obligation and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. The existing obligation includes the unpaid principal balance of the existing first lien loan, any earned unpaid finance charges, and any other lawful charges related to the existing loan. For guidance on the meaning of refinancing costs, see 12 CFR 1026.23, the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulations Z, comment 23(f)-4. If the proceeds of a refinancing are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a refinancing under Sec. 226.43(b)(7) from the appraisal requirements in Sec. 226.43.</p><p class="depth0">For applications received on or after July 18, 2015</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(8)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(8)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Secured by new manufactured home and land--physical visit of the interior. A transaction secured by a new manufactured home and land is subject to the requirements of

Sec. 226.43(c) through (f) except for the requirement in Sec. 226.43(c)(1) that the appraiser conduct a physical inspection of the interior of the property. Thus, for example, a creditor of a loan secured by a new manufactured home and land could comply with Sec. 226.43(c)(1) by obtaining an appraisal conducted by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser based on plans and specifications for the new manufactured home and an inspection of the land on which the property will be sited, as well as any other information necessary for the appraiser to complete the appraisal assignment in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and the requirements of FIRREA and any implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(8)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Secured by a manufactured home and not land. Section 226.43(b)(8)(ii) applies to a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a manufactured home and not land, regardless of whether the home is titled as realty by operation of State law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(8)(ii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Independent. A cost service provider from which the creditor obtains a manufactured home unit cost estimate under Sec. 226.43(b)(8)(ii)(B) is ``independent'' if that person is not affiliated with the creditor in the transaction, such as by common corporate ownership, and receives no direct or indirect financial benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustments. The requirement that the cost estimate be from an independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to account for factors such as special features, condition or location. However, the requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost service used, with associated values that are determined by the independent cost service.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(8)(ii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest in the property. A person has a direct or indirect in the property if, for example, the person has any ownership or reasonably foreseeable ownership interest in the manufactured home. To illustrate, a person who seeks a loan to purchase the manufactured home to be valued has a reasonably foreseeable ownership interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest in the transaction. A person has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction if, for example, the person or an affiliate of that person also serves as a loan officer of the creditor or otherwise arranges the credit transaction, or is the retail dealer of the manufactured home. A person also has a prohibited interest in the transaction if the person is compensated or otherwise receives financial or other benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">3.

Training in valuing manufactured homes includes, for example, successfully completing a course in valuing manufactured homes offered by a State or national appraiser association or receiving job training from an employer in the business of valuing manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Manufactured home valuation--example. A valuation in compliance with Sec. 226.43(b)(8)(ii)(C) would include, for example, an appraisal of the manufactured home in accordance with the appraisal requirements for a manufactured home classified as personal property under the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Insurance Program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, pursuant to section 2(b)(10) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1703(b)(10).</p><p class="depth0">43(c) Appraisals required.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(1) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Safe harbor. A creditor that satisfies the safe harbor conditions in Sec. 226.43(c)(2)(i) through (iv) complies with the appraisal requirements of Sec. 226.43(c)(1). A creditor that does not satisfy the safe harbor conditions in Sec. 226.43(c)(2)(i) through (iv) does not necessarily violate the appraisal requirements of Sec. 226.43(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2.

Acquisition. For purposes of Sec. 226.43(d), the terms ``acquisition'' and ``acquire'' refer to the acquisition of legal title to the property pursuant to applicable State law, including by purchase.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(1) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1. Appraisal from a previous transaction. An appraisal that was previously obtained in connection with the seller's acquisition or the financing of the seller's acquisition of the property does not satisfy the requirements to obtain two written appraisals under Sec. 226.43(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. 90-day, 180-day calculation. The time periods described in Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) and (ii) are calculated by counting the day after the date on which the seller acquired the property, up to and including the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property that secures the transaction. For example, assume that the creditor determines that date of the consumer's acquisition agreement is October 15, 2012, and that the seller acquired the property on April 17, 2012. The first day to be counted in the 180-day calculation would be April 18, 2012, and the last day would be October 15, 2012. In this case, the number of days from April 17 would be 181, so an additional appraisal is not required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date seller acquired the property. For purposes of Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) and (ii), the date on which the seller acquired the property is the date on which the seller became the legal owner of the property pursuant to applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. For the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property under Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) and (ii), the creditor should use the date on which the consumer and the seller signed the agreement provided to the creditor by the consumer. The date on which the consumer and the seller signed the agreement might not be the date on which the consumer became contractually obligated under State law to acquire the property. For purposes of Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) and (ii), a creditor is not obligated to determine whether and to what extent the agreement is legally binding on both parties. If the dates on which the consumer and the seller signed the agreement differ, the creditor should use the later of the two dates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Price at which the seller acquired the property. The price at which the seller acquired the property refers to the amount paid by the seller to acquire the property. The price at which the seller acquired the property does not include the cost of financing the property.</p><p class="depth0">6. Price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property. The price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property is the price indicated on the consumer's agreement with the seller to acquire the property. The price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property from the seller does not include the cost of financing the property. For purposes of Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) and (ii), a creditor is not obligated to determine whether and to what extent the agreement is legally binding on both parties. See also comment 43(d)(1)-4.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(2) Different certified or licensed appraisers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Independent appraisers. The requirements that a creditor obtain two separate appraisals under Sec. 226.43(d)(1), and that each appraisal be conducted by a different licensed or certified appraiser under Sec. 226.43(d)(2), indicate that the two appraisals must be conducted independently of each other. If the two certified or licensed appraisers are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same appraisal firm, then whether they have conducted the appraisal independently of each other must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case known to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(3) Relationship to general appraisal requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbor. When a creditor is required to obtain an additional appraisal under Sec. 226(d)(1), the creditor must comply with the requirements of both Sec. 226.43(c)(1) and Sec. 226.43(d)(2) through (5) for that appraisal. The creditor complies with the requirements of Sec. 226.43(c)(1) for the additional appraisal if the creditor meets the safe harbor conditions in Sec. 226.43(c)(2) for that appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(4) Required analysis in the additional appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Estimated sales price. If a written source document describes the seller's acquisition price in a manner that indicates that the price described is an estimated or assumed amount and not the actual price, the creditor should look at an alternative document to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard in determining the price at which the seller acquired the property.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable diligence--oral statements insufficient. Reliance on oral statements of interested parties, such as the consumer, seller, or mortgage broker, does not constitute reasonable diligence under Sec. 226.43(d)(6)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Lack of information and conflicting information--two appraisals required. If a creditor is unable to demonstrate that the requirement to obtain two appraisals under Sec. 226.43(d)(1) does not apply, the creditor must obtain two written appraisals before

extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.43. See also comment 43(d)(6)(ii)-1. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor orders and reviews the results of a title search, which shows that a prior sale occurred between 91 and 180 days ago, but not the price paid in that sale. Thus, based on the title search, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the price the consumer is obligated to pay under the consumer's acquisition agreement is more than 20 percent higher than the seller's acquisition price, pursuant to Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(ii). Before extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of Sec. 226.43, the creditor must either: perform additional diligence to ascertain the seller's acquisition price and, based on this information, determine whether two written appraisals are required; or obtain two written appraisals in compliance with Sec. 226.43(d). See also comment 43(d)(6)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor reviews the results of a title search indicating that the last recorded purchase was more than 180 days before the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. Assume also that the creditor subsequently receives a written appraisal indicating that the seller acquired the property between 91 and 180 days before the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. In this case, unless one of these sources is clearly wrong on its face, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the seller acquired the property within 180 days of the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property from the seller, pursuant to Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(ii). Before extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of Sec. 226.43, the creditor must either: (1) Perform additional diligence to ascertain the seller's acquisition date and, based on this information, determine whether two written appraisals are required; or (2) obtain two written appraisals in compliance with Sec. 226.43(d). See also comment 43(d)(6)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(6)(ii) Inability to determine prior sales date or price--modified requirements for additional appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">1. Required analysis. In general, the additional appraisal required under Sec. 226.43(d)(1) should include an analysis of the factors listed in Sec. 226.43(d)(4)(i) through (iii). However, if, following reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in Sec. 226.43(d)(1)(i) or (ii) are present due to a lack of information or conflicting information, the required additional appraisal must include the analyses required under Sec. 226.43(d)(4)(i) through (iii) only to the extent that the information necessary to perform the analyses is known. For example, assume that a creditor is able, following reasonable diligence, to determine that the date on which the seller acquired the property occurred between 91 and 180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is unable, following reasonable diligence, to determine the price at which the seller acquired the property. In this case, the creditor is required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes an analysis under Sec. 226.43(d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of the changes in market conditions and any improvements made to the property between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is not required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes analysis under Sec. 226.43(d)(4)(i) of the difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(7) Exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(7)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Multiple applicants. When two or more consumers apply for a loan subject to this section, the creditor is required to give the disclosure to only one of the consumers.</p><p class="depth0">2. Appraisal independence requirements not affected. Nothing in the text of the consumer notice required by Sec. 226.43(e)(1) should be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or restrictions on the use of borrower-ordered appraisals by creditors.</p><p class="depth0">43(f) Copy of appraisals.</p><p class="depth0">43(f)(1) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple applicants. When two or more consumers apply for a loan subject to this

section, the creditor is required to give the copy of each required appraisal to only one of the consumers.</p><p class="depth0">43(f)(2) Timing.</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Provide.'' For purposes of the requirement to provide a copy of the appraisal within a specified time under Sec. 226.43(f)(2), ``provide'' means ``deliver.'' Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant (which, in the case of electronic receipt, must be based upon consent that complies with the E-Sign Act), whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">2. No waiver. Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(1), allowing the consumer to waive the requirement that the appraisal copy be provided three business days before consummation, does not apply to higher-priced mortgage loans subject to Sec. 226.43. A consumer of a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to Sec. 226.43 may not waive the timing requirement to receive a copy of the appraisal under Sec. 226.43(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">43(f)(4) No charge for copy of appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees and mark-ups. The creditor is prohibited from charging the consumer for any copy of an appraisal required to be provided under Sec. 226.43(f)(1), including by imposing a fee specifically for a required copy of an appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-priced mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F--Special Rules for Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.46--Special Disclosure Requirements for Private Education</p><p class="depth0">Loans</p><p class="depth0">46(a) Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This subpart applies to all private education loans as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(5). Coverage under this subpart is optional for certain extensions of credit that do not meet the definition of ``private education loan'' because the credit is not extended, in whole or in part, for ``postsecondary educational expenses'' defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(3). If a transaction is not covered and a creditor opts to comply with any section of this subpart, the creditor must comply with all applicable sections of this subpart. If a transaction is not covered and a creditor opts not to comply with this subpart, the creditor must comply with all applicable requirements under Sec. Sec. 226.17 and 226.18. Compliance with this subpart is optional for an extension of credit for expenses incurred after graduation from a law, medical, dental, veterinary, or other graduate school and related to relocation, study for a bar or other examination, participation in an internship or residency program, or similar purposes. However, if any part of such loan is used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(3), then compliance with Subpart F is mandatory not optional.</p><p class="depth0">46(b) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(1) Covered Educational Institution</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A covered educational institution includes any educational institution that meets the definition of an institution of higher education in Sec. 226.46(b)(2). An institution is also a covered educational institution if it otherwise meets the definition of an institution of higher education, except for its lack of accreditation. Such an institution may include, for example, a university or community college. It may also include an institution, whether accredited or unaccredited, offering instruction to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized profession, such as flying, culinary arts, or dental assistance. A covered educational institution does not include elementary or secondary schools.</p><p class="depth0">2. Agent. For purposes of Sec. 226.46(b)(1), the term agent means an institution-affiliated organization as defined by section 151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C 1019) or an officer or employee of an institution-affiliated organization. Under section 151 of the Higher Education Act, an institution-affiliated organization means any organization that is directly or indirectly related to a covered institution and is engaged in the practice of recommending, promoting, or endorsing education loans for students attending the covered institution or the families of such students. An institution-affiliated organization may include an alumni organization, athletic organization, foundation, or social, academic, or professional organization, of a covered institution, but does not include any creditor with respect to any private education loan made by that creditor.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(2) Institution of higher education.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. An institution of higher education includes any institution that meets the definitions contained in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001-1002) and implementing Department of Education regulations (34 CFR 600). Such an institution may include, for example, a university or community college. It may also include an institution offering instruction to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized profession, such as flying, culinary arts, or dental assistance. An institution of higher education does not include elementary or secondary schools.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(3) Postsecondary educational expenses.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The examples listed in Sec. 226.46(b)(3) are illustrative only. The full list of postsecondary educational expenses is contained in section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087ll).</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(4) Preferred lender arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The term ``preferred lender arrangement'' is defined in section 151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C 1019). The term refers to an arrangement or agreement between a creditor and a covered educational institution (or an institution-affiliated organization as defined by section 151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C 1019)) under which a creditor provides private education loans to consumers for students attending the covered educational institution and the covered educational institution recommends, promotes, or endorses the private education loan products of the creditor. It does not include arrangements or agreements with respect to Federal Direct Stafford/Ford loans, or Federal PLUS loans made under the Federal PLUS auction pilot program.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(5) Private education loan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Extended expressly for postsecondary educational expenses. A private education loan is one that is extended expressly for postsecondary educational expenses. The term includes loans extended for postsecondary educational expenses incurred while a student is enrolled in a covered educational institution as well as loans extended to consolidate a consumer's pre-existing private education loans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple-purpose loans. i. Definition. A private education loan may include an extension of credit not excluded under Sec. 226.46(b)(5) that the consumer may use for multiple purposes including, but not limited to, postsecondary educational expenses. If the consumer expressly indicates that the proceeds of the loan will be used to pay for postsecondary educational expenses by indicating the loan's purpose on an application, the loan is a private education loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Coverage. A creditor generally will not know before an application is received whether the consumer intends to use the loan for postsecondary educational expenses. For this reason, the creditor need not provide the disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(a) on or with the application or solicitation for a loan that may be used for multiple purposes. See Sec. 226.47(d)(1)(i). However, if the consumer expressly indicates that the proceeds of the loan will be used to pay for postsecondary educational expenses, the creditor must comply with Sec. Sec. 226.47(b) and (c) and Sec. 226.48. For purposes of the required disclosures, the creditor must calculate the disclosures based on the entire amount of the loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is intended for postsecondary educational expenses. The creditor may rely solely on a check-box, or a purpose line, on a loan application to determine whether or not the applicant intends to use loan proceeds for postsecondary educational expenses.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. The creditor must comply only if the extension of credit also meets the other parts of the definition of private education loan. For example, if the creditor uses a single application form for both open-end and closed-end credit, and the consumer applies for open-end credit to be used for postsecondary educational expenses, the extension of credit is not covered. Similarly, if the consumer indicates the extension of credit will be used for educational expenses that are not postsecondary educational expenses, such as elementary or secondary educational expenses, the extension of credit is not covered. These examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive.</p><p class="depth0">3. Short-term loans. Some covered educational institutions offer loans to students with terms of 90 days or less to assist the student in paying for educational expenses, usually while the student waits for other funds to be disbursed. Under Sec. 226.46(b)(5)(iv)(A) such loans are not considered private education loans, even if interest is charged on the credit balance. (Because these loans charge interest, they are not covered by the exception under Sec. 226.46(b)(5)(iv)(B).) However, these loans are extensions of credit subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.17 and 18. The legal agreement may provide that repayment is required when the consumer or the educational institution receives certain funds. If, under the terms of the legal obligation, repayment of the loan is required when the certain funds are received by the consumer or the educational institution (such as by deposit into the consumer's or educational institution's account), the disclosures should be based on the creditor's estimate of the time the funds will be delivered.</p><p class="depth0">4. Billing plans. Some covered educational institutions offer billing plans that permit a consumer to make payments in installments. Such plans are not considered private education loans, if an interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the extension of credit is one year or less, even if the plan is payable in more than four installments. However, such plans may be extensions of credit subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 226.17 and 18.</p><p class="depth0">46(c) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures--relation to other sections. Creditors must make the disclosures required under this subpart in accordance with Sec. 226.46(c). Section 226.46(c)(2) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. In complying with this requirement, creditors may follow the rules in Sec. 226.17, except where specifically provided otherwise. For example, although Sec. 226.17(b) requires creditors to provide only one set of disclosures before consummation of the transaction, Sec. Sec. 226.47(b) and (c) require that the creditor provide the disclosures under Sec. 226.18 both upon approval and after the consumer accepts the loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 46(c)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Application and solicitation disclosures--electronic disclosures. If the disclosures required under Sec. 226.47(a) are provided electronically, they must be provided on or with the application or solicitation reply form. Electronic disclosures are deemed to be on or with an application or solicitation if they meet one of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">i. They automatically appear on the screen when the application or solicitation reply form appears;</p><p class="depth0">ii. They are located on the same Web ``page'' as the application or solicitation reply form without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, if the application or reply form contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. They are posted on a Web site and the application or solicitation reply form is linked to the disclosures in a manner that prevents the consumer from by passing the disclosures before submitting the application or reply form.</p><p class="depth0">46(d) Timing of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Receipt of disclosures. Under Sec. 226.46(d)(4), if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are mailed. For purposes of Sec. 226.46(d)(4), ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to in Sec. 226.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)-2. For example, if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, the disclosures are considered received on Monday, June 8.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 46(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Invitations to apply. A creditor may contact a consumer who has not been pre-selected for a private education loan about taking out a loan (whether by direct mail, telephone, or other means) and invite the consumer to complete an application. Such a contact does not meet the definition of solicitation, nor is it covered by this subpart, unless the contact itself includes the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. An application form in a direct mailing, electronic communication or a single application form as a ``take-one'' (in racks in public locations, for example);</p><p class="depth0">ii. An oral application in a telephone contact; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. An application in an in-person contact.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 46(d)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. The creditor must provide the disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(b) at the time the creditor provides to the consumer any notice that the loan has been approved. However, nothing in this section prevents the creditor from communicating to the consumer that additional information is required from the consumer before approval may be granted. In such a case, a creditor is not required to provide the disclosures at that time. If the creditor communicates notice of approval to the consumer by mail, the disclosures must be mailed at the same time as the notice of approval. If the creditor communicates notice of approval by telephone, the creditor must place the disclosures in the mail within three business days of the telephone call. If the creditor communicates notice of approval in electronic form, the creditor may provide the disclosures in electronic form. If the creditor has complied with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) the creditor may provide the disclosures solely in electronic form; otherwise, the creditor must place the disclosures in the mail within three business days of the communication.</p><p class="depth0">46(g) Effect of subsequent events</p><p class="depth0">1. Approval disclosures. Inaccuracies in the disclosures required under Sec. 226.47(b) are not violations if attributable to events occurring after disclosures are made, although creditors are restricted under Sec. 226.48(c)(2) from making certain changes to the loan's rate or terms after the creditor provides an approval disclosure to a consumer. Since creditors are required provide the final disclosures under Sec. 226.47(c), they need not make new approval disclosures in response to an event that occurs after the creditor delivers the required approval disclosures, except as specified under Sec. 226.48(c)(4). For example, at the time the approval disclosures are provided, the creditor may not know the precise disbursement date of the loan funds and must provide estimated disclosures based on the best information reasonably available and labelled as an estimate. If, after the approval disclosures are provided, the creditor learns from the educational institution the precise disbursement date, new approval disclosures would not be required, unless specifically required under Sec. 226.48(c)(4) if other changes are made. Similarly, the creditor may not know the precise amounts of each loan to be consolidated in a consolidation loan transaction and information about the precise amounts would not require new approval disclosures, unless specifically required under Sec. 226.48(c)(4) if other changes are made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Final disclosures. Inaccuracies in the disclosures required under Sec. 226.47(c) are not violations if attributable to events occurring after disclosures are made. For example, if the consumer initially chooses to defer payment of principal and interest while enrolled in a covered educational institution, but

later chooses to make payments while enrolled, such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.47--Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. As applicable. The disclosures required by this subpart need be made only as applicable, unless specifically required otherwise. The creditor need not provide any disclosure that is not applicable to a particular transaction. For example, in a transaction consolidating private education loans, or in transactions under Sec. 226.46(a) for which compliance with this subpart is optional, the creditor need not disclose the information under Sec. Sec. 226.47(a)(6), and (b)(4), and any other information otherwise required to be disclosed under this subpart that is not applicable to the transaction. Similarly, creditors making loans to consumers where the student is not attending an institution of higher education, as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(2), need not provide the disclosures regarding the self-certification form in Sec. 226.47(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0">47(a) Application or Solicitation Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rates actually offered. The disclosure may state only those rates that the creditor is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not disclose a very low interest rate that will not in fact be offered at any time. For a loan with variable interest rates, the ranges of rates will be considered actually offered if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For disclosures in applications or solicitations sent by direct mail, the rates were in effect within 60 days before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For disclosures in applications or solicitations in electronic form, the rates were in effect within 30 days before the disclosures are sent to a consumer, or for disclosures made on an Internet Web site, within 30 days before being viewed by the public;</p><p class="depth0">iii. For disclosures in printed applications or solicitations made available to the general public, the rates were in effect within 30 days before printing; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. For disclosures provided orally in telephone applications or solicitations, the rates are currently available at the time the disclosures are provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditworthiness and other factors. If the rate will depend, at least in part, on a later determination of the consumer's creditworthiness or other factors, the disclosure must include a statement that the rate for which the consumer may qualify at approval will depend on the consumer's creditworthiness and other factors. The creditor may, but is not required to, specify any additional factors that it will use to determine the interest rate. For example, if the creditor will determine the interest rate based on information in the consumer's or co-signer's credit report and the type of school the consumer attends, the creditor may state, ``Your interest rate will be based on your credit history and other factors (co-signer credit and school type).''</p><p class="depth0">3. Rates applicable to the loan. For a variable-rate private education loan, the disclosure of the interest rate or range of rates must reflect the rate or rates calculated based on the index and margin that will be used to make interest rate adjustments for the loan. The creditor may provide a description of the index and margin or range of margins used to make interest rate adjustments, including a reference to a source, such as a newspaper, where the consumer may look up the index.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The interest rate is considered variable if the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the interest rate originally disclosed to the consumer and the requirements of section 226.47(a)(1)(iii) apply to all such transactions. The provisions do not apply to increases resulting from delinquency (including late payment), default, assumption, or acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations. The creditor must disclose how often the rate may change and any limit on the amount that the rate may increase at any one time. The creditor must also disclose any maximum rate over the life of the transaction. If the legal obligation between the parties does specify a maximum rate, the creditor must disclose any legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations. However, if the applicable maximum rate is in the form of a legal limit, such as a state's usury cap (rather than a maximum rate specified in the legal obligation between the parties), the creditor must disclose that the maximum rate is determined by applicable law. The creditor must also disclose that the consumer's actual rate may be higher or lower than the initial rates disclosed under Sec. 226.47(a)(1)(i), if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Co-signer or guarantor--changes in applicable interest rate. The creditor must state whether the interest rate typically will be higher if the loan is not co-signed or guaranteed by a third party. The creditor is required to provide a statement of the effect on the interest rate and is not required to provide a numerical estimate of the effect on the interest rate. For example, a creditor may state: ``Rates are typically higher without a co-signer.''</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(2) Fees and Default or Late Payment Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or range of fees. The creditor must itemize fees required to obtain the private education loan. The creditor must give a single dollar amount for each fee, unless the fee

is based on a percentage, in which case a percentage must be stated. If the exact amount of the fee is not known at the time of disclosure, the creditor may disclose the dollar amount or percentage for each fee as an estimated range.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees required to obtain the private education loan. The creditor must itemize the fees that the consumer must pay to obtain the private education loan. Fees disclosed include all finance charges under Sec. 226.4, such as loan origination fees, credit report fees, and fees charged upon entering repayment, as well as fees not considered finance charges but required to obtain credit, such as application fees that are charged whether or not credit is extended. Fees disclosed include those paid by the consumer directly to the creditor and fees paid to third parties by the creditor on the consumer's behalf. Creditors are not required to disclose fees that apply if the consumer exercises an option under the loan agreement after consummation, such as fees for deferment, forbearance, or loan modification.</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(3) Repayment Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan term. The term of the loan is the maximum period of time during which regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest will be due on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment deferral options--general. The creditor must describe the options that the consumer has under the loan agreement to defer payment on the loan. When there is no deferment option provided for the loan, the creditor must disclose that fact. Payment deferral options required to be disclosed include options for immediate deferral of payments, such as when the student is currently enrolled at a covered educational institution. The description may include of the length of the maximum initial in-school deferment period, the types of payments that may be deferred, and a description of any payments that are required during the deferment period. The creditor may, but need not, disclose any conditions applicable to the deferment option, such as that deferment is permitted only while the student is continuously enrolled in school. If payment deferral is not an option while the student is enrolled in school, the creditor may disclose that the consumer must begin repayment upon disbursement of the loan and that the consumer may not defer repayment while enrolled in school. If the creditor offers payment deferral options that may apply during the repayment period, such as an option to defer payments if the student returns to school to pursue an additional degree, the creditor must include a statement referring the consumer to the contract document or promissory note for more information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment deferral options--in school deferment. For each payment deferral option applicable while the student is enrolled at a covered educational institution the creditor must disclose whether interest will accrue while the student is enrolled at a covered educational institution and, if interest does accrue, whether payment of interest may be deferred and added to the principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">4. Combination with cost estimate disclosure. The disclosures of the loan term under Sec. 226.47(a)(3)(i) and of the payment deferral options applicable while the student is enrolled at a covered educational institution under Sec. Sec. 226.47(a)(3)(ii) and (iii) may be combined with the disclosure of cost estimates required in Sec. 226.47(a)(4). For example, the creditor may describe each payment deferral option in the same chart or table that provides the cost estimates for each payment deferral option. See Appendix H-21.</p><p class="depth0">5. Bankruptcy limitations. The creditor may comply with Sec. 226.47(a)(3)(iv) by disclosing the following statement: ``If you file for bankruptcy you may still be required to pay back this loan.''</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(4) Cost Estimates</p><p class="depth0">1. Total cost of the loan. For purposes of Sec. 226.47(a)(4), the creditor must calculate the example of the total cost of the loan in accordance with the rules in Sec. 226.18(h) for calculating the loan's total of payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Basis for estimates. i. The creditor must calculate the total cost estimate by determining all finance charges that would be applicable to loans with the highest rate of interest required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.47(a)(1)(i). For example, if a creditor charges a range of origination fees from 0% to 3%, but the 3% origination fee would apply to loans with the highest initial rate, the lender must assume the 3% origination fee is charged. The creditor must base the total cost estimate on a total loan amount that includes all prepaid finance charges and results in a $10,000 amount financed. For example, if the prepaid finance charges are $600, the creditor must base the estimate on a $10,600 total loan amount and an amount financed of $10,000. The example must reflect an amount provided of $10,000. If the creditor only offers a particular private education loan for less than $10,000, the creditor may assume a loan amount that results in a $5,000 amount financed for that loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a prepaid finance charge is determined as a percentage of the amount financed, for purposes of the example, the creditor should assume that the fee is determined as a percentage of the total loan amount, even if this is not the creditor's usual practice. For example, suppose the consumer requires a disbursement of $10,000 and the creditor charges a 3% origination fee. In order to calculate the total cost example, the creditor must determine the loan amount that will result in a $10,000 amount financed after the 3% fee is assessed. In this

example, the resulting loan amount would be $10,309.28. Assessing the 3% origination fee on the loan amount of $10,309.28 results in an origination fee of $309.28, which is withheld from the loan funds disbursed to the consumer. The principal loan amount of $10,309.28 minus the prepaid finance charge of $309.28 results in an amount financed of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculated for each option to defer interest payments. The example must include an estimate of the total cost of the loan for each in-school deferral option disclosed in Sec. 226.47(a)(3)(iii). For example, if the creditor provides the consumer with the option to begin making principal and interest payments immediately, to defer principal payments but begin making interest-only payments immediately, or to defer all principal and interest payments while in school, the creditor is required to disclose three estimates of the total cost of the loan, one for each deferral option. If the creditor adds accrued interest to the loan balance (i.e., interest is capitalized), the estimate of the total loan cost should be based on the capitalization method that the creditor actually uses for the loan. For instance, for each deferred payment option where the creditor would capitalize interest on a quarterly basis, the total loan cost must be calculated assuming interest capitalizes on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth0">4. Deferment period assumptions. Creditors may use either of the following two methods for estimating the duration of in-school deferment periods:</p><p class="depth0">i. For loan programs intended for educational expenses of undergraduate students, the creditor may assume that the consumer defers payments for a four-year matriculation period, plus the loan's maximum applicable grace period, if any. For all other loans, the creditor may assume that the consumer defers for a two-year matriculation period, plus the maximum applicable grace period, if any, or the maximum time the consumer may defer payments under the loan program, whichever is shorter.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Alternatively, if the creditor knows that the student will be enrolled in a program with a standard duration, the creditor may assume that the consumer defers payments for the full duration of the program (plus any grace period). For example, if a creditor makes loans intended for students enrolled in a four-year medical school degree program, the creditor may assume that the consumer defers payments for four years plus the loan's maximum applicable grace period, if any. However, the creditor may not modify the disclosure to correspond to a particular student's situation. For example, even if the creditor knows that a student will be a second-year medical school student, the creditor must assume a four-year deferral period.</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(6)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Terms of Federal student loans. The creditor must disclose the interest rates available under each program under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and whether the rates are fixed or variable, as prescribed in the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1077a). Where the fixed interest rate for a loan varies by statute depending on the date of disbursement or receipt of application, the creditor must disclose only the interest rate as of the time the disclosure is provided.</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(6)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Web site address. The creditor must include with this disclosure an appropriate U.S. Department of Education Web site address such as ``Federalstudentaid.ed.gov.''</p><p class="depth0">47(b) Approval Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(1) Interest Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable rate disclosures. The interest rate is considered variable if the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the interest rate originally disclosed to the consumer. The provisions do not apply to increases resulting from delinquency (including late payment), default, assumption, or acceleration. In addition to disclosing the information required under Sec. Sec. 226.47(b)(ii) and (iii), the creditor must disclose the information required under Sec. Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(i) and (iii)--the circumstances under which the rate may increase and the effect of an increase, respectively. The creditor is required to disclose the maximum monthly payment based on the maximum possible rate in Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(viii), and the creditor need not disclose a separate example of the payment terms that would result from an increase under Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations on rate adjustments. The creditor must disclose how often the rate may change and any limit on the amount that the rate may increase at any one time. The creditor must also disclose any maximum rate over the life of the transaction. If the legal obligation between the parties does provide a maximum rate, the creditor must disclose any legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations. However, if the applicable maximum rate is in the form of a legal limit, such as a State's usury cap (rather than a maximum rate specified in the legal obligation between the parties), the creditor must disclose that the maximum rate is determined by applicable law. Compliance with Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(ii) (requiring disclosure of any limitations on the increase of the interest rate) does not necessarily constitute compliance with this section. Specifically, this section requires that if there are no limitations on interest rate increases, the creditor must

disclose that fact. By contrast, comment 18(f)(1)(ii)-1 states that if there are no limitations the creditor need not disclose that fact. In addition, under this section, limitations on rate increases include, rather than exclude, legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rates applicable to the loan. For a variable-rate loan, the disclosure of the interest rate must reflect the index and margin that will be used to make interest rate adjustments for the loan. The creditor may provide a description of the index and margin or range of margins used to make interest rate adjustments, including a reference to a source, such as a newspaper, where the consumer may look up the index.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees and default or late payment costs. Creditors may follow the commentary for Sec. 226.47(a)(2) in complying with Sec. 226.47(b)(2). Creditors must disclose the late payment fees required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18(l) as part of the disclosure required under Sec. 226.47(b)(2)(ii). If the creditor includes the itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c)(1), any fees disclosed as part of the itemization need not be separately disclosed elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(3) Repayment Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Principal amount. The principal amount must equal what the face amount of the note would be as of the time of approval, and it must be labeled ``Total Loan Amount.'' See Appendix H-18. This amount may be different from the ``principal loan amount'' used to calculate the amount financed under comment 18(b)(3)-1, because the creditor has the option under that comment of using a ``principal loan amount'' that is different from the face amount of the note. If the creditor elects to provide an itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 226.18(c)(1) the creditor need not disclose the amount financed elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan term. The term of the loan is the maximum period of time during which regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest are due on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment deferral options applicable to the consumer. Creditors may follow the commentary for Sec. 226.47(a)(3)(ii) in complying with Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Payments required during enrollment. Required payments that must be disclosed include payments of interest and principal, interest only, or other payments that the consumer must make during the time that the student is enrolled. Compliance with Sec. 226.18(g) constitutes compliance with Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">5. Bankruptcy limitations. The creditor may comply with Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(vi) by disclosing the following statement: ``If you file for bankruptcy you may still be required to pay back this loan.''</p><p class="depth0">6. An estimate of the total amount for repayment. The creditor must disclose an estimate of the total amount for repayment at two interest rates:</p><p class="depth0">i. The interest rate in effect on the date of approval. Compliance with the total of payments disclosure requirement of Sec. 226.18(h) constitutes compliance with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The maximum possible rate of interest applicable to the loan or, if the maximum rate cannot be determined, a rate of 25%. If the legal obligation between the parties specifies a maximum rate of interest, the creditor must calculate the total amount for repayment based on that rate. If the legal obligation does not specify a maximum rate but a usury or rate ceiling under State or Federal statutes or regulations applies, the creditor must use that rate. If a there is no maximum rate in the legal obligation or under a usury or rate ceiling, the creditor must base the disclosure on a rate of 25% and must disclose that there is no maximum rate and that the total amount for repayment disclosed under Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(vii)(B) is an estimate and will be higher if the applicable interest rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If terms of the legal obligation provide a limitation on the amount that the interest rate may increase at any one time, the creditor may reflect the effect of the interest rate limitation in calculating the total cost example. For example, if the legal obligation provides that the interest rate may not increase by more than three percentage points each year, the creditor may assume that the rate increases by three percentage points each year until it reaches that maximum possible rate, or if a maximum rate cannot be determined, an interest rate of 25%.</p><p class="depth0">7. The maximum monthly payment. The creditor must disclose the maximum payment that the consumer could be required to make under the loan agreement, calculated using the maximum rate of interest applicable to the loan, or if the maximum rate cannot be determined, a rate of 25%. The creditor must determine and disclose the maximum rate of interest in accordance with comments 47(b)(3)-6.ii and 47(b)(3)-6.iii. In addition, if a maximum rate cannot be determined, the creditor must state that there is no maximum rate and that the monthly payment amounts disclosed under Sec. 226.47(b)(3)(viii) are estimates and will be higher if the applicable interest rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(4) Alternatives to Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors may use the guidance provided in the commentary for Sec. 226.47(a)(6) in complying with Sec. 226.47(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(5) Rights of the Consumer</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of acceptance period. The disclosure that the consumer may accept the terms of the loan until the acceptance period under Sec. 226.48(c)(1) has expired must include the specific date on which the acceptance period expires and state that the consumer may accept the terms of the loan until that date. Under Sec. 226.48(c)(1), the date on which the acceptance period expires is based on when the consumer receives the disclosures. If the creditor mails the disclosures, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after the creditor places the disclosures in the mail See Sec. 226.46(d)(4). If the creditor provides an acceptance period longer than the minimum 30 calendar days, the disclosure must reflect the later date. The disclosure must also specify the method or methods by which the consumer may communicate acceptance.</p><p class="depth0">47(c) Final Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of right to cancel. The disclosure of the right to cancel must include the specific date on which the three-day cancellation period expires and state that the consumer has a right to cancel by that date. See comments 48(d)-1 and 2. For example, if the disclosures were mailed to the consumer on Friday, June 1, and the consumer is deemed to receive them on Tuesday, June 5, the creditor could state: ``You have a right to cancel this transaction, without penalty, by midnight on June 8, 2009. No funds will be disbursed to you or to your school until after this time. You may cancel by calling us at 800-XXX-XXXX.'' If the creditor permits cancellation by mail, the statement must specify that the consumer's mailed request will be deemed timely if placed in the mail not later than the cancellation date specified on the disclosure. The disclosure must also specify the method or methods by which the consumer may cancel.</p><p class="depth0">2. More conspicuous. The statement of the right to cancel must be more conspicuous than any other disclosure required under this section except for the finance charge, the interest rate, and the creditor's identity. See Sec. 226.46(c)(2)(iii). The statement will be deemed to be made more conspicuous if it is segregated from other disclosures, placed near or at the top of the disclosure document, and highlighted in relation to other required disclosures. For example, the statement may be outlined with a prominent, noticeable box; printed in contrasting color; printed in larger type, bold print, or different type face; underlined; or set off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.48--Limitations on Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Co-branding--definition of marketing. The prohibition on co-branding in Sec. Sec. 226.48(a) and (b) applies to the marketing of private education loans. The term marketing includes any advertisement under Sec. 226.2(a)(2). In addition, the term marketing includes any document provided by the creditor to the consumer related to a specific transaction, such as an application or solicitation, a promissory note or a contract provided to the consumer. For example, prominently displaying the name of the educational institution at the top of the application form or promissory note without mentioning the name of the creditor, such as by naming the loan product the ``University of ABC Loan,'' would be prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">2. Implied endorsement. A suggestion that a private education loan is offered or made by the covered educational institution instead of by the creditor is included in the prohibition on implying that the covered educational institution endorses the private education loan under Sec. 226.48(a)(1). For example, naming the loan the ``University of ABC Loan,'' suggests that the loan is offered by the educational institution. However, the use of a creditor's full name, even if that name includes the name of a covered educational institution, does not imply endorsement. For example, a credit union whose name includes the name of a covered educational institution is not prohibited from using its own name. In addition, the authorized use of a state seal by a state or an institution of higher education in the marketing of state education loan products does not imply endorsement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure. i. A creditor is considered to have complied with Sec. 226.48(a)(2) if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and conspicuous statement, equally prominent and closely proximate to the reference to the covered educational institution, using the name of the creditor and the name of the covered educational institution that the covered educational institution does not endorse the creditor's loans and that the creditor is not affiliated with the covered educational institution. For example, ``[Name of creditor]'s loans are not endorsed by [name of school] and [name of creditor] is not affiliated with [name of school].'' The statement is considered to be equally prominent and closely proximate if it is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the reference to the educational institution, without any intervening text or graphical displays.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor is considered to have complied with Sec. 226.48(b) if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and conspicuous statement, equally prominent and closely proximate to the reference to the covered educational institution, using the name of the creditor's loan or loan program, the name of the covered educational institution, and the name of the creditor, that the creditor's loans are not offered or made by the

covered educational institution, but are made by the creditor. For example, ``[Name of loan or loan program] is not being offered or made by [name of school], but by [name of creditor].'' The statement is considered to be equally prominent and closely proximate if it is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the reference to the educational institution, without any intervening text or graphical displays.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 48(c)</p><p class="depth0">1. 30 day acceptance period. The creditor must provide the consumer with at least 30 calendar days from the date the consumer receives the disclosures required under Sec. 226.47(b) to accept the terms of the loan. The creditor may provide the consumer with a longer period of time. If the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are mailed under Sec. 226.46(d)(4). For purposes of determining when a consumer receives mailed disclosures, ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to in Sec. 226.2(a)(6). See comment 46(d)-1. The consumer may accept the loan at any time before the end of the 30 day period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of acceptance. The creditor must specify a method or methods by which the consumer can accept the loan at any time within the 30-day acceptance period. The creditor may require the consumer to communicate acceptance orally or in writing. Acceptance may also be communicated electronically, but electronic communication must not be the only means provided for the consumer to communicate acceptance unless the creditor has provided the approval disclosure electronically in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 et seq.). If acceptance by mail is allowed, the consumer's communication of acceptance is considered timely if placed in the mail within the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prohibition on changes to rates and terms. The prohibition on changes to the rates and terms of the loan applies to changes that affect those terms that are required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec. 226.47(b) and (c). The creditor is permitted to make changes that do not affect any of the terms disclosed to the consumer under those sections.</p><p class="depth0">4. Permissible changes to rates and terms--re-disclosure not required. Creditors are not required to consummate a loan where the extension of credit would be prohibited by law or where the creditor has reason to believe that the consumer has committed fraud. A creditor may make changes to the rate based on adjustments to the index used for the loan and changes that will unequivocally benefit the consumer. For example, a creditor is permitted to reduce the interest rate or lower the amount of a fee. A creditor may also reduce the loan amount based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has increased. A creditor may also withdraw the loan approval based on a certification or other information received from a covered educational institution or from the consumer indicating that the student is not enrolled in the institution. For these changes permitted by Sec. 226.48(c)(3), the creditor is not required to provide a new set of approval disclosures required under Sec. 226.47(b) or provide the consumer with a new 30-day acceptance period under Sec. 226.48(c)(1). The creditor must provide the final disclosures under Sec. 226.47(c).</p><p class="depth0">5. Permissible changes to rates and terms--school certification. If the creditor reduces the loan amount based on information that the student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has increased, the creditor may make certain corresponding changes to the rate and terms. The creditor may change the rate or terms to those that the consumer would have received if the consumer had applied for the reduced loan amount. For example, assume a consumer applies for, and is approved for, a $10,000 loan at a 7% interest rate. However, after the consumer receives the approval disclosures, the consumer's school certifies that the consumer's financial need is only $8,000. The creditor may reduce the loan amount for which the consumer is approved to $8,000. The creditor may also, for example, increase the interest rate on the loan to 7.125%, but only if the consumer would have received a rate of 7.125% if the consumer had originally applied for an $8,000 loan.</p><p class="depth0">5. Permissible changes to rates and terms--re-disclosure required. A creditor may make changes to the interest rate or terms to accommodate a request from a consumer. For example, assume a consumer applies for a $10,000 loan and is approved for the $10,000 amount at an interest rate of 6%. After the creditor has provided the approval disclosures, the consumer's financial need increases, and the consumer requests to a loan amount of $15,000. In this situation, the creditor is permitted to offer a $15,000 loan, and to make any other changes such as raising the interest rate to 7%, in response to the consumer's request. The creditor must provide a new set of disclosures under Sec. 226.47(b) and provide the consumer with 30 days to accept the offer under Sec. 226.48(c) for the $15,000 loan offered in response to the consumer's request. However, because the consumer may choose not to accept the offer for the $15,000 loan at the higher interest rate, the creditor may not withdraw or change the rate or

terms of the offer for the $10,000 loan, except as permitted under Sec. 226.48(c)(3), unless the consumer accepts the $15,000 loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 48(d)</p><p class="depth0">1. Right to cancel. If the creditor mails the disclosures, the disclosures are considered received by the consumer three business days after the disclosures were mailed. For purposes of determining when the consumer receives the disclosures, the term ``business day'' is defined as all calendar days except Sunday and the legal public holidays referred to in Sec. 226.2(a)(6). See Sec. 226.46(d)(4). The consumer has three business days from the date on which the disclosures are deemed received to cancel the loan. For example, if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, the disclosures are considered received on Monday, June 8. The consumer may cancel any time before midnight Thursday, June 11. The creditor may provide the consumer with more time to cancel the loan than the minimum three business days required under this section. If the creditor provides the consumer with a longer period of time in which to cancel the loan, the creditor may disburse the funds three business days after the consumer has received the disclosures required under this section, but the creditor must honor the consumer's later timely cancellation request.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of cancellation. The creditor must specify a method or methods by which the consumer may cancel. For example, the creditor may require the consumer to communicate cancellation orally or in writing. Cancellation may also be communicated electronically, but electronic communication must not be the only means by which the consumer may cancel unless the creditor provided the final disclosure electronically in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). If the creditor allows cancellation by mail, the creditor must specify an address or the name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive notice of cancellation. The creditor must wait to disburse funds until it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not canceled. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself by waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the cancellation period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice. The creditor may also satisfy itself by obtaining a written statement from the consumer, which must be provided to and signed by the consumer only at the end of the three-day period, that the right has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">3. Cancellation without penalty. The creditor may not charge the consumer a fee for exercising the right to cancel under Sec. 226.48(d). The prohibition extends only to fees charged specifically for canceling the loan. The creditor is not required to refund fees, such as an application fee, that are charged to all consumers whether or not the consumer cancels the loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 48(e)</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.48(e) requires that the creditor obtain the self-certification form, signed by the consumer, before consummating the private education loan. The rule applies only to private education loans that will be used for the postsecondary educational expenses of a student while that student is attending an institution of higher education as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(2). It does not apply to all covered educational institutions. The requirement applies even if the student is not currently attending an institution of higher education, but will use the loan proceeds for postsecondary educational expenses while attending such institution. For example, a creditor is required to obtain the form before consummating a private education loan provided to a high school senior for expenses to be incurred during the consumer's first year of college. This provision does not require that the creditor obtain the self-certification form in instances where the loan is not intended for a student attending an institution of higher education, such as when the consumer is consolidating loans after graduation. Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides that the form shall be made available to the consumer by the relevant institution of higher education. However, Sec. 226.48(e) provides flexibility to institutions of higher education and creditors as to how the completed self-certification form is provided to the lender. The creditor may receive the form directly from the consumer, or the creditor may receive the form from the consumer through the institution of higher education. In addition, the creditor may provide the form, and the information the consumer will require to complete the form, directly to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic signature. Under Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the institution of higher education may provide the self-certification form to the consumer in written or electronic form. Under Section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the form may be signed electronically by the consumer. A creditor may accept the self-certification form from the consumer in electronic form. A consumer's electronic signature is considered valid if it meets the requirements issued by the Department of Education under Section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 48(f)</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 226.48(f) does not specify the format in which creditors must provide the required information to the covered educational institution. Creditors may choose to

provide only the required information or may provide copies of the form or forms the lender uses to comply with Sec. 226.47(a). A creditor is only required to provide the required information if the creditor is aware that it is a party to a preferred lender arrangement. For example, if a creditor is placed on a covered educational institution's preferred lender list without the creditor's knowledge, the creditor is not required to comply with Sec. 226.48(f).
Subpart G--Special Rules Applicable to Credit Card Accounts and Open-End</p><p class="depth0">Credit Offered to College Students</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 226.51--Ability To Pay</p><p class="depth0">51(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">51(a)(1) Consideration of ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0">1. Consideration of additional factors. Section 226.51(a) requires a card issuer to consider a consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of an account based on the consumer's independent income or assets and current obligations. The card issuer may also consider consumer reports, credit scores, and other factors, consistent with Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).</p><p class="depth0">2. Ability to pay as of application or consideration of increase. A card issuer complies with Sec. 226.51(a) if it bases its determination regarding a consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the facts and circumstances known to the card issuer at the time the consumer applies to open the credit card account or when the card issuer considers increasing the credit line on an existing account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Credit line increase. When a card issuer considers increasing the credit line on an existing account, Sec. 226.51(a) applies whether the consideration is based upon a request of the consumer or is initiated by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">4. Income and assets. i. Sources of information. For purposes of Sec. 226.51(a), a card issuer may consider the consumer's income and assets based on</p><p class="depth0">A. Information provided by the consumer in connection with the credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan;</p><p class="depth0">B. Information provided by the consumer in connection with any other financial relationship the card issuer or its affiliates have with the consumer (subject to any applicable information-sharing rules);</p><p class="depth0">C. Information obtained through third parties (subject to any applicable information-sharing rules); and</p><p class="depth0">D. Information obtained through any empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound model that reasonably estimates a consumer's income and assets.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Income and assets of persons liable for debts incurred on account. For purposes of Sec. 226.51(a), a card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are applying for a new account and will be liable for debts incurred on that account. Similarly, when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, the card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are accountholders and are liable for debts incurred on that account. A card issuer may also consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of a cosigner or guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account. However, a card issuer may not use the income and assets of an authorized user or other person who is not liable for debts incurred on the account to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.51, unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the account an ownership interest in such income and assets. Information about current or reasonably expected income and assets includes, for example, information about current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions. Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military, or self-employment. Other sources of income could include interest or dividends, retirement benefits, public assistance, alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. A card issuer may also take into account assets such as savings accounts or investments.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Household income and assets. Consideration of information regarding a consumer's household income does not by itself satisfy the requirement in Sec. 226.51(a) to consider the consumer's independent ability to pay. For example, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their ``household income,'' the card issuer may not rely solely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.51(a). Instead, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about an applicant's independent income (such as by contacting the applicant). However, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their income without reference to household income (such as by requesting ``income'' or ``salary''), the card issuer may rely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.51(a).</p><p class="depth0">5. Current obligations. A card issuer may consider the consumer's current obligations based on information provided by the consumer or in a consumer report. In evaluating a consumer's current obligations, a card issuer need not assume that credit lines for other obligations are fully utilized.</p><p class="depth0">6. Joint applicants and joint accountholders. With respect to the opening of a joint account for two or more consumers or a credit

line increase on such an account, the card issuer may consider the collective ability of all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on the account to make the required payments.</p><p class="depth0">51(a)(2) Minimum periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicable minimum payment formula. For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in Sec. 226.51(a)(2)(ii), if the account has or may have a promotional program, such as a deferred payment or similar program, where there is no applicable minimum payment formula during the promotional period, the issuer must estimate the required minimum periodic payment based on the minimum payment formula that will apply when the promotion ends.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest rate for purchases. For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in Sec. 226.51(a)(2)(ii), if the interest rate for purchases is or may be a promotional rate, the issuer must use the post-promotional rate to estimate interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mandatory fees. For purposes of estimating required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in Sec. 226.51(a)(2)(ii), mandatory fees that must be assumed to be charged include those fees the card issuer knows the consumer will be required to pay under the terms of the account if the account is opened, such as an annual fee. If a mandatory fee is a promotional fee (as defined in Sec. 226.16(g)), the issuer must use the post-promotional fee amount for purposes of Sec. 226.51(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">51(b) Rules affecting young consumers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Age as of date of application or consideration of credit line increase. Sections 226.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) apply only to a consumer who has not attained the age of 21 as of the date of submission of the application under Sec. 226.51(b)(1) or the date the credit line increase is requested by the consumer (or if no request has been made, the date the credit line increase is considered by the card issuer) under Sec. 226.51(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Liability of cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder. Sections 226.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) require the signature or written consent of a cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder agreeing either to be secondarily liable for any debt on the account incurred by the consumer before the consumer has attained the age of 21 or to be jointly liable with the consumer for any debt on the account. Sections 226.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) do not prohibit a card issuer from also requiring the cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder to assume liability for debts incurred after the consumer has attained the age of 21, consistent with any agreement made between the parties.</p><p class="depth0">3. Authorized users exempt. If a consumer who has not attained the age of 21 is being added to another person's account as an authorized user and has no liability for debts incurred on the account, Sec. 226.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">4. Electronic application. Consistent with Sec. 226.5(a)(1)(iii), an application may be provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) in the circumstances set forth in Sec. 226.5a. The electronic submission of an application from a consumer or a consent to a credit line increase from a cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder to a card issuer would constitute a written application or consent for purposes of Sec. 226.51(b) and would not be considered a consumer disclosure for purposes of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">51(b)(1) Applications from young consumers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to Regulation B. In considering an application or credit line increase on the credit card account of a consumer who is less than 21 years old, creditors must comply with the applicable rules in Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).</p><p class="depth0">2.

In considering an application or credit line increase on the credit card account of a consumer who is less than 21 years old, creditors must comply with the applicable rules in Regulation B (12 CFR part 202).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 226.52--Limitations on Fees</p><p class="depth0">52(a) Limitations prior to account opening and during first year after account opening.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(1) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Application. The 25 percent limit in Sec. 226.52(a)(1) applies to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment from the consumer's asset account to the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card issuer). For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash advance fee that is equal to five percent of the cash advance and a late payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not received by the payment due date (which is the twenty-fifth of the month). At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account

the $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit at account opening. On February 1 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash-advance fee to the account. On March 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 226.52(a)(2) permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account. On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash advance. Section 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account. Furthermore, Sec. 225.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash advance fee from the consumer by other means.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer is required to pay $125 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit during the first year after account opening. At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge the $125 in fees to the account. However, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to make payments to the card issuer for additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account prior to account opening or during the first year after account opening. Section 226.52(a)(1) also prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to open a separate credit account with the card issuer to fund the payment of additional non-exempt fees prior to the opening of the credit card account or during the first year after the credit card account is opened.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer is required to pay a $100 fee in order to apply for a credit card account. On January 5, the card issuer approves the consumer's application, assigns the account a credit limit of $1,000, and provides the consumer with account-opening disclosures consistent with Sec. 226.6. The date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions is January 5. The consumer is required to pay $150 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit, which Sec. 226.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account on January 5. However, because the $100 application fee is subject to the 25 percent limit in Sec. 226.52(a)(1), the card issuer is prohibited from requiring the consumer to pay any additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account until January 5 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees that exceed 25 percent limit. A card issuer that charges a fee to a credit card account that exceeds the 25 percent limit complies with Sec. 226.52(a)(1) if the card issuer waives or removes the fee and any associated interest charges or credits the account for an amount equal to the fee and any associated interest charges within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the fee was charged. For example, assuming the facts in the example in comment 52(a)(1)-1.i. above, the card issuer complies with Sec. 226.52(a)(1) if the card issuer charged the $2.50 cash advance fee to the account on July 15 of year one but waived or removed the fee or credited the account for $2.50 (plus any interest charges on that $2.50) at the end of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes in credit limit during first year. i. Increases in credit limit. If a card issuer increases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees that would otherwise be prohibited (such as a fee for increasing the credit limit). For example, assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $400 and the consumer is required to pay $100 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. On July 1, the card issuer increases the credit limit for the account to $600. Section 226.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees based on the increased credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Decreases in credit limit. If a card issuer decreases the credit limit during the first year after the account is opened, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove any fees charged to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit or to credit the account for an amount equal to any fees the consumer was required to pay with respect to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit limit within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which the credit limit was reduced. For example</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $1,000 and the consumer is required to pay $250 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On July 30, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for the account to $500. Section 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove $175 in fees from the account or to credit the account for an amount equal to $175 within a reasonable amount of time but no later than August 31.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume that, on June 25 of year one, a consumer is required to pay a $75 fee in order to apply for a credit card account. At account opening on July 1 of year one, the credit limit for the account is $500 and the consumer is required to pay $50 in fees for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On February 15 of year

two, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for the account to $250. Section 226.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove fees from the account or to credit the account for an amount equal to $62.50 within a reasonable amount of time but no later than March 31 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in transactions.</p><p class="depth0">i. Methods of compliance. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. A card issuer may consider an account open for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1) on any of the following dates</p><p class="depth0">A. The date the account is first used by the consumer for a transaction (such as when an account is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services).</p><p class="depth0">B. The date the consumer complies with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of a new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity), provided that the account may be used for transactions on that date.</p><p class="depth0">C. The date that is seven days after the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 226.6, provided that the consumer may use the account for transactions after complying with any reasonable activation procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of the new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information that verifies his or her identity). If a card issuer has reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 226.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than a certain number of days after the card issuer establishes the account, the card issuer may add that number of days to the seven-day period for purposes of determining the date on which the account was opened.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services and a $500 transaction is charged to the account by the consumer. The card issuer may consider the account open on July 1 of year one for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a card issuer approves a consumer's application for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and establishes the account on its internal systems. On July 5, the card issuer mails or delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 226.6. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 12 of year one for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 12 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as in paragraph B above except that the card issuer has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 226.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than three days after an account is established on its systems. If the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July 11 of year one for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 11 of year two. However, if the consumer uses the account for a transaction or complies with the card issuer's reasonable procedures for preventing fraud or unauthorized use on July 8 of year one, the card issuer may, at its option, consider the account open on that date for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1) and Sec. 226.52(a)(1) therefore ceases to apply to the account on July 8 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(2) Fees not subject to limitations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Covered fees. Except as provided in Sec. 226.52(a)(2), Sec. 226.52(a) applies to any fees or other charges that a card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay with respect to a credit card account prior to account opening and during the first year after account opening, other than charges attributable to periodic interest rates. For example, Sec. 226.52(a) applies to</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or availability of credit described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(2), including any fee based on account activity or inactivity and any fee that a consumer is required to pay in order to receive a particular credit limit;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees for insurance described in Sec. 226.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in Sec. 226.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, if the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required by the terms of the account;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Fees that the consumer is required to pay in order to engage in transactions using the account (such as cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and fees for using the account for purchases);</p><p class="depth0">iv. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for violating the terms of the account (except to the extent specifically excluded by Sec. 226.52(a)(2)(i));</p><p class="depth0">v. Fixed finance charges; and</p><p class="depth0">vi. Minimum charges imposed if a charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic interest rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees the consumer is not required to pay. Section 226.52(a)(2)(ii) provides that Sec. 226.52(a) does not apply to fees that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account. For example, Sec. 226.52(a) generally does not apply to fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by Sec. 226.10(e)), fees for optional services (such as travel insurance), fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card, or statement reproduction fees.</p><p class="depth0">3. Security deposits. A security deposit that is charged to a credit card account is a fee for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a). In contrast, however, a security deposit is not subject to the 25 percent limit in Sec. 226.52(a)(1) if it is not charged to the account. For example, Sec. 226.52(a)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from requiring a consumer to provide funds at account opening pledged as security for the account that exceed 25 percent of the credit limit at account opening so long as those funds are not obtained from the account.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(3) Rule of construction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or charges otherwise prohibited by law. Section 226.52(a) does not authorize the imposition or payment of fees or charges otherwise prohibited by law. For example, see 16 CFR 310.4(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">52(b) Limitations on penalty fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees for violating the account terms or other requirements. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b), a fee includes any charge imposed by a card issuer based on an act or omission that violates the terms of the account or any other requirements imposed by the card issuer with respect to the account, other than charges attributable to periodic interest rates. Accordingly, for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b), a fee does not include charges attributable to an increase in an annual percentage rate based on an act or omission that violates the terms or other requirements of an account.</p><p class="depth0">i. The following are examples of fees that are subject to the limitations in Sec. 226.52(b) or are prohibited by Sec. 226.52(b)</p><p class="depth0">A. Late payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if an account becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a particular date.</p><p class="depth0">B. Returned payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if a payment received via check, automated clearing house, or other payment method is returned.</p><p class="depth0">C. Any fee or charge for an over-the-limit transaction as defined in Sec. 226.56(a), to the extent the imposition of such a fee or charge is permitted by Sec. 226.56.</p><p class="depth0">D. Any fee imposed by a card issuer if payment on a check that accesses a credit card account is declined.</p><p class="depth0">E. Any fee or charge for a transaction that the card issuer declines to authorize. See Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">F. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on account inactivity (including the consumer's failure to use the account for a particular number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular type of transaction). See Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">G. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on the closure or termination of an account. See Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The following are examples of fees to which Sec. 226.52(b) does not apply</p><p class="depth0">A. Balance transfer fees.</p><p class="depth0">B. Cash advance fees.</p><p class="depth0">C. Foreign transaction fees.</p><p class="depth0">D. Annual fees and other fees for the issuance or availability of credit described in Sec. 226.5a(b)(2), except to the extent that such fees are based on account inactivity. See Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">E. Fees for insurance described in Sec. 226.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in Sec. 226.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, provided that such fees are not imposed as a result of a violation of the account terms or other requirements of an account.</p><p class="depth0">F. Fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by Sec. 226.10(e)).</p><p class="depth0">G. Fees for optional services (such as travel insurance).</p><p class="depth0">H. Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rounding to nearest whole dollar. A card issuer may round any fee that complies with Sec. 226.52(b) to the nearest whole dollar. For example, if Sec. 226.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $21.50, the card issuer may round that amount up to the nearest whole dollar and impose a late payment fee of $22. However, if the late payment fee permitted by Sec. 226.52(b) were $21.49, the card issuer would not be permitted to round that amount up to $22, although the card issuer could round that amount down and impose a late payment fee of $21.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship between Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">i. Relationship between Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii). A card issuer may impose a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account pursuant to either Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">A. A card issuer that complies with the safe harbors in Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) is not required to determine that its fees represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of a type of violation under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer may impose a fee for one type of violation pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) and may impose a fee for a different type of

violation pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii). For example, a card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $30 based on a cost determination pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) but impose returned payment and over-the-limit fees of $25 or $35 pursuant to the safe harbors in Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer that previously based the amount of a penalty fee for a particular type of violation on a cost determination pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) may begin to impose a penalty fee for that type of violation that is consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) at any time (subject to the notice requirements in Sec. 226.9), provided that the first fee imposed pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) is consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). For example, assume that a late payment occurs on January 15 and that, based on a cost determination pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), the card issuer imposes a $30 late payment fee. Another late payment occurs on July 15. The card issuer may impose another $30 late payment fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) or may impose a $25 late payment fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, the card issuer may not impose a $35 late payment fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). If the card issuer imposes a $25 fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) for the July 15 late payment and another late payment occurs on September 15, the card issuer may impose a $35 fee for the September 15 late payment pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relationship between Sec. 226.52(b)(1) and (b)(2). Section 226.52(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to impose a fee that is inconsistent with the prohibitions in Sec. 226.52(b)(2). For example, if Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds $15, Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to impose a higher late payment fee.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1)(i) Fees based on costs.</p><p class="depth0">1. Costs incurred as a result of violations. Section 226.52(b)(1)(i) does not require a card issuer to base a fee on the costs incurred as a result of a specific violation of the terms or other requirements of an account. Instead, for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer must have determined that a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of that type of violation. A card issuer may make a single determination for all of its credit card portfolios or may make separate determinations for each portfolio. The factors relevant to this determination include</p><p class="depth0">i. The number of violations of a particular type experienced by the card issuer during a prior period of reasonable length (for example, a period of twelve months).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The costs incurred by the card issuer during that period as a result of those violations.</p><p class="depth0">iii. At the card issuer's option, the number of fees imposed by the card issuer as a result of those violations during that period that the card issuer reasonably estimates it will be unable to collect. See comment 52(b)(1)(i)-5.</p><p class="depth0">iv. At the card issuer's option, reasonable estimates for an upcoming period of changes in the number of violations of that type, the resulting costs, and the number of fees that the card issuer will be unable to collect. See illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(1)(i)-6 through -9.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts excluded from cost analysis. The following amounts are not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">i. Losses and associated costs (including the cost of holding reserves against potential losses and the cost of funding delinquent accounts).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Costs associated with evaluating whether consumers who have not violated the terms or other requirements of an account are likely to do so in the future (such as the costs associated with underwriting new accounts). However, once a violation of the terms or other requirements of an account has occurred, the costs associated with preventing additional violations for a reasonable period of time are costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Third party charges. As a general matter, amounts charged to the card issuer by a third party as a result of a violation of the terms or other requirements of an account are costs incurred by the card issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i). For example, if a card issuer is charged a specific amount by a third party for each returned payment, that amount is a cost incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments. However, if the amount is charged to the card issuer by an affiliate or subsidiary of the card issuer, the card issuer must have determined that the charge represents a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate or subsidiary as a result of the type of violation. For example, if an affiliate of a card issuer provides collection services to the card issuer on delinquent accounts, the card issuer must have determined that the amounts charged to the card issuer by the affiliate for such services represent a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate as a result of late payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amounts charged by other card issuers. The fact that a card issuer's fees for violating the terms or other requirements of an account are comparable to fees assessed by other card issuers does not satisfy the requirements of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">5. Uncollected fees. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer may consider

fees that it is unable to collect when determining the appropriate fee amount. Fees that the card issuer is unable to collect include fees imposed on accounts that have been charged off by the card issuer, fees that have been discharged in bankruptcy, and fees that the card issuer is required to waive in order to comply with a legal requirement (such as a requirement imposed by 12 CFR part 226 or 50 U.S.C. app. 527). However, fees that the card issuer chooses not to impose or chooses not to collect (such as fees the card issuer chooses to waive at the request of the consumer or under a workout or temporary hardship arrangement) are not relevant for purposes of this determination. See illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(2)(i)-6 through -9.</p><p class="depth0">6. Late payment fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of late payments. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of late payments include the costs associated with the collection of late payments, such as the costs associated with notifying consumers of delinquencies and resolving delinquencies (including the establishment of workout and temporary hardship arrangements).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">A. Late payment fee based on past delinquencies and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 1 million delinquencies and incurred $26 million in costs as a result of those delinquencies. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $26 late payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a late payment fee for each of the 1 million delinquencies experienced during year one but was unable to collect 25% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 250,000 fees, leaving a total of 750,000 late payments for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), a late payment fee of $35 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that--based on past delinquency rates and other factors relevant to potential delinquency rates for year two--it will experience a 2% decrease in delinquencies during year two (in other words, 20,000 fewer delinquencies for a total of 980,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees (25%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 245,000 fees, leaving a total of 735,000 late payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of delinquencies and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two--it will experience a 5% increase in costs during year two (in other words, $1.3 million in additional costs for a total of $27.3 million). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $37 late payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">7. Returned payment fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of returned payments. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of returned payments include</p><p class="depth0">A. Costs associated with processing returned payments and reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect returned payments;</p><p class="depth0">B. Costs associated with investigating potential fraud with respect to returned payments; and</p><p class="depth0">C. Costs associated with notifying the consumer of the returned payment and arranging for a new payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">A. Returned payment fee based on past returns and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 150,000 returned payments and incurred $3.1 million in costs as a result of those returned payments. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $21 returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a returned payment fee for each of the 150,000 returned payments experienced during year one but was unable to collect 15% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 22,500 fees, leaving a total of 127,500 returned payments for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), a returned payment fee of $24 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that--based on past returned payment rates and other factors relevant to potential returned payment rates for year two--it will experience a 2% increase in returned payments during year two (in other words, 3,000 additional returned payments for a total of 153,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect 25% of returned payment fees during year two (in other words, the

card issuer will be unable to collect 38,250 fees, leaving a total of 114,750 returned payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of returned payments and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two--it will experience a 1% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $31,000 reduction in costs for a total of $3.069 million). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $27 returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">8. Over-the-limit fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions.

Costs associated with notifying the consumer that the credit limit has been exceeded and arranging for payments to reduce the balance below the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Costs not incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), costs associated with obtaining the affirmative consent of consumers to the card issuer's payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit consistent with Sec. 226.56 are not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">A. Over-the-limit fee based on past fees and costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer authorized 600,000 over-the-limit transactions and incurred $4.5 million in costs as a result of those over-the-limit transactions. However, because of the affirmative consent requirements in Sec. 226.56, the card issuer was only permitted to impose 200,000 over-the-limit fees during year one. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $23 over-the-limit fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same facts as above except that the card issuer was unable to collect 30% of the 200,000 over-the-limit fees imposed during year one (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of 140,000 over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), an over-the-limit fee of $32 would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same facts as paragraphs A. and B. above except the card issuer reasonably estimates that--based on past over-the-limit transaction rates, the percentages of over-the-limit transactions that resulted in an over-the-limit fee in the past (consistent with Sec. 226.56), and factors relevant to potential changes in those rates and percentages for year two--it will authorize approximately the same number of over-the-limit transactions during year two (600,000) and impose approximately the same number of over-the-limit fees (200,000). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees (30%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of 140,000 over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer will be able to collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on past changes in costs incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions and other factors relevant to potential costs for year two--it will experience a 6% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $270,000 reduction in costs for a total of $4.23 million). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $30 over-the-limit fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">9. Declined access check fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of declined access checks. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of declining payment on a check that accesses a credit card account include</p><p class="depth0">A. Costs associated with determining whether to decline payment on access checks;</p><p class="depth0">B. Costs associated with processing declined access checks and reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect declined access checks;</p><p class="depth0">C.

Costs associated with notifying the consumer and the merchant or other party that accepted the access check that payment on the check has been declined.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer declined 100,000 access checks and incurred $2 million in costs as a result of those declined checks. The card issuer imposed a fee for each declined access check but was unable to collect 10% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer was unable to collect 10,000 fees, leaving a total of 90,000 declined access checks for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i), a $22 declined access check fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of declined access checks during year two.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1)(ii) Safe harbors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple violations of same type.</p><p class="depth0">i. Same billing cycle or next six billing cycles. A card issuer cannot impose a fee for a violation pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) unless a fee has previously been imposed for the same type of violation pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). Once a fee has been imposed for a violation pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer may impose a fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) for any subsequent violation of the same type until that type of violation has not occurred for a period of six consecutive complete billing cycles. A fee has been imposed for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) even if the card issuer waives or rebates all or part of the fee.</p><p class="depth0">A. Late payments. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a late payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment may first be treated as late consistent with the requirements of 12 CFR Part 226 and the terms or other requirements of the account.</p><p class="depth0">B. Returned payments. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a returned payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment is returned to the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">C.

For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a transaction that exceeds the credit limit for an account occurs during the billing cycle in which the transaction occurs or is authorized by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">D. Declined access checks. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), a check that accesses a credit card account is declined during the billing cycle in which the card issuer declines payment on the check.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relationship to Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) and 226.56(j)(1). If multiple violations are based on the same event or transaction such that Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing more than one fee, the event or transaction constitutes a single violation for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii). Furthermore, consistent with Sec. 226.56(j)(1)(i), no more than one violation for exceeding an account's credit limit can occur during a single billing cycle for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii). However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the same over-the-limit transaction to the extent permitted by Sec. 226.56(j)(1). In these circumstances, the second and third over-the-limit fees permitted by Sec. 226.56(j)(1) may be imposed pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are not charge card accounts. For purposes of these examples, assume that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.</p><p class="depth0">A. Violations of same type (late payments). A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on March 25. On March 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on March 26. In order for the card issuer to impose a $35 late payment fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), a second late payment must occur during the April, May, June, July, August, or September billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The card issuer does not receive any payment during the March billing cycle. A required minimum periodic payment of $100 is due on April 25. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. No further payment is received during the April billing cycle. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26. Furthermore, the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee for any late payment that occurs during the May, June, July, August, September, or October billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Same facts as in paragraph A. above. On March 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment and the required minimum periodic payments for the April, May, June, July, August, and September billing cycles are received on or before the payment due date. A required minimum periodic payment of $60 is due on October 25. On October 26, a late payment has occurred because the required minimum periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. However, because this late payment did not occur during the six billing cycles following the March billing cycle, Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) only permits the card issuer to impose a late payment fee of $25.</p><p class="depth0">B. Violations of different types (late payment and over the credit limit). The credit limit for an account is $1,000. Consistent with Sec. 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. A required minimum periodic payment of $30 is due on August 25. On August 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on August 26. On August 30, the card issuer receives a $30 payment. On September 10, a transaction causes the account balance to increase to $1,150, which exceeds the account's $1,000 credit limit. On September 11, a second transaction increases the account balance to $1,350. On September 23, the card issuer receives the $50 required minimum periodic payment due on September 25, which reduces the account balance to $1,300. On September 30, the card issuer imposes a $25 over-the-limit fee, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On October 26, a late payment has occurred because the $60 required

minimum periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer imposes a $35 late payment fee on October 26.</p><p class="depth0">C. Violations of different types (late payment and returned payment). A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 25. On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26. On July 30, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on August 25. On August 24, a $50 payment is received. On August 27, the $50 payment is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. In these circumstances, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) permits the card issuer to impose either a late payment fee or a returned payment fee but not both because the late payment and the returned payment result from the same event or transaction. Accordingly, for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii), the event or transaction constitutes a single violation. However, if the card issuer imposes a late payment fee, Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) permits the issuer to impose a fee of $35 because the late payment occurred during the six billing cycles following the July billing cycle. In contrast, if the card issuer imposes a returned payment fee, the amount of the fee may be no more than $25 pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustments based on Consumer Price Index. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), the Board shall calculate each year price level adjusted amounts using the Consumer Price Index in effect on June 1 of that year. When the cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has risen by a whole dollar, those amounts will be increased by $1.00. Similarly, when the cumulative change in the adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price level to the current amounts in Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) has decreased by a whole dollar, those amounts will be decreased by $1.00. The Board will publish adjustments to the amounts in Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">3. Delinquent balance for charge card accounts. Section 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) provides that, when a charge card issuer that requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each billing cycle has not received the required payment for two or more consecutive billing cycles, the card issuer may impose a late payment fee that does not exceed three percent of the delinquent balance. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the delinquent balance is any previously billed amount that remains unpaid at the time the late payment fee is imposed pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C). Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii), a charge card issuer that imposes a fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) with respect to a late payment may not impose a fee pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to the same late payment. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a charge card issuer requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each billing cycle and that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. At the end of the June billing cycle, the account has a balance of $1,000. On July 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,000 balance consistent with Sec. 226.7. During the July billing cycle, the account is used for $300 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,300. At the end of the July billing cycle, no payment has been received and the card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On August 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the $1,325 balance consistent with Sec. 226.7. During the August billing cycle, the account is used for $200 in transactions, increasing the balance to $1,525. At the end of the August billing cycle, no payment has been received. Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $40, which is 3% of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle. Section 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) does not permit the card issuer to include the $200 in transactions that occurred during the August billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on August 25, a $100 payment is received. Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $37, which is 3% of the unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle ($1,225).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph A. above except that, on August 25, a $200 payment is received. Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $34, which is 3% of the unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle ($1,125). In the alternative, the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $35 consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2) Prohibited fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.52(b)(1). A card issuer does not comply with Sec. 226.52(b) if it imposes a fee that is inconsistent with the prohibitions in Sec. 226.52(b)(2). Thus, the prohibitions in Sec. 226.52(b)(2) apply even if a fee is consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii). For example, even if a card issuer has determined for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) that a

$27 fee represents a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of a particular type of violation, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the violation is less than $27. Similarly, even if Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii) permits a card issuer to impose a $25 fee, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the violation is less than $25.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2)(i) Fees that exceed dollar amount associated with violation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment fees. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with a late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to assessment of the late payment fee. Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds the amount of that required minimum periodic payment. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on September 25. The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before September 25. On September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on September 25 ($15). Thus, under Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on September 25, the card issuer receives a $10 payment. No further payments are received. On September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the full amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on September 25 ($15), rather than the unpaid portion of that payment ($5). Thus, under Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of the late payment fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on October 28 and the billing cycle for the account closes on October 31. The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before November 3. On November 3, the card issuer determines that the required minimum periodic payment due on November 28 is $50. On November 5, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on October 28 ($15), rather than the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on November 28 ($50). Thus, under Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">2. Returned payment fees. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with a returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to the date on which the payment is returned to the card issuer. Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds the amount of that required minimum periodic payment. However, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again for payment by the card issuer, there is no additional dollar amount associated with a subsequent return of that payment and Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional returned payment fee. For example</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on March 25. The card issuer receives a check for $100 on March 23, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on March 26. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 ($15). Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)). Furthermore, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in these circumstances.

Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)). Furthermore, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in these circumstances. See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as paragraph i. above except that, on March 28, the card issuer presents the $100 check for payment a second time. On April 1, the check is again returned for insufficient funds.

Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on August 25. The card issuer receives a check for $15 on August 23, which is not returned. The card issuer receives a check for $50 on September 5, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on September 7. Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee in these circumstances. Instead, for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 ($15). Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">3. Over-the-limit fees. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit for an account is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the billing cycle in which the over-the-limit fee is imposed. Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds that amount. Nothing in Sec. 226.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose an over-the-limit fee if imposition of the fee is inconsistent with Sec. 226.56. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) to over-the-limit fees</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account with a credit limit of $5,000 begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. Assume also that, consistent with Sec. 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 1, the account has a $4,950 balance. On March 6, a $60 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,010. On March 25, a $5 transaction is charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,015. On the last day of the billing cycle (March 31), the card issuer imposes an over-the-limit fee. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 226.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on March 26, the card issuer receives a payment of $20, reducing the balance below the credit limit to $4,995. Nevertheless, for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $15.</p><p class="depth0">4. Declined access check fees. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with declining payment on a check that accesses a credit card account is the amount of the check. Thus, when a check that accesses a credit card account is declined, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds the amount of that check. For example, assume that a check that accesses a credit card account is used as payment for a $50 transaction, but payment on the check is declined by the card issuer because the transaction would have exceeded the credit limit for the account. For purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the declined check is the amount of the check ($50). Thus, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a fee that exceeds $50. However, the amount of this fee must also comply with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">5. Inactivity fees. Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan based on inactivity on that account (including the consumer's failure to use the account for a particular number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular type of transaction). For example, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 fee when a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is not used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year. Similarly, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 annual fee on all accounts of a particular type but waiving the fee on any account that is used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year if the card issuer promotes the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e). However, if the card issuer does not promote the waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e), Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) does not prohibit a card issuer from considering account activity along with other factors when deciding whether to waive or rebate annual fees on individual accounts (such as in response to a consumer's request).</p><p class="depth0">6. Closed account fees. Section 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee based on the closure or termination of an account. For example, 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) prohibits a card issuer from</p><p class="depth0">i. Imposing a one-time fee to consumers who close their accounts.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Imposing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee, a monthly maintenance fee, or a

closed account fee) after an account is closed or terminated if that fee was not imposed prior to closure or termination. This prohibition applies even if the fee was disclosed prior to closure or termination. See also comment 55(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Increasing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee or a monthly maintenance fee) after an account is closed or terminated. However, a card issuer is not prohibited from continuing to impose a periodic fee that was imposed before the account was closed or terminated.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2)(ii) Multiple fees based on single event or transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Single event or transaction. Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits a card issuer from imposing more than one fee for violating the terms or other requirements of an account based on a single event or transaction. If Sec. 226.56(j)(1) permits a card issuer to impose fees for exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the same over-the-limit transaction, those fees are not based on a single event or transaction for purposes of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii). The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii). Assume for purposes of these examples that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $20. On March 26, the card issuer has not received any payment and imposes a late payment fee. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $20 late payment fee on March 26. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an additional late payment fee if the $20 minimum payment has not been received by a subsequent date (such as March 31).</p><p class="depth0">A. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $70 required minimum periodic payment is due on April 25. This minimum payment includes the $20 minimum payment due on March 25 and the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $70 required minimum periodic payment on or before April 25. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $35 late payment fee on April 26.</p><p class="depth0">B. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $20 required minimum periodic payment is due on April 25. This minimum payment does not include the $20 minimum payment due on March 25 or the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received during the April billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 and because Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the $20 minimum payment due on March 25, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $30.</p><p class="depth0">A. On March 25, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as paragraph ii.A. above except that that card issuer receives the $50 check on March 27 and the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 29. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. If no payment is received on or before the next payment due date (April 25), Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on July 25 is $30. On July 10, the card issuer receives a $50 payment, which is not returned. On July 20, the card issuer receives a $100 payment, which is returned for insufficient funds on July 24. Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25. Nothing in Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the imposition of this fee.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $1,000 and that, consistent with Sec. 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 31, the balance on the account is $970 and the card issuer has not received the $35 required minimum periodic payment due on March 25. On that same date (March 31), a $70 transaction is charged to the account, which increases the balance to $1,040. Consistent with Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 and an over-the-limit fee of $25. Section 226.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the imposition of both fees because those fees are based

on different events or transactions. No additional transactions are charged to the account during the March, April, or May billing cycles. If the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on April 26, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.56(j)(1). Furthermore, if the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on May 26, the card issuer may again impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.56(j)(1). Thereafter, Sec. 226.56(j)(1) does not permit the card issuer to impose additional over-the-limit fees unless another over-the-limit transaction occurs. However, if an over-the-limit transaction occurs during the six billing cycles following the May billing cycle, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $5,000 and that, consistent with Sec. 226.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On July 23, the balance on the account is $4,950. On July 24, the card issuer receives the $100 required minimum periodic payment due on July 25, reducing the balance to $4,850. On July 26, a $75 transaction is charged to the account, which increases the balance to $4,925. On July 27, the $100 payment is returned for insufficient funds, increasing the balance to $5,025. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25 or an over-the-limit fee of $25. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 is $50. On March 20, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 22. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25. On March 25, the card issuer receives a second check for $50, but the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), (b)(1)(ii)(B), and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $35. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on February 25 is $100. On February 25, the card issuer receives a check for $100. On March 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing that a $120 required minimum periodic payment is due on March 25. On March 4, the $100 check is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25 with respect to the $100 payment. However, Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. On March 20, the card issuer receives a $120 check, which is not returned. No additional payments are received during the March billing cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25 and because Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second fee based on the $100 payment that was returned for insufficient funds, the card issuer cannot impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.53--Allocation of Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Required minimum periodic payment. Section 226.53 addresses the allocation of amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum periodic payment required by the card issuer. Section 226.53 does not limit or otherwise address the card issuer's ability to determine, consistent with applicable law and regulatory guidance, the amount of the required minimum periodic payment or how that payment is allocated. A card issuer may, but is not required to, allocate the required minimum periodic payment consistent with the requirements in Sec. 226.53 to the extent consistent with other applicable law or regulatory guidance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicable rates and balances. Section 226.53 permits a card issuer to allocate an amount paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment based on the annual percentage rates and balances on the day the preceding billing cycle ends, on the day the payment is credited to the account, or on any day in between those two dates. The day used by the card issuer to determine the applicable annual percentage rates and balances for purposes of Sec. 226.53 generally must be consistent from billing cycle to billing cycle, although the card issuer may adjust this day from time to time. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account start on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On the date the March billing cycle ends (March 31), the account has a purchase balance of $500 at a promotional annual percentage rate of 5% and another purchase balance of $200 at a non-promotional annual percentage rate of 15%. On April 5, a $100 purchase to which the 15% rate applies is charged to the account. On April 15, the promotional rate expires and Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to the $500 balance from 5% to 18%. On April 25, the card issuer credits to the account $400

paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. If the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the last day of the prior billing cycle, the card issuer would allocate the $400 payment to pay in full the $200 balance to which the 15% rate applied on March 31 and then allocate the remaining $200 to the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31. In the alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the account, the card issuer would allocate the $400 payment to the $500 balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on April 25, the card issuer credits to the account $750 paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. If the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the last day of the prior billing cycle, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to pay in full the $200 balance to which the 15% rate applied on March 31 and the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31 and then allocate the remaining $50 to the $100 purchase made on April 5. In the alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the account, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to pay in full the $500 balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25 and then allocate the remaining $250 to the $300 balance to which the 15% rate applied on April 25.</p><p class="depth0">3. Claims or defenses under Sec. 226.12(c) and billing error disputes under Sec. 226.13. When a consumer has asserted a claim or defense against the card issuer pursuant to Sec. 226.12(c) or alleged a billing error under Sec. 226.13, the card issuer must apply the consumer's payment in a manner that avoids or minimizes any reduction in the amount subject to that claim, defense, or dispute. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a credit card account has a $500 cash advance balance at an annual percentage rate of 25% and a $1,000 purchase balance at an annual percentage rate of 17%. Assume also that $200 of the cash advance balance is subject to a claim or defense under Sec. 226.12(c) or a billing error dispute under Sec. 226.13. If the consumer pays $900 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the card issuer must allocate $300 of the excess payment to pay in full the portion of the cash advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or dispute and then allocate the remaining $600 to the $1,000 purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that the consumer pays $1,400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer must allocate $1,300 of the excess payment to pay in full the $300 cash advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or dispute and the $1,000 purchase balance. If there are no new transactions or other amounts to which the remaining $100 can be allocated, the card issuer may apply that amount to the $200 cash advance balance that is subject to the claim, defense, or dispute. However, if the card issuer subsequently determines that a billing error occurred as asserted by the consumer, the card issuer must credit the account for the disputed amount and any related finance or other charges and send a correction notice consistent with Sec. 226.13(e).</p><p class="depth0">4. Balances with the same rate. When the same annual percentage rate applies to more than one balance on an account and a different annual percentage rate applies to at least one other balance on that account, Sec. 226.53 generally does not require that any particular method be used when allocating among the balances with the same annual percentage rate. Under these circumstances, a card issuer may treat the balances with the same rate as a single balance or separate balances. See example in comment 53-5.iv. However, when a balance on a credit card account is subject to a deferred interest or similar program that provides that a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on the balance if the balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time, that balance must be treated as a balance with an annual percentage rate of zero for purposes of Sec. 226.53 during that period of time. For example, if an account has a $1,000 purchase balance and a $2,000 balance that is subject to a deferred interest program that expires on July 1 and a 15% annual percentage rate applies to both, the balances must be treated as balances with different rates for purposes of Sec. 226.53 until July 1. In addition, unless the card issuer allocates amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the consumer pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii), Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to apply any excess payments first to the $1,000 purchase balance except during the last two billing cycles of the deferred interest period (when it must be applied first to any remaining portion of the $2,000 balance). See example in comment 53-5.v.</p><p class="depth0">5. Examples. For purposes of the following examples, assume that none of the required minimum periodic payment is allocated to the balances discussed (unless otherwise stated).</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and that the consumer pays $800 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under Sec. 226.53(a), the card issuer must

allocate $500 to pay off the cash advance balance and then allocate the remaining $300 to the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and that the consumer pays $400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under Sec. 226.53(a), the card issuer must allocate the entire $400 to the cash advance balance.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $100 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $300 at an annual percentage rate of 18%, and a $600 protected balance on which the 12% annual percentage rate cannot be increased pursuant to Sec. 226.55. If the consumer pays $500 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, Sec. 226.53(a) requires the card issuer to allocate $100 to pay off the cash advance balance, $300 to pay off the purchase balance, and $100 to the protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $1,000 at an annual percentage rate of 15%, and a transferred balance of $2,000 that was previously at a discounted annual percentage rate of 5% but is now at an annual percentage rate of 15%. Assume also that the consumer pays $800 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under Sec. 226.53(a), the card issuer must allocate $500 to pay off the cash advance balance and allocate the remaining $300 among the purchase balance and the transferred balance in the manner the card issuer deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that on January 1 a consumer uses a credit card account to make a $1,200 purchase subject to a deferred interest program under which interest accrues at an annual percentage rate of 15% but the consumer will not be obligated to pay that interest if the balance is paid in full on or before June 30. The billing cycles for this account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. Each month from January through June, the consumer uses the account to make $200 in purchases that are not subject to the deferred interest program but are subject to the 15% rate</p><p class="depth0">A. Each month from February through June, the consumer pays $400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment on the payment due date, which is the twenty-fifth of the month. Any interest that accrues on the purchases not subject to the deferred interest program is paid by the required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer does not accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii). Thus, Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payments received on February 25, March 25, and April 25 consistent with Sec. 226.53(a). In other words, the card issuer must allocate those payments as follows: $200 to pay off the balance not subject to the deferred interest program (which is subject to the 15% rate) and the remaining $200 to the deferred interest balance (which is treated as a balance with a rate of zero). However, Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the entire $400 excess payment received on May 25 to the deferred interest balance. Similarly, Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payment received on June 25 as follows: $200 to the deferred interest balance (which pays that balance in full) and the remaining $200 to the balance not subject to the deferred interest program.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above, except that the card issuer does accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii). In addition, on April 25, the card issuer receives an excess payment of $800, which the consumer requests be allocated to pay off the $800 balance subject to the deferred interest program. Section 226.53(b)(1)(ii) permits the card issuer to allocate the $800 excess payment in the manner requested by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">53(b) Special rules.</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest and similar programs. Section 226.53(b)(1) applies to deferred interest or similar programs under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. For purposes of Sec. 226.53(b)(1), ``deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. Section 226.53(b)(1) applies regardless of whether the consumer is required to make payments with respect to that balance during the specified period. However, a grace period during which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate is not a deferred interest or similar program for purposes of Sec. 226.53(b)(1). Similarly, a temporary annual percentage rate of zero percent that applies for a specified period of time consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1) is not a deferred interest or similar program for purposes of Sec. 226.53(b)(1) unless the consumer may be obligated to pay interest that accrues during the period if a balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Expiration of deferred interest or similar program during billing cycle. For purposes of Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i), a billing cycle does not constitute one of the two billing cycles immediately preceding expiration of a deferred interest or similar program if the expiration date for the program precedes the payment due date in that billing cycle. For example, assume that a credit card account has a balance subject to a deferred interest program

that expires on June 15. Assume also that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the required minimum periodic payment is due on the twenty-fifth day of the month. The card issuer does not accept requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii). Because the expiration date for the deferred interest program (June 15) precedes the due date in the June billing cycle (June 25), Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to allocate first to the deferred interest balance any amount paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment during the April and May billing cycles (as well as any amount paid by the consumer before June 15). However, if the deferred interest program expired on June 25 or on June 30 (or on any day in between), Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(i) would apply only to the May and June billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">3. Consumer requests. i. Generally. Section 226.53(b) does not require a card issuer to allocate amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the consumer, provided that the card issuer instead allocates such amounts consistent with Sec. 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable. For example, a card issuer may decline consumer requests regarding payment allocation as a general matter or may decline such requests when a consumer does not comply with requirements set by the card issuer (such as submitting the request in writing or submitting the request prior to or contemporaneously with submission of the payment), provided that amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment are allocated consistent with Sec. 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable. Similarly, a card issuer that accepts requests pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate amounts paid by a consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment consistent with Sec. 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer does not submit a request. Furthermore, a card issuer that accepts requests pursuant to Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate consistent with Sec. 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer submits a request with which the card issuer cannot comply (such as a request that contains a mathematical error), unless the consumer submits an additional request with which the card issuer can comply.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of consumer requests that satisfy Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2). A consumer has made a request for purposes of Sec. 226.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) if</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer contacts the card issuer orally, electronically, or in writing and specifically requests that a payment or payments be allocated in a particular manner during the period of time that the deferred interest or similar program applies to a balance on the account or the period of time that a balance on the account is secured.</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer completes and submits to the card issuer a form or payment coupon provided by the card issuer for the purpose of requesting that a payment or payments be allocated in a particular manner during the period of time that the deferred interest or similar program applies to a balance on the account or the period of time that a balance on the account is secured.</p><p class="depth0">C. The consumer contacts the card issuer orally, electronically, or in writing and specifically requests that a payment that the card issuer has previously allocated consistent with Sec. 226.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, instead be allocated in a different manner.</p><p class="depth0">iii.

Eligibility for grace period. Section 226.54 prohibits the imposition of finance charges as a result of the loss of a grace period in certain specified circumstances. Section 226.54 does not require the card issuer to provide a grace period. Furthermore, Sec. 226.54 does not prohibit the card issuer from placing limitations and conditions on a grace period (such as limiting application of the grace period to certain types of transactions

or conditioning eligibility for the grace period on certain transactions being paid in full by a particular date), provided that such limitations and conditions are consistent with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec. 226.54. Finally, Sec. 226.54 does not limit the imposition of finance charges with respect to a transaction when the consumer is not eligible for a grace period on that transaction at the end of the billing cycle in which the transaction occurred. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes of this example, the June billing cycle), the grace period applies from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle (July 25), subject to two conditions. First, the purchase balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May billing cycle) must have been paid in full by the payment due date in the current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). Finally, assume that the consumer was eligible for a grace period at the start of the June billing cycle (in other words, assume that the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25).</p><p class="depth0">A. If the consumer pays the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, then at the end of the June billing cycle the consumer is eligible for a grace period with respect to purchases made during that billing cycle. Therefore, Sec. 226.54 limits the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle if the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for the June billing cycle in full by July 25. Specifically, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, then the consumer is not eligible for a grace period with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle at the end of that cycle. Therefore, Sec. 226.54 does not limit the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle regardless of whether the consumer pays the purchase balance for the June billing cycle in full by July 25.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that the card issuer places only one condition on the provision of a grace period for purchases made during the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle): that the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). In these circumstances, Sec. 226.54 applies to the same extent as discussed in paragraphs i.A. and i.B. above regardless of whether the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25.</p><p class="depth0">2. Definition of grace period. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 226.54, a grace period is a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate. The following are not grace periods for purposes of Sec. 226.54:</p><p class="depth0">i. Deferred interest and similar programs. A deferred interest or similar promotional program under which a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time is not a grace period for purposes of Sec. 226.54. Thus, Sec. 226.54 does not prohibit the card issuer from charging accrued interest to an account upon expiration of a deferred interest or similar program if the balance was not paid in full prior to expiration (to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law and regulatory guidance).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Waivers or rebates of interest. As a general matter, a card issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to transactions for purposes of Sec. 226.54 if, on an individualized basis (such as in response to a consumer's request), the card issuer waives or rebates finance charges that have accrued on transactions. In addition, when a balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle is paid in full on or before the payment due date in the current billing cycle, a card issuer that waives or rebates trailing or residual interest accrued on that balance or any other transactions during the current billing cycle has not provided a grace period with respect to that balance or any other transactions for purposes of Sec. 226.54. However, if the terms of the account provide that all interest accrued on transactions will be waived or rebated if the balance for those transactions at the end of the billing cycle during which the transactions occurred is paid in full by the following payment due date, the card issuer is providing a grace period with respect to those transactions for purposes of Sec. 226.54. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. On March 31, the balance on the account is $1,000 and the consumer is not eligible for a grace period

with respect to that balance because the balance at the end of the prior billing cycle was not paid in full on March 25. On April 15, the consumer uses the account for a $500 purchase. On April 25, the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000. On May 3, the card issuer mails or delivers a periodic statement reflecting trailing or residual interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance from April 1 through April 24 as well as interest that accrued on the $500 purchase from April 15 through April 30. On May 10, the consumer requests that the trailing or residual interest charges be waived and the card issuer complies. By waiving these interest charges, the card issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as in paragraph ii.A. above except that the terms of the account state that trailing or residual interest will be waived in these circumstances or it is the card issuer's practice to waive trailing or residual interest in these circumstances. By waiving these interest charges, the card issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">C. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes of this example, the June billing cycle), the terms of the account provide that interest accrued on those purchases from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle (July 25) will be waived or rebated, subject to two conditions. First, the purchase balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May billing cycle) must have been paid in full by the payment due date in the current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). Under these circumstances, the card issuer is providing a grace period on purchases for purposes of Sec. 226.54. Therefore, assuming that the consumer was eligible for this grace period at the start of the June billing cycle (in other words, assuming that the purchase balance for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25) and assuming that the consumer pays the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25, Sec. 226.54 applies to the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the June billing cycle. Specifically, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to payment allocation requirements in Sec. 226.53. Card issuers must comply with the payment allocation requirements in Sec. 226.53 even if doing so will result in the loss of a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prohibition on two-cycle balance computation method. When a consumer ceases to be eligible for a grace period, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from computing the finance charge using the two-cycle average daily balance computation method. This method calculates the finance charge using a balance that is the sum of the average daily balances for two billing cycles. The first balance is for the current billing cycle, and is calculated by adding the total balance (including or excluding new purchases and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. The second balance is for the preceding billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">5. Prohibition on imposing finance charges on amounts paid within grace period. When a balance on a credit card account is eligible for a grace period and the card issuer receives payment for some but not all of that balance prior to the expiration of the grace period, Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges on the portion of the balance paid. Card issuers are not required to use a particular method to comply with Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii). However, when Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) applies, a card issuer is in compliance if, for example, it applies the consumer's payment to the balance subject to the grace period at the end of the preceding billing cycle (in a manner consistent with the payment allocation requirements in Sec. 226.53) and then calculates interest charges based on the amount of the balance that remains unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples. Assume that the annual percentage rate for purchases on a credit card account is 15%. The billing cycle starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day of the month. The payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month. For purchases made during the current billing cycle, the card issuer provides a grace period from the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle, provided that the purchase balance at the end of the current billing cycle is paid in full by the following payment due date. For purposes of this example, assume that none of the required minimum periodic payment is allocated to the balances discussed. During the March billing cycle, the following transactions are charged to the account: A $100 purchase on March 10, a $200 purchase on March 15, and a $300 purchase on March 20. On March 25, the purchase balance

for the February billing cycle is paid in full. Thus, for purposes of Sec. 226.54, the consumer is eligible for a grace period on the March purchases. At the end of the March billing cycle (March 31), the consumer's total purchase balance is $600 and the consumer will not be charged interest on that balance if it is paid in full by the following due date (April 25).</p><p class="depth0">i. On April 10, a $150 purchase is charged to the account. On April 25, the card issuer receives $500 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Section 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from reaching back and charging interest on any of the March transactions from the date of the transaction through the end of the March billing cycle (March 31). In these circumstances, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) by applying the $500 excess payment to the $600 purchase balance and then charging interest only on the portion of the $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($100) from the start of the April billing cycle (April 1) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 30). In addition, the card issuer may charge interest on the $150 purchase from the date of the transaction (April 10) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 31).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as in paragraph 6. above except that, on March 18, a $250 cash advance is charged to the account at an annual percentage rate of 25%. The card issuer's grace period does not apply to cash advances, but the card issuer does provide a grace period on the March purchases because the purchase balance for the February billing cycle is paid in full on March 25. On April 25, the card issuer receives $600 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. As required by Sec. 226.53, the card issuer allocates the $600 excess payment first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (the $250 cash advance balance). Although Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from charging interest on the March purchases based on days in the March billing cycle, the card issuer may charge interest on the $250 cash advance from the date of the transaction (March 18) through April 24. In these circumstances, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 226.54(a)(1)(ii) by applying the remainder of the excess payment ($350) to the $600 purchase balance and then charging interest only on the portion of the $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($250) from the start of the April billing cycle (April 1) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 30).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph 6. above except that the consumer does not pay the balance for the February billing cycle in full on March 25 and therefore is not eligible for a grace period on the March purchases. Under these circumstances, Sec. 226.54 does not apply and the card issuer may charge interest from the date of each transaction through April 24 and interest on the remaining $100 from April 25 through the end of the April billing cycle (April 25).
Section 226.55--Limitations on Increasing Annual Percentage Rates, Fees,</p><p class="depth0">and Charges</p><p class="depth0">55(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Increase in rate, fee, or charge. Section 226.55(a) prohibits card issuers from increasing an annual percentage rate or any fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on a credit card account unless specifically permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). Except as specifically provided in Sec. 226.55(b), this prohibition applies even if the circumstances under which an increase will occur are disclosed in advance. The following examples illustrate the general application of Sec. 226.55(a) and (b). Additional examples illustrating specific aspects of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b) are provided in the commentary to those exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">i. Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months, then variable rate. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases is a non-variable rate of 15% and will apply for six months. The card issuer also discloses that, after six months, the annual percentage rate for purchases will be a variable rate that is currently 18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. Furthermore, the card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for cash advances is the same variable rate that will apply to purchases after six months. Finally, the card issuer discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer makes a late payment. The payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase and cash advance balances.</p><p class="depth0">A. Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year. On January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a $2,000 purchase and a $500 cash advance. No other transactions are made on the account. At the start of each quarter, the card issuer may adjust the variable rate that applies to the $500 cash advance consistent with changes in the index (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2)). All required minimum periodic payments are received on or before the payment due date until May of year one, when the payment due on May 25 is received by the creditor on May 28. At this time, the card issuer is prohibited by Sec. 226.55 from increasing the rates that apply to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, or future purchases and cash advances. Six months after account opening (July 1), the card

issuer may begin to accrue interest on the $2,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using an 8-point margin (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). Because no other increases in rate were disclosed at account opening, the card issuer may not subsequently increase the variable rate that applies to the $2,000 purchase and the $500 cash advance (except due to increases in the index pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2)). On November 16, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same index and an increased margin of 12 percentage points). On December 15, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer may increase the margin used to determine the variable rate that applies to new purchases to 12 percentage points (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3)). However, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin to the $2,000 purchase balance. Furthermore, although the $100 purchase occurred more than 14 days after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin to that purchase because it occurred during the first year after account opening. On January 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $300 purchase. The card issuer may apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin to the $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">B. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent during first year. Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on May 25 of year one is not received by the card issuer until July 30 of year one. Because the card issuer received the required minimum periodic payment more than 60 days after the payment due date, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rate applicable to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, and future purchases and cash advances. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to first comply with the notice requirements in Sec. 226.9(g). Thus, if the card issuer provided a Sec. 226.9(g) notice on July 25 stating that all rates on the account would be increased to the 30% penalty rate, the card issuer could apply that rate beginning on September 8 to all balances and to future transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months, then increased non-variable rate for six months, then variable rate; change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases will increase as follows: A non-variable rate of 5% for six months; a non-variable rate of 10% for an additional six months; and thereafter a variable rate that is currently 15% and will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. The payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance. On January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a $1,500 purchase. Six months after account opening (July 1), the card issuer may begin to accrue interest on the $1,500 purchase at the previously-disclosed 10% non-variable rate (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). On September 15, the consumer uses the account for a $700 purchase. On November 16, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same index and an increased margin of 8 percentage points). One year after account opening (January 1 of year two), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $2,200 purchase balance at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using a 5-point margin (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin to the $2,200 purchase balance. Furthermore, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to subsequently increase the variable rate determined using the 5-point margin that applies to the $2,200 purchase balance (except due to increases in the index pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2)). The card issuer may, however, apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin to purchases made on or after January 1 of year two (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year; penalty rate increase after first year. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases is a variable rate determined by adding a margin of 6 percentage points to a publicly-available index outside of the card issuer's control. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 28% may apply if the consumer makes a late payment. The due date for the account is the fifteenth of the month. On May 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000. On May 31, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on July 16 for all purchases made on or after June 15 (calculated by using the same index and an increased margin of 8 percentage points). On June 14, the consumer makes a $500 purchase. On June 15, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 1, the card issuer has not received the payment due on June 15 and

provides the consumer with a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(g) stating that the 28% penalty rate will apply as of August 15 to all transactions made on or after July 16 and that, if the consumer becomes more than 60 days late, the penalty rate will apply to all balances on the account. On July 17, the consumer makes a $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">A. Account does not become more than 60 days delinquent. The payment due on June 15 of year two is received on July 2. On July 16, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin disclosed in the Sec. 226.9(c) notice to the $200 purchase made on June 15 but does not permit the card issuer to apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance. On August 15, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty rate disclosed at account opening and in the Sec. 226.9(g) notice to the $300 purchase made on July 17 but does not permit the card issuer to apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance (which remains at the variable rate determined using the 6-point margin) or the $200 purchase (which remains at the variable rate determined using the 8-point margin).</p><p class="depth0">B. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent after provision of Sec. 226.9(g) notice. Same facts as above except the payment due on June 15 of year two has not been received by August 15. Section 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty rate to the $1,500 purchase balance and the $200 purchase because it has not received the June 15 payment within 60 days after the due date. However, in order to do so, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to first provide an additional notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(g). This notice must be sent no earlier than August 15, which is the first day the account became more than 60 days' delinquent. If the notice is sent on August 15, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $1,500 purchase balance and the $200 purchase at the 28% penalty rate beginning on September 29.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to grace period. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from assessing interest due to the loss of a grace period to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec. 226.54. In addition, a card issuer has not reduced an annual percentage rate on a credit card account for purposes of Sec. 226.55 if the card issuer does not charge interest on a balance or a portion thereof based on a payment received prior to the expiration of a grace period. For example, if the annual percentage rate for purchases on an account is 15% but the card issuer does not charge any interest on a $500 purchase balance because that balance was paid in full prior to the expiration of the grace period, the card issuer has not reduced the 15% purchase rate to 0% for purposes of Sec. 226.55.</p><p class="depth0">55(b) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Exceptions not mutually exclusive. A card issuer generally may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to an exception set forth in Sec. 226.55(b) even if that increase would not be permitted under a different exception. For example, although a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1) unless that rate is provided for a specified period of at least six months, the card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate during a specified period due to an increase in an index consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2). Similarly, although Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate during the first year after account opening, the card issuer may increase the rate during the first year after account opening pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) if the required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days after the due date. However, if Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to decrease the rate, fee, or charge that applies to a balance while the account is subject to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or subject to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation, the card issuer may not impose a higher rate, fee, or charge on that balance pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(5) or (b)(6) upon completion or failure of the arrangement or once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar Federal or State statute or regulation no longer applies. For example, assume that, on January 1, the annual percentage rate that applies to a $1,000 balance is increased from 12% to 30% pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4). On February 1, the rate on that balance is decreased from 30% to 15% consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(5) as a part of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. On July 1, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance from 15% to 12%. If the consumer subsequently completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, the card issuer may not increase the 12% rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">55(b) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Exceptions not mutually exclusive. A card issuer generally may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to an exception set forth in Sec. 226.55(b) even if that increase would not be permitted under a different exception. For example, although a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1) unless that rate is provided for a specified period of at least six months, the card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate during a specified period due to an increase in an index consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2). Similarly, although Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does not permit a card issuer to increase an

annual percentage rate during the first year after account opening, the card issuer may increase the rate during the first year after account opening pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) if the required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days after the due date. However, if Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to decrease the rate, fee, or charge that applies to a balance while the account is subject to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or subject to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or State statute or regulation, the card issuer may not impose a higher rate, fee, or charge on that balance pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(5) or (b)(6) upon completion or failure of the arrangement or once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar Federal or State statute or regulation no longer applies. For example, assume that, on January 1, the annual percentage rate that applies to a $1,000 balance is increased from 12% to 30% pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4). On February 1, the rate on that balance is decreased from 30% to 15% consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(5) as a part of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. On July 1, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance from 15% to 12%. If the consumer subsequently completes or fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, the card issuer may not increase the 12% rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $1,000 balance pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship between exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b) and notice requirements in Sec. 226.9. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 alters the requirements in Sec. 226.9(c) and (g) that creditors provide written notice at least 45 days prior to the effective date of certain increases in annual percentage rates, fees, and charges.</p><p class="depth0">i. 14-day rule in Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii). Although Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits a card issuer that discloses an increased rate pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) to apply that rate to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of the notice, the card issuer cannot begin to accrue interest at the increased rate until that increase goes into effect, consistent with Sec. 226.9(c) or (g). For example, if on May 1 a card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) stating that a rate will increase from 15% to 18% on June 15, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to transactions that occur on or after May 16. However, neither Sec. 226.55 nor Sec. 226.9(c) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on those transactions until June 15. See additional examples in comment 55(b)(3)-4.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Mid-cycle increases; application of balance computation methods. Once an increased rate has gone into effect, the card issuer cannot calculate interest charges based on that increased rate for days prior to the effective date. Assume that, in the example in paragraph i. above, the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. If, for example, the card issuer uses the average daily balance computation method, it cannot apply the 18% rate to the average daily balance for the entire June billing cycle because that rate did not become effective until June 15. However, the card issuer could apply the 15% rate to the average daily balance from June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate to the average daily balance from June 15 through June 30. Similarly, if the card issuer that uses the daily balance computation method, it could apply the 15% rate to the daily balance for each day from June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate to the daily balance for each day from June 15 through June 30.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mid-cycle increases; delayed implementation of increase. If Sec. 226.55(b) and Sec. 226.9(b), (c), or (g) permit a card issuer to apply an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge on a date that is not the first day of a billing cycle, the card issuer may delay application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply that rate, fee, or charge. Thus, in the example in paragraphs i. and ii. above, the card issuer could delay application of the 18% rate until the start of the next billing cycle (April 1) without relinquishing its ability to apply that rate under Sec. 226.55(b)(3). Similarly, assume that, at account opening on January 1, a card issuer discloses that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for six months and a non-variable rate of 15% will apply thereafter. The first day of each billing cycle for the account is the fifteenth of the month. If the six-month period expires on July 1, the card issuer may delay application of the 15% rate until the start of the next billing cycle (July 15) without relinquishing its ability to apply that rate under Sec. 226.55(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Application of a lower rate, fee, or charge. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from lowering an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, a card issuer that does so cannot subsequently increase the rate, fee, or charge unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). The following examples illustrate the application of the rule</p><p class="depth0">i. Application of lower rate during first year. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date,

which is the tenth of the month. The required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">A. Temporary rate returns to standard rate at expiration. On September 30 of year one, the account has a purchase balance of $1,400 at the 15% rate. On October 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from October 1 through March 31 of year two) and that, beginning on April 1 of year two, the rate for purchases will increase to the 15% non-variable rate disclosed at account opening. The card issuer does not apply the 5% rate to the $1,400 purchase balance. On October 14 of year one, the consumer makes a $300 purchase at the 5% rate. On January 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $150 purchase at the 5% rate. On April 1 of year two, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $300 purchase and the $150 purchase at 15% as disclosed in the Sec. 226.9(c) notice (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalty rate increase. Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on November 10 of year one is not received until November 15. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase any annual percentage rate on the account at this time. The card issuer may apply the 30% penalty rate to new transactions beginning on April 1 of year two pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3) by providing a Sec. 226.9(g) notice informing the consumer of this increase no later than February 14 of year two. The card issuer may not, however, apply the 30% penalty rate to the $1,400 purchase balance as of September 30 of year one, the $300 purchase on October 15 of year one, or the $150 purchase on January 15 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Application of lower rate at end of first year. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases for one year and discloses that, after the first year, the card issuer will apply a variable rate that is currently 20% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. On December 31 of year one, the account has a purchase balance of $3,000.</p><p class="depth0">A. Notice of extension of existing temporary rate provided consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i). On December 15 of year one, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the existing 15% rate will continue to apply until July 1 of year two. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year two, the variable rate disclosed at account opening will apply. On July 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to apply that variable rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 balance and to new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">B. Notice of new temporary rate provided consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i). On December 15 of year one, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two that is lower than the variable rate disclosed at account opening. The new variable rate is calculated using the same index and a reduced margin of 8 percentage points. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year two, the margin will increase to the margin disclosed at account opening (10 percentage points). On July 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to increase the margin used to determine the variable rate that applies to new purchases to 10 percentage points and to apply that rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">C. No notice provided. Same facts as in paragraph ii.B. above except that the card issuer does not send a notice on December 15 of year one. Instead, on January 1 of year two, the card issuer lowers the margin used to determine the variable rate to 8 percentage points and applies that rate to the $3,000 purchase balance and to new purchases. Section 226.9 does not require advance notice in these circumstances. However, unless the account becomes more than 60 days' delinquent, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to subsequently increase the rate that applies to the $3,000 purchase balance except due to increases in the index (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Application of lower rate after first year. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for one year, after which that rate will increase to a non-variable rate of 15%. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the tenth of the month. The required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">A. Effect of 14-day period. On June 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% rate. On July 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from July 1 through December 31 of year two) and that, beginning on January 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 17%. On July 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 16, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On January 1 of year three, the card issuer

may begin accruing interest on the $100 purchase at 17% (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). However, Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(ii)(B) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 17% rate to the $200 purchase because that transaction occurred within 14 days after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice. Instead, the card issuer may apply the 15% rate that applied to purchases prior to provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice. In addition, if the card issuer applied the 5% rate to the $1,000 purchase balance, Sec. 226.55(b)(ii)(A) would not permit the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to that balance on January 1 of year three to a rate that is higher than 15% that previously applied to the balance.</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalty rate increase. Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 is received on August 30. At this time, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to increase the annual percentage rates that apply to the $1,000 purchase balance, the $200 purchase, or the $100 purchase. Instead, those rates can only be increased as discussed in paragraph iii.A. above. However, if the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) on September 1, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply an increased rate (such as the 17% purchase rate or the 30% penalty rate) to transactions that occur on or after September 16 beginning on October 16.</p><p class="depth0">C. Application of lower temporary rate during specified period. Same facts as in paragraph iii. above. On June 30 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% non-variable rate. On July 1, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance and new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 12% for six months (from July 1 through December 31 of year two) and that, beginning on January 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a variable rate that is currently 20% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. On August 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $500 purchase. On October 1, the card issuer provides another notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance, the $500 purchase, and new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months (from October 1 of year two through March 31 of year three) and that, beginning on April 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a variable rate that is currently 23% and is determined by adding a margin of 13 percentage points to the previously-disclosed index. On November 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $300 purchase. On April 1 of year three, Sec. 226.55 permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest using the following rates for any remaining portion of the following balances: The 15% non-variable rate for the $1,000 balance; the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin for the $500 purchase; and the variable rate determined using the 13-point margin for the $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date on which transaction occurred. When a transaction occurred for purposes of Sec. 226.55 is generally determined by the date of the transaction. However, if a transaction that occurred within 14 days after provision of a Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice is not charged to the account prior to the effective date of the change or increase, the card issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the notice for purposes of Sec. 226.55. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.B. In addition, when a merchant places a ``hold'' on the available credit on an account for an estimated transaction amount because the actual transaction amount will not be known until a later date, the date of the transaction for purposes of Sec. 226.55 is the date on which the card issuer receives the actual transaction amount from the merchant. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.A.</p><p class="depth0">5. Category of transactions. For purposes of Sec. 226.55, a ``category of transactions'' is a type or group of transactions to which an annual percentage rate applies that is different than the annual percentage rate that applies to other transactions. Similarly, a type or group of transactions is a ``category of transactions'' for purposes of Sec. 226.55 if a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) applies to those transactions that is different than the fee or charge that applies to other transactions. For example, purchase transactions, cash advance transactions, and balance transfer transactions are separate categories of transactions for purposes of Sec. 226.55 if a card issuer applies different annual percentage rates to each. Furthermore, if, for example, the card issuer applies different annual percentage rates to different types of purchase transactions (such as one rate for purchases of gasoline or purchases over $100 and a different rate for all other purchases), each type constitutes a separate category of transactions for purposes of Sec. 226.55.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(1) Temporary rate, fee, or charge exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B). A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Period of six months or longer. A temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge must apply for a specified period of six months or longer before a card issuer can increase that rate, fee, or charge pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1). The specified period must expire no less than six months after the date on which the card issuer provides the consumer

with the disclosures required by Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i) or, if later, the date on which the account can be used for transactions to which the temporary rate, fee, or charge applies. Section 226.55(b)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from limiting the application of a temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to a particular category of transactions (such as to balance transfers or to purchases over $100). However, in circumstances where the card issuer limits application of the temporary rate, fee, or charge to a single transaction, the specified period must expire no less than six months after the date on which that transaction occurred. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.55(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that on January 1 a card issuer offers a consumer a 5% annual percentage rate on purchases made during the months of January through June. A 15% rate will apply thereafter. On February 15, a $500 purchase is charged to the account. On June 15, a $200 purchase is charged to the account. On July 1, the card issuer may begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $500 purchase and the $200 purchase (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that on January 1 the card issuer offered the 5% rate on purchases beginning in the month of February. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $500 purchase and the $200 purchase until August 1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that on October 31 of year one the annual percentage rate for purchases is 17%. On November 1, the card issuer offers the consumer a 0% rate for six months on purchases made during the months of November and December. The 17% rate will apply thereafter. On November 15, a $500 purchase is charged to the account. On December 15, a $300 purchase is charged to the account. On January 15 of year two, a $150 purchase is charged to the account. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 17% rate on the $500 purchase and the $300 purchase until May 1 of year two. However, the card issuer may accrue interest at the 17% rate on the $150 purchase beginning on January 15 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that on June 1 of year one a card issuer offers a consumer a 0% annual percentage rate for six months on the purchase of an appliance. An 18% rate will apply thereafter. On September 1, a $5,000 transaction is charged to the account for the purchase of an appliance. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on the $5,000 transaction until March 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that on May 31 of year one the annual percentage rate for purchases is 15%. On June 1, the card issuer offers the consumer a 5% rate for six months on a balance transfer of at least $1,000. The 15% rate will apply thereafter. On June 15, a $3,000 balance is transferred to the account. On July 15, a $200 purchase is charged to the account. Section 226.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the $3,000 transferred balance until December 15. However, the card issuer may accrue interest at the 15% rate on the $200 purchase beginning on July 15.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Same facts as in paragraph v. above except that the card issuer offers the 5% rate for six months on all balance transfers of at least $1,000 during the month of June and a $2,000 balance is transferred to the account on June 30 (in addition to the $3,000 balance transfer on June 15). Because the 5% rate is not limited to a particular transaction, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest on the $3,000 and $2,000 transferred balances on December 1.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $0 until January 1 of year two, when the fee will increase to $50. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer may impose the $50 annual fee. However, the issuer must also comply with the notice requirements in Sec. 226.9(e).</p><p class="depth0">viii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the monthly maintenance fee for the account is $0 until July 1 of year one, when the fee will increase to $10. Beginning on July 1 of year one, the card issuer may impose the $10 monthly maintenance fee (to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.52(a)).</p><p class="depth0">3. Deferred interest and similar promotional programs. i. Application of Sec. 226.55. The general prohibition in Sec. 226.55(a) applies to the imposition of accrued interest upon the expiration of a deferred interest or similar promotional program under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time. However, the exception in Sec. 226.55(b)(1) also applies to these programs, provided that the specified period is six months or longer and that, prior to the commencement of the period, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the rate at which interest will accrue on the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar program if that balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period. See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-9. For purposes of Sec. 226.55, ``deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 226.16(h)(2) and associated commentary.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">A. Deferred interest offer at account opening. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, the card issuer discloses the following with respect to a deferred interest program: ``No interest on purchases made in January of year one if paid in full by December 31 of year one. If the balance is not paid in full by that date, interest will be imposed

from the transaction date at a rate of 20%.'' On January 15 of year one, the consumer makes a purchase of $2,000. No other transactions are made on the account. The terms of the deferred interest program require the consumer to make minimum periodic payments with respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment due on April 1 is not received until April 10. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account interest that has accrued on the $2,000 purchase at this time. Furthermore, if the consumer pays the $2,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of year one, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that purchase. If, however, the $2,000 purchase has not been paid in full by January 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the interest accrued on that purchase at the 20% rate during year one (to the extent consistent with other applicable law).</p><p class="depth0">B. Deferred interest offer after account opening. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the rate that applies to purchases is a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the first of the month. On June 30 of year two, the consumer uses the account for a $1,000 purchase in response to an offer of a deferred interest program. Under the terms of this program, interest on the purchase will accrue at the variable rate for purchases but the consumer will not be obligated to pay that interest if the purchase is paid in full by December 31 of year three. The terms of the deferred interest program require the consumer to make minimum periodic payments with respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment due on September 1 of year two is not received until September 6. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account interest that has accrued on the $1,000 purchase at this time. Furthermore, if the consumer pays the $1,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of year three, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that purchase. On December 31 of year three, the $1,000 purchase has been paid in full. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not charge any interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">C. Application of Sec. 226.55(b)(4) to deferred interest programs. Same facts as in paragraph ii.B. above except that, on November 2 of year two, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on September 1, October 1, or November 1 of year two and sends a Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice stating that interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two will be charged to the account on December 17 of year two and thereafter interest will be charged on the $1,000 purchase consistent with the variable rate for purchases. On December 17 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to charge to the account interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two and Sec. 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to begin charging interest on the $1,000 purchase consistent with the variable rate for purchases. However, if the card issuer receives the required minimum periodic payments due on January 1, February 1, March 1, April 1, May 1, and June 1 of year three, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to cease charging the account for interest on the $1,000 purchase no later than the first day of the next billing cycle. See comment 55(b)(4)-3.iii. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) does not require the card issuer to waive or credit the account for interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two. If the $1,000 purchase is paid in full on December 31 of year three, the card issuer is not permitted to charge to the account interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase after June 1 of year three.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contingent or discretionary increases. Section 226.55(b)(1) permits a card issuer to increase a temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge upon the expiration of a specified period of time. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to apply an increased rate, fee, or charge that is contingent on a particular event or occurrence or that may be applied at the card issuer's discretion. The following examples illustrate rate increases that are not permitted by Sec. 226.55</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies to purchases but that all rates on an account may be increased to a non-variable penalty rate of 30% if a consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth of the month. On March 1, the account has a $2,000 purchase balance. The payment due on March 15 is not received until March 20. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the 30% penalty rate to the $2,000 purchase balance. However, pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer could provide a Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice on or before November 16 informing the consumer that, on January 1 of year two, the 30% rate (or a different rate) will apply to new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one

that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 5% applies to transferred balances but that this rate will increase to a non-variable rate of 18% if the consumer does not use the account for at least $200 in purchases each billing cycle. On July 1, the consumer transfers a balance of $4,000 to the account. During the October billing cycle, the consumer uses the account for $150 in purchases. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to the $4,000 transferred balance or the $150 in purchases. However, pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer could provide a Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice on or before November 16 informing the consumer that, on January 1 of year two, the 18% rate (or a different rate) will apply to new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $10 but may be increased to $50 if a consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth of the month. The payment due on July 15 is not received until July 23. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the $50 annual fee at this time. Furthermore, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does not permit the card issuer to increase the $10 annual fee during the first year after account opening. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does permit the card issuer to impose the $50 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of year two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs the consumer of the increased fee consistent with Sec. 226.9(c) and the consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual fee for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is $0 but may be increased to $100 if the consumer's balance in a deposit account provided by the card issuer or its affiliate or subsidiary falls below $5,000. On June 1 of year one, the balance on the deposit account is $4,500. Section 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the $100 annual fee at this time. Furthermore, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does not permit the card issuer to increase the $0 annual fee during the first year after account opening. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) does permit the card issuer to impose the $100 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of year two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs the consumer of the increased fee consistent with Sec. 226.9(c) and the consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">5. Application of increased fees and charges. Section 226.55(b)(1)(ii) limits the ability of a card issuer to apply an increased fee or charge to certain transactions. However, to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(3), (c), and (d), a card issuer generally is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the account as a whole. See comments 55(c)(1)-3 and 55(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(2) Variable rate exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Increases due to increase in index. Section 226.55(b)(2) provides that an annual percentage rate that varies according to an index that is not under the card issuer's control and is available to the general public may be increased due to an increase in the index. This section does not permit a card issuer to increase the rate by changing the method used to determine a rate that varies with an index (such as by increasing the margin), even if that change will not result in an immediate increase. However, from time to time, a card issuer may change the day on which index values are measured to determine changes to the rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Index not under card issuer's control. A card issuer may increase a variable annual percentage rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2) only if the increase is based on an index or indices outside the card issuer's control. For purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(2), an index is under the card issuer's control if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The index is the card issuer's own prime rate or cost of funds. A card issuer is permitted, however, to use a published prime rate, such as that in the Wall Street Journal, even if the card issuer's own prime rate is one of several rates used to establish the published rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The variable rate is subject to a fixed minimum rate or similar requirement that does not permit the variable rate to decrease consistent with reductions in the index. A card issuer is permitted, however, to establish a fixed maximum rate that does not permit the variable rate to increase consistent with increases in an index. For example, assume that, under the terms of an account, a variable rate will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5 percentage points to a publicly-available index. When the account is opened, the index is 10% and therefore the variable rate is 15%. If the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will not decrease below 15% even if the index decreases below 10%, the card issuer cannot increase that rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(2). However, Sec. 226.55(b)(2) does not prohibit the card issuer from providing in the terms of the account that the variable rate will not increase above a certain amount (such as 20%).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The variable rate can be calculated based on any index value during a period of time (such as the 90 days preceding the last day of a billing cycle). A card issuer is permitted, however, to provide in the terms of the account that the variable rate will be calculated based on the average index value during a specified period. In the alternative, the card issuer is permitted to provide in the terms of the account that the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on a specific day (such as the last day of a

billing cycle). For example, assume that the terms of an account provide that a variable rate will be adjusted at the beginning of each quarter by adding a margin of 7 percentage points to a publicly-available index. At account opening at the beginning of the first quarter, the variable rate is 17% (based on an index value of 10%). During the first quarter, the index varies between 9.8% and 10.5% with an average value of 10.1%. On the last day of the first quarter, the index value is 10.2%. At the beginning of the second quarter, Sec. 226.55(b)(2) does not permit the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.5% based on the first quarter's maximum index value of 10.5%. However, if the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will be calculated based on the average index value during the prior quarter, Sec. 226.55(b)(2) permits the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.1% (based on the average index value of 10.1% during the first quarter). In the alternative, if the terms of the account provide that the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on the last day of the prior quarter, Sec. 226.55(b)(2) permits the card issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.2% (based on the index value of 10.2% on the last day of the first quarter).</p><p class="depth0">3. Publicly available. The index or indices must be available to the public. A publicly-available index need not be published in a newspaper, but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone, for example) and use to verify the annual percentage rate applied to the account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing a non-variable rate to a variable rate. Section 226.55 generally prohibits a card issuer from changing a non-variable annual percentage rate to a variable annual percentage rate because such a change can result in an increase. However, a card issuer may change a non-variable rate to a variable rate to the extent permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). For example, Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits a card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate upon expiration of a specified period of time. Similarly, following the first year after the account is opened, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate with respect to new transactions (after complying with the notice requirements in Sec. 226.9(b), (c) or (g)).</p><p class="depth0">5. Changing a variable rate to a non-variable rate. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from changing a variable annual percentage rate to an equal or lower non-variable rate. Whether the non-variable rate is equal to or lower than the variable rate is determined at the time the card issuer provides the notice required by Sec. 226.9(c). For example, assume that on March 1 a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 15% applies to a balance of $2,000 and the card issuer sends a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the variable rate will be converted to a non-variable rate of 14% effective April 15. On April 15, the card issuer may apply the 14% non-variable rate to the $2,000 balance and to new transactions even if the variable rate on March 2 or a later date was less than 14%.</p><p class="depth0">6. Substitution of index. A card issuer may change the index and margin used to determine the annual percentage rate under Sec. 226.55(b)(2) if the original index becomes unavailable, as long as historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices were substantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and margin will produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the time the original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newly established and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be used if it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect when the original index became unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(3) Advance notice exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.9(h). A card issuer may not increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3) if the consumer has rejected the increased fee or charge pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice provided pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b) and (c). If an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge is disclosed pursuant to both Sec. 226.9(b) and (c), that rate, fee, or charge may only be applied to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice as provided in Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Account opening.</p><p class="depth0">i. Multiple accounts with same card issuer. When a consumer has a credit card account with a card issuer and the consumer opens a new credit card account with the same card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary), the opening of the new account constitutes the opening of a credit card account for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) if, more than 30 days after the new account is opened, the consumer has the option to obtain additional extensions of credit on each account. For example, assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer opens a credit card account with a card issuer. On July 1 of year one, the consumer opens a second credit card account with that card issuer. On July 15, a $1,000 balance is transferred from the first account to the second account. The opening of the second account constitutes the opening of a credit card account for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) so long as, on August 1, the consumer has the option to engage in transactions using either account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer could not increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on the second account pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3) until July 1 of year two

(which is one year after the second account was opened).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Substitution, replacement or consolidation.</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally. A credit card account has not been opened for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) when a credit card account issued by a card issuer is substituted, replaced, or consolidated with another credit card account issued by the same card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary). Circumstances in which a credit card account has not been opened for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) include when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A retail credit card account is replaced with a cobranded general purpose credit card account that can be used at a wider number of merchants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A credit card account is replaced with another credit card account offering different features;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A credit card account is consolidated or combined with one or more other credit card accounts into a single credit card account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A credit card account acquired through merger or acquisition is replaced with a credit card account issued by the acquiring card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Limitation. A card issuer that replaces or consolidates a credit card account with another credit card account issued by the card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary) may not increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) in a manner otherwise prohibited by Sec. 226.55. For example, assume that, on January 1 of year one, a consumer opens a credit card account with an annual percentage rate of 15% for purchases. On July 1 of year one, the account is replaced with a credit card account that offers different features (such as rewards on purchases). Under these circumstances, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual percentage rate for new purchases to a rate that is higher than 15% pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3) until January 1 of year two (which is one year after the first account was opened).</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. Change-in-terms rate increase; temporary rate increase; 14-day period. Assume that an account is opened on January 1 of year one. On March 14 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15%. On March 15, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 18% on May 1. The notice further states that the 18% rate will apply for six months (until November 1) and that thereafter the card issuer will apply a variable rate that is currently 22% and is determined by adding a margin of 12 percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the card issuer's control. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is March 29 and, on that date, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On March 30, the consumer makes a $1,000 purchase. On May 1, the card issuer may begin accruing interest at 18% on the $1,000 purchase made on March 30 (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3)). Section 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to the $2,200 purchase balance as of March 29 because that balance reflects transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after the provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice. After six months (November 2), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $1,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed variable rate determined using the 12-point margin (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Checks that access an account. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual percentage rate that applies to cash advances is a variable rate that is currently 24% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 14 percentage points to a publicly available index not under the card issuer's control. On July 1 of year two, the card issuer provides checks that access the account and, pursuant to Sec. 226.9(b)(3)(i)(A), discloses that a promotional rate of 15% will apply to credit extended by use of the checks until January 1 of year three, after which the cash advance rate determined using the 14-point margin will apply. On July 9 of year two, the consumer uses one of the checks to pay for a $500 transaction. Beginning on January 1 of year three, the card issuer may apply the cash advance rate determined using the 14-point margin to any remaining portion of the $500 transaction (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Hold on available credit; 14-day period. Assume that an account is opened on January 1 of year one. On September 14 of year two, the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 17%. On September 15, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 20% on October 30. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is September 29. On September 28, the consumer uses the credit card to check into a hotel and the hotel obtains authorization for a $1,000 hold on the account to ensure there is adequate available credit to cover the anticipated cost of the stay.</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer checks out of the hotel on October 2. The actual cost of the stay is $1,100 because of additional incidental costs. On October 2, the hotel charges the $1,100 transaction to the account. For purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3), the transaction occurred on October 2. Therefore, on October 30, Sec. 226.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply the 20% rate to new purchases and to the $1,100 transaction. However, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to apply the 20% rate

to any remaining portion of the $2,000 purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above except that the consumer checks out of the hotel on September 29. The actual cost of the stay is $250, but the hotel does not charge this amount to the account until November 1. For purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3), the card issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) notice (i.e., after September 29). Accordingly, the card issuer may apply the 20% rate to the $250 transaction.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application of increased fees and charges. See comment 55(c)(1)-3.</p><p class="depth0">6. Delayed implementation of increase. Section 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not prohibit a card issuer from notifying a consumer of an increase in an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with Sec. 226.9(b), (c), or (g). However, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does prohibit application of an increased rate, fee, or charge during the first year after the account is opened, while the account is closed, or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions. If Sec. 226.9(b), (c), or (g) permits a card issuer to apply an increased rate, fee, or charge on a particular date and the account is closed on that date or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions on that date, the card issuer may delay application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply that rate, fee, or charge (assuming the increase is otherwise consistent with Sec. 226.55). See examples in comment 55(b)-2.iii. However, if the account is closed or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions on the first day of the following billing cycle, then the card issuer must provide a new notice of the increased rate, fee, or charge consistent with Sec. 226.9(b), (c), or (g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in transactions. For purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. An account is considered open for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) on any date that the card issuer may consider the account open for purposes of Sec. 226.52(a)(1). See comment 52(a)(1)-4.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(4) Delinquency exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Receipt of required minimum periodic payment within 60 days of due date. Section 226.55(b)(4) applies when a card issuer has not received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment. In order to satisfy this condition, a card issuer that requires monthly minimum payments generally must not have received two consecutive required minimum periodic payments. Whether a required minimum periodic payment has been received for purposes of Sec. 226.55(b)(4) depends on whether the amount received is equal to or more than the first outstanding required minimum periodic payment. For example, assume that the required minimum periodic payments for a credit card account are due on the fifteenth day of the month. On May 13, the card issuer has not received the $50 required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 or the $150 required minimum periodic payment due on April 15. The sixtieth day after the March 15 payment due date is May 14. If the card issuer receives a $50 payment on May 14, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) does not apply because the payment is equal to the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 and therefore the account is not more than 60 days delinquent. However, if the card issuer instead received a $40 payment on May 14, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) would apply beginning on May 15 because the payment is less than the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15. Furthermore, if the card issuer received the $50 payment on May 15, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) would apply because the card issuer did not receive the required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 within 60 days after the due date for that payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(i)(B). A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.9(g)(3)(i)(B) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reduction in rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii). Section 226.55(b)(4)(ii) provides that, if the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the first payment due following the effective date of the increase, the card issuer must reduce any annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase with respect to transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice.</p><p class="depth0">i. Six consecutive payments immediately following effective date of increase. Section 226.55(b)(4)(ii) does not apply if the card issuer does not receive six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the payment due immediately following the effective date of the increase, even if, at some later point in time, the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge that applied before increase. Although Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate,

fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with any of the other exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the Sec. 226.55(b)(4) increase and the temporary rate expired before a reduction in rate pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii), the card issuer may apply an increased rate to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the Sec. 226.55(b)(4) increase, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Delayed implementation of reduction. If Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge on a date that is not the first day of a billing cycle, the card issuer may delay application of the reduced rate, fee, or charge until the first day of the following billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the required minimum periodic payments are due on the fifteenth day of the month. Assume also that the account has a $5,000 purchase balance to which a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies. On May 16 of year one, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic payments due on the fifteenth day of March, April, or May and sends a Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice stating that the annual percentage rate applicable to the $5,000 balance and to new transactions will increase to 28% effective July 1. On July 1, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% rate to the $5,000 balance and to new transactions. The card issuer receives the required minimum periodic payments due on the fifteenth day of July, August, September, October, November, and December. On January 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%. The card issuer is not required to reduce the rate that applies to any transactions that occurred on or after May 31 (which is the fifteenth day after provision of the Sec. 226.9(c) or (g) notice).</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 226.55(b)(4) increase was scheduled to increase to 20% on August 1 of year one (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 20%.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 226.55(b)(4) increase was scheduled to increase to 20% on March 1 of year two (pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%.</p><p class="depth0">D. Same facts as paragraph iv.A. above except that the 15% rate that applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 226.55(b)(4) increase was a variable rate that was determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control (consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2)). On January 1 of year two, Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.</p><p class="depth0">E. For an example of the application of Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(ii) to deferred interest or similar programs, see comment 55(b)(1)-3.ii.C.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(5) Workout and temporary hardship arrangement exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of exception. Nothing in Sec. 226.55(b)(5) permits a card issuer to alter the requirements of Sec. 226.55 pursuant to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement. For example, a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement unless otherwise permitted by Sec. 226.55. In addition, a card issuer cannot require the consumer to make payments with respect to a protected balance that exceed the payments permitted under Sec. 226.55(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D). A card issuer that has complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D) has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 226.55(b)(5)(i). See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-10. Thus, although the disclosures required by Sec. 226.55(b)(5)(i) must generally be provided in writing prior to commencement of the arrangement, a card issuer may comply with Sec. 226.55(b)(5)(i) by complying with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D), which states that the disclosure of the terms of the arrangement may be made orally by telephone, provided that the card issuer mails or delivers a written disclosure of the terms of the arrangement to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable after the oral disclosure is provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge that applied before workout or temporary hardship arrangement. Upon the completion or failure of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement, Sec. 226.55(b)(5)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from applying to any transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the arrangement an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to commencement of the arrangement. However, this provision does not prohibit the

card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge upon completion or failure of the arrangement, to the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the arrangement and that rate expired during the arrangement, the card issuer may apply an increased rate upon completion or failure of the arrangement to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the arrangement, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate upon completion or failure of the arrangement to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that an account is subject to a $50 annual fee and that, consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(4), the margin used to determine a variable annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance is increased from 5 percentage points to 15 percentage points. Assume also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to a workout arrangement that reduces the annual fee to $0 and reduces the margin back to 5 points on the condition that the consumer pay a specified amount by the payment due date each month. If the consumer does not pay the agreed-upon amount by the payment due date, Sec. 226.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the annual fee to $50 and increase the margin for the variable rate that applies to the $5,000 balance up to 15 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a consumer fails to make four consecutive monthly minimum payments totaling $480 on a consumer credit card account with a balance of $6,000 and that, consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(4), the annual percentage rate that applies to that balance is increased from a non-variable rate of 15% to a non-variable penalty rate of 30%. Assume also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to a temporary hardship arrangement that reduces all rates on the account to 0% on the condition that the consumer pay an amount by the payment due date each month that is sufficient to cure the $480 delinquency within six months. If the consumer pays the agreed-upon amount by the payment due date during the six-month period and cures the delinquency, Sec. 226.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $6,000 balance to 15% or any other rate up to the 30% penalty rate.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(6) Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate that does not exceed rate that applied before decrease. Once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, Sec. 226.55(b)(6) prohibits a card issuer from applying an annual percentage rate to any transactions that occurred prior to a decrease in rate pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 that exceeds the rate that applied to those transactions prior to the decrease. However, this provision does not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies, to the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the decrease and that rate expired during the period that 50 U.S.C. app. 527 applied to the account, the card issuer may apply an increased rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the decrease, the card issuer may apply any increase in that variable rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. Assume that on December 31 of year one the annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance on a credit card account is a variable rate that is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the card issuer's control. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer reduces the rate that applies to the $5,000 balance to a non-variable rate of 6% pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527. On January 1 of year three, 50 U.S.C. app. 527 ceases to apply and the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that on February 15 of year three the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin will apply to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance. On February 15 of year three, Sec. 226.55(b)(6) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance at the variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.</p><p class="depth0">55(c) Treatment of protected balances.</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(1) Definition of protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of protected balance. Assume that, on March 15 of year two, an account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 12% and that, on March 16, the card issuer sends a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) informing the consumer that the annual percentage rate for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 15% on May 1. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is March 29. On March 29, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On March 30, the consumer makes a $150 purchase. On May 1, Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at 15% on the $150 purchase made on March 30 but does not permit the card issuer to apply that 15% rate to the $1,100 purchase balance as of March 29. Accordingly, the protected balance for purposes of Sec. 226.55(c) is the $1,100 purchase balance as of March 29. The $150 purchase made on March 30 is not part of the protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. First year after account opening. Section 226.55(c) applies to amounts owed for a category of transactions to which an increased

annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge cannot be applied after the rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to Sec. 226.55(b)(3). Because Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) during the first year after account opening, Sec. 226.55(c) does not apply to balances during the first year after account opening.</p><p class="depth0">3. Increased fees and charges. Except as provided in Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii), Sec. 226.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with the applicable notice requirements in Sec. 226.9(b) or (c), provided that the increased fee or charge is not applied to a protected balance. To the extent consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii), a card issuer is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the account as a whole or to balances other than the protected balance. For example, after the first year following account opening, a card issuer generally may add or increase an annual or a monthly maintenance fee for an account after complying with the notice requirements in Sec. 226.9(c), including notifying the consumer of the right to reject the new or increased fee under Sec. 226.9(h). However, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 226.55(b), an increased fee or charge cannot be applied to an account while the account is closed or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions. See Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii); see also Sec. Sec. 226.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) and 226.55(d)(1). Furthermore, if the consumer rejects an increase in a fee or charge pursuant to Sec. 226.9(h), the card issuer is prohibited from applying the increased fee or charge to the account and from imposing any other fee or charge solely as a result of the rejection. See Sec. 226.9(h)(2)(i) and (ii); comment 9(h)(2)(ii)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing balance computation method. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from changing the balance computation method that applies to new transactions as well as protected balances.</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(2) Repayment of protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">1. No less beneficial to the consumer. A card issuer may provide a method of repaying the protected balance that is different from the methods listed in Sec. 226.55(c)(2) so long as the method used is no less beneficial to the consumer than one of the listed methods. A method is no less beneficial to the consumer if the method results in a required minimum periodic payment that is equal to or less than a minimum payment calculated using the method for the account before the effective date of the increase. Similarly, a method is no less beneficial to the consumer if the method amortizes the balance in five years or longer or if the method results in a required minimum periodic payment that is equal to or less than a minimum payment calculated consistent with Sec. 226.55(c)(2)(iii). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If at account opening the cardholder agreement stated that the required minimum periodic payment would be either the total of fees and interest charges plus 1% of the total amount owed or $20 (whichever is greater), the card issuer may require the consumer to make a minimum payment of $20 even if doing so would pay off the balance in less than five years or constitute more than 2% of the balance plus fees and interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer could increase the percentage of the balance included in the required minimum periodic payment from 2% to 5% so long as doing so would not result in amortization of the balance in less than five years.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A card issuer could require the consumer to make a required minimum periodic payment that amortizes the balance in four years so long as doing so would not more than double the percentage of the balance included in the minimum payment prior to the date on which the increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge became effective.</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(2)(ii) Five-year amortization period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amortization period starting from effective date of increase. Section 226.55(c)(2)(ii) provides for an amortization period for the protected balance of no less than five years, starting from the date on which the increased annual percentage rate or fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) became effective. A card issuer is not required to recalculate the required minimum periodic payment for the protected balance if, during the amortization period, that balance is reduced as a result of the allocation of payments by the consumer in excess of that minimum payment consistent with Sec. 226.53 or any other practice permitted by these rules and other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortization when applicable rate is variable. If the annual percentage rate that applies to the protected balance varies with an index, the card issuer may adjust the interest charges included in the required minimum periodic payment for that balance accordingly in order to ensure that the balance is amortized in five years. For example, assume that a variable rate that is currently 15% applies to a protected balance and that, in order to amortize that balance in five years, the required minimum periodic payment must include a specific amount of principal plus all accrued interest charges. If the 15% variable rate increases due to an increase in the index, the creditor may increase the required minimum periodic payment to include the additional interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(2)(iii) Doubling repayment rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Portion of required minimum periodic payment on other balances. Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) addresses the portion of the required minimum periodic payment based on the protected balance. Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit or otherwise address the card issuer's ability to determine the portion of the required minimum periodic payment based on other balances on the account or the card issuer's ability to apply that portion of the minimum payment to the balances on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. Assume that the method used by a card issuer to calculate the required minimum periodic payment for a credit card account requires the consumer to pay either the total of fees and accrued interest charges plus 2% of the total amount owed or $50, whichever is greater. Assume also that the account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and a cash advance balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and that the card issuer increases the rate for purchases to 18% but does not increase the rate for cash advances. Under Sec. 226.55(c)(2)(iii), the card issuer may require the consumer to pay fees and interest plus 4% of the $2,000 purchase balance. Section 226.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit the card issuer's ability to increase the portion of the required minimum periodic payment that is based on the cash advance balance.</p><p class="depth0">55(d) Continuing application.</p><p class="depth0">1. Closed accounts. If a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance is closed, Sec. 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a card issuer or a consumer closes a credit card account with a balance, Sec. 226.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual percentage rate that applies to that balance or imposing a periodic fee based solely on that balance that was not charged before the account was closed (such as a closed account fee) unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Acquired accounts. If, through merger or acquisition (for example), a card issuer acquires a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance, Sec. 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a credit card account has a $1,000 purchase balance with an annual percentage rate of 15% and the card issuer that acquires that account applies an 18% rate to purchases, Sec. 226.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from applying the 18% rate to the $1,000 balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">3. Balance transfers.</p><p class="depth0">i. Between accounts issued by the same creditor. If a balance is transferred from a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor to another credit account issued by the same creditor or its affiliate or subsidiary, Sec. 226.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a credit card account has a $2,000 purchase balance with an annual percentage rate of 15% and that balance is transferred to another credit card account issued by the same creditor that applies an 18% rate to purchases, Sec. 226.55(d)(2) prohibits the creditor from applying the 18% rate to the $2,000 balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). However, the creditor would not generally be prohibited from charging a new periodic fee (such as an annual fee) on the second account so long as the fee is not based solely on the $2,000 balance and the creditor has notified the consumer of the fee either by providing written notice 45 days before imposing the fee pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) or by providing account-opening disclosures pursuant to Sec. 226.6(b). See also Sec. 226.55(b)(3)(iii); comment 55(b)(3)-3; comment 5(b)(1)(i)-6. Additional circumstances in which a balance is considered transferred for purposes of Sec. 226.55(d)(2) include when:</p><p class="depth0">A. A retail credit card account with a balance is replaced or substituted with a cobranded general purpose credit card account that can be used with a broader merchant base;</p><p class="depth0">B. A credit card account with a balance is replaced or substituted with another credit card account offering different features;</p><p class="depth0">C. A credit card account with a balance is consolidated or combined with one or more other credit card accounts into a single credit card account; and</p><p class="depth0">D. A credit card account is replaced or substituted with a line of credit that can be accessed solely by an account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Between accounts issued by different creditors. If a balance is transferred to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor from a credit card account issued by a different creditor or an institution that is not an affiliate or subsidiary of the creditor that issued the account to which the balance is transferred, Sec. 226.55(d)(2) does not prohibit the creditor to which the balance is transferred from applying its account terms to that balance, provided that those terms comply with this part. For example, if a credit card account issued by creditor A has a $1,000 purchase balance at an annual percentage rate of 15% and the consumer transfers that balance to a credit card account with a purchase rate of 17% issued by creditor B, creditor B may apply the 17% rate to the $1,000 balance. However, creditor B may not subsequently increase the rate on that balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">55(e) Promotional waivers or rebates of interest, fees, and other charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. Nothing in Sec. 226.55 prohibits a card issuer from waiving or rebating finance charges due to a periodic interest rate or a

fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, if a card issuer promotes and applies the waiver or rebate to an account, the card issuer cannot temporarily or permanently cease or terminate any portion of the waiver or rebate on that account unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 226.55(b). For example</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer applies an annual percentage rate of 15% to balance transfers but promotes a program under which all of the interest accrued on transferred balances will be waived or rebated for one year. If, prior to the commencement of the one-year period, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the annual percentage rate that will apply to transferred balances after expiration of that period consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i), Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances after one year. Furthermore, if, during the one-year period, a required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the payment due date, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances (after providing a notice consistent with Sec. 226.9(g) and Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of the account, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances until the expiration of the one-year period.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer imposes a monthly maintenance fee of $10 but promotes a program under which the fee will be waived or rebated for the six months following account opening. If, prior to account opening, the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the monthly maintenance fee that will be imposed after expiration of that period consistent with Sec. 226.55(b)(1)(i), Sec. 226.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee six months after account opening. Furthermore, if, during the six-month period, a required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the payment due date, Sec. 226.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee (after providing a notice consistent with Sec. 226.9(c) and Sec. 226.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of the account, Sec. 226.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee until the expiration of the six-month period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Promotion of waiver or rebate. For purposes of Sec. 226.55(e), a card issuer generally promotes a waiver or rebate if the card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in an advertisement (as defined in Sec. 226.2(a)(2)). See comment 2(a)(2)-1. In addition, a card issuer generally promotes a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e) if the card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in communications regarding existing accounts (such as communications regarding a promotion that encourages additional or different uses of an existing account). However, a card issuer does not promote a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e) if the advertisement or communication relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge or to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples of promotional communications. The following are examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e)</p><p class="depth0">A. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in a newspaper, magazine, leaflet, promotional flyer, catalog, sign, or point-of-sale display, unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived.</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate on radio or television or through electronic advertisements (such as on the Internet), unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer discloses a waiver or rebate to individual consumers, such as by telephone, letter, or electronic communication, through direct mail literature, or on or with account statements, unless the disclosure relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge or to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of non-promotional communications. The following are examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is not promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e)</p><p class="depth0">A. After a card issuer has waived or rebated interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 226.55 with respect to an account, the issuer discloses the waiver or rebate to the accountholder on the periodic statement or by telephone, letter, or electronic communication. However, if the card issuer also discloses prospective waivers or rebates in the same communication, the issuer is promoting a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 226.55(e).</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer communicates with a consumer about a waiver or rebate of interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 226.55 in relation to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge, including a dispute under Sec. Sec. 226.12 or 226.13.</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer waives or rebates interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 226.55 in order to comply with a legal requirement (such as the limitations in Sec. 226.52(a)).</p><p class="depth0">D. A card issuer discloses a grace period, as defined in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(3).</p><p class="depth0">E. A card issuer provides a period after the payment due date during which interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 226.55 are waived or rebated even if a payment has not been received.</p><p class="depth0">F. A card issuer provides benefits (such as rewards points or cash back on purchases or finance charges) that can be applied to the account as credits, provided that the benefits are not promoted as reducing interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 226.55.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship of Sec. 226.55(e) to grace period. Section 226.55(e) does not apply to the waiver of finance charges due to a periodic rate consistent with a grace period, as defined in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.56--Requirements for Over-the-Limit Transactions</p><p class="depth0">56(b) Opt-in requirement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Policy and practice of declining over-the-limit transactions. Section 226.56(b)(1)(i)-(v), including the requirements to provide notice and obtain consumer consent, do not apply to any card issuer that has a policy and practice of declining to pay any over-the-limit transactions for the consumer's credit card account when the card issuer has a reasonable belief that completing a transaction will cause the consumer to exceed the consumer's credit limit for that account. For example, if a card issuer only authorizes those transactions which, at the time of authorization, would not cause the consumer to exceed a credit limit, it is not subject to the requirement to provide consumers notice and an opportunity to affirmatively consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. However, if an over-the-limit transaction is paid without the consumer providing affirmative consent, the card issuer may not charge a fee for paying the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Over-the-limit transactions not required to be authorized or paid. Section 226.56 does not require a card issuer to authorize or pay an over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent. A card issuer provides a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to provide affirmative consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions when, among other things, it provides reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A card issuer provides such reasonable methods if--</p><p class="depth0">i. On the application. The card issuer provides the notice on the application form that the consumer can fill out to request the service as part of the application;</p><p class="depth0">ii. By mail. The card issuer provides a form with the account-opening disclosures or the periodic statement for the consumer to fill out and mail to affirmatively request the service;</p><p class="depth0">iii. By telephone. The card issuer provides a readily available telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.</p><p class="depth0">iv. By electronic means. The card issuer provides an electronic means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, a card issuer could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its Web site, where the consumer can check a box to opt in and confirm that choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Separate consent required. A consumer's affirmative consent, or opt-in, to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions must be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgments obtained by the card issuer. For example, a consumer's signature on a credit application to request a credit card would not by itself sufficiently evidence the consumer's consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. However, a card issuer may obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a blank signature line or a check box on the application that the consumer can sign or select to request the over-the-limit service, provided that the signature line or check box is used solely for purposes of evidencing the choice and not for any other purpose, such as to also obtain consumer consents for other account services or features or to receive disclosures electronically.</p><p class="depth0">5. Written confirmation. A card issuer may comply with the requirement in Sec. 226.56(b)(1)(iv) to provide written confirmation of the consumer's decision to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions by providing the consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in form or by sending a letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has elected to opt into the card issuer's service. A card issuer may also satisfy the written confirmation requirement by providing the confirmation on the first periodic statement sent after the consumer has opted in. For example, a card issuer could provide a written notice consistent with Sec. 226.56(e)(2) on the periodic statement. A card issuer may not, however, assess any over-the-limit fees or charges on the consumer's credit card account unless and until the card issuer has sent the written confirmation. Thus, if a card issuer elects to provide written confirmation on the first periodic statement after the consumer has opted in, it would not be permitted to assess any over-the-limit fees or charges until the next statement cycle.</p><p class="depth0">56(b)(2) Completion of over-the-limit transactions without consumer consent.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of over-the-limit transactions paid without consumer consent. Section 226.56(b)(2)

provides that a card issuer may pay an over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has not provided affirmative consent, so long as the card issuer does not impose a fee or charge for paying the transaction. The prohibition on imposing fees for paying an over-the-limit transaction applies even in circumstances where the card issuer is unable to avoid paying a transaction that exceeds the consumer's credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">i. Transactions not submitted for authorization. A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer purchases a $3 cup of coffee using his credit card. Because of the small dollar amount of the transaction, the merchant does not submit the transaction to the card issuer for authorization. The transaction causes the consumer to exceed the credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Settlement amount exceeds authorization amount. A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer uses his credit card at a pay-at-the-pump fuel dispenser to purchase $50 of fuel. Before permitting the consumer to use the fuel pump, the merchant verifies the validity of the card by requesting an authorization hold of $1. The subsequent $50 transaction amount causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Intervening charges. A consumer has not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer makes a $50 purchase using his credit card. However, before the $50 transaction is charged to the consumer's account, a separate recurring charge is posted to the account. The $50 purchase then causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">2. Permissible fees or charges when a consumer has not consented. Section 226.56(b)(2) does not preclude a card issuer from assessing fees or charges other than over-the-limit fees when an over-the-limit transaction is completed. For example, if a consumer has not opted in, the card issuer may assess a balance transfer fee in connection with a balance transfer, provided such a fee is assessed whether or not the transfer exceeds the credit limit. Section 226.56(b)(2) does not limit the card issuer's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount of the over-the-limit transaction if the card issuer is permitted to do so under applicable law. The card issuer may also assess interest charges in connection with the over-the-limit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">56(c) Method of election.</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer-determined methods. A card issuer may determine the means available to consumers to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. For example, a card issuer may decide to obtain consents in writing, electronically, or orally, or through some combination of these methods. Section 226.56(c) further requires, however, that such methods must be made equally available for consumers to revoke a prior consent. Thus, for example, if a card issuer allows a consumer to consent in writing or electronically, it must also allow the consumer to revoke that consent in writing or electronically.</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic requests. A consumer consent or revocation request submitted electronically is not considered a consumer disclosure for purposes of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">56(d) Timing and placement of notices.</p><p class="depth0">1. Contemporaneous notice for oral or electronic consent. Under Sec. 226.56(d)(1)(ii), if a card issuer seeks to obtain consent from the consumer orally or by electronic means, the card issuer must provide a notice containing the disclosures in Sec. 226.56(e)(1) prior to and as part of the process of obtaining the consumer's consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(e) Content.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of over-the-limit fee. See Model Forms G-25(A) and G-25(B) for guidance on how to disclose the amount of the over-the-limit fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice content. In describing the consumer's right to affirmatively consent to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the card issuer may explain that any transactions that exceed the consumer's credit limit will be declined if the consumer does not consent to the service. In addition, the card issuer should explain that even if a consumer consents, the payment of over-the-limit transactions is at the discretion of the card issuer. For example, the card issuer may indicate that it may decline a transaction for any reason, such as if the consumer is past due or significantly over the limit. The card issuer may also disclose the consumer's right to revoke consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(f) Joint relationships.</p><p class="depth0">1. Authorized users. Section 226.56(f) does not permit a card issuer to treat a request to opt in to or to revoke a prior request for the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions from an authorized user that is not jointly liable on a credit card account as

a consent or revocation request for that account.</p><p class="depth0">56(g) Continuing right to opt in or revoke opt-in.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or charges for over-the-limit transactions incurred prior to revocation. Section 226.56(g) provides that a consumer may revoke his or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision does not require the card issuer to waive or reverse any over-the-limit fees or charges assessed to the consumer's account for transactions that occurred prior to the card issuer's implementation of the consumer's revocation request. Nor does this requirement prevent the card issuer from assessing over-the-limit fees in subsequent cycles if the consumer's account balance continues to exceed the credit limit after the payment due date as a result of an over-the-limit transaction that occurred prior to the consumer's revocation of consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(h) Duration of opt-in.</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer ability to stop paying over-the-limit transactions after consumer consent. A card issuer may cease paying over-the-limit transactions for consumers that have previously opted in at any time and for any reason. For example, a card issuer may stop paying over-the-limit transactions for a consumer to respond to changes in the credit risk presented by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">56(j) Prohibited practices.</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic fees or charges. A card issuer may charge an over-the-limit fee or charge only if the consumer has exceeded the credit limit during the billing cycle. Thus, a card issuer may not impose any recurring or periodic fees for paying over-the-limit transactions (for example, a monthly ``over-the-limit protection'' service fee), even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to or opted in to the service, unless the consumer has in fact exceeded the credit limit during that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of limits on fees or charges imposed per billing cycle. Section 226.56(j)(1) generally prohibits a card issuer from assessing a fee or charge due to the same over-the-limit transaction for more than three billing cycles. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer has opted into a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer exceeds the credit limit during the December billing cycle and does not make sufficient payment to bring the account balance back under the limit for four consecutive cycles. The consumer does not engage in any additional transactions during this period. In this case, Sec. 226.56(j)(1) would permit the card issuer to charge a maximum of three over-the-limit fees for the December over-the-limit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume the same facts as above except that the consumer makes sufficient payment to reduce his account balance by the payment due date during the February billing cycle. The card issuer may charge over-the-limit fees for the December and January billing cycles. However, because the consumer's account balance was below the credit limit by the payment due date for the February billing cycle, the card issuer may not charge an over-the-limit fee for the February billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume the same facts as in paragraph i., except that the consumer engages in another over-the-limit transaction during the February billing cycle. Because the consumer has obtained an additional extension of credit which causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit, the card issuer may charge over-the-limit fees for the December transaction on the January, February and March billing statements, and additional over-the-limit fees for the February transaction on the April and May billing statements. The card issuer may not charge an over-the-limit fee for each of the December and the February transactions on the March billing statement because it is prohibited from imposing more than one over-the-limit fee during a billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">3. Replenishment of credit line. Section 226.56(j)(2) does not prevent a card issuer from delaying replenishment of a consumer's available credit where appropriate, for example, where the card issuer may suspect fraud on the credit card account. However, a card issuer may not assess an over-the-limit fee or charge if the over-the-limit transaction is caused by the card issuer's decision not to promptly replenish the available credit after the consumer's payment is credited to the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples of conditioning. Section 226.56(j)(3) prohibits a card issuer from conditioning or otherwise tying the amount of a consumer's credit limit on the consumer affirmatively consenting to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions where the card issuer assesses an over-the-limit fee for the transaction. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Amount of credit limit. Assume that a card issuer offers a credit card with a credit limit of $1,000. The consumer is informed that if the consumer opts in to the payment of the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the initial credit limit would be increased to $1,300. If the card issuer would have offered the credit card with the $1,300 credit limit but for the fact that the consumer did not consent to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the card issuer would not be in compliance with Sec. 226.56(j)(3). Section 226.56(j)(3) prohibits the card issuer from tying the consumer's opt-in to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions as a condition of obtaining the credit card with the $1,300 credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Access to credit. Assume the same facts as above, except that the card issuer declines the consumer's application altogether because the consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The card issuer is not in compliance with Sec. 226.56(j)(3) because the card issuer has required the consumer's consent as a condition of obtaining credit.</p><p class="depth0">5. Over-the-limit fees caused by accrued fees or interest. Section 226.56(j)(4) prohibits a card issuer from imposing any over-the-limit fees or charges on a consumer's account if the consumer has exceeded the credit limit solely because charges imposed as part of the plan as described in Sec. 226.6(b)(3) were charged to the consumer's account during the billing cycle. For example, a card issuer may not assess an over-the-limit fee or charge even if the credit limit was exceeded due to fees for services requested by the consumer if such fees would constitute charges imposed as part of the plan (such as fees for voluntary debt cancellation or suspension coverage). Section 226.56(j)(4) does not, however, restrict card issuers from assessing over-the-limit fees or charges due to accrued finance charges or fees from prior cycles that have subsequently been added to the account balance. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer has opted in to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer's account has a credit limit of $500. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. The account is not eligible for a grace period as defined in Sec. 226.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(3). On December 31, the only balance on the account is a purchase balance of $475. On that same date, $50 in fees charged as part of the plan under Sec. 226.6(b)(3)(i) and interest charges are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to $525. Although the total balance exceeds the $500 credit limit, Sec. 226.56(j)(4) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee or charge for the December billing cycle in these circumstances because the consumer's credit limit was exceeded solely because of the imposition of fees and interest charges during that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on December 31, the only balance on the account is a purchase balance of $400. On that same date, $50 in fees imposed as part of the plan under Sec. 226.6(b)(3)(i), including interest charges, are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to $450. The consumer makes a $25 payment by the January payment due date and the remaining $25 in fees imposed as part of the plan in December is added to the outstanding balance. On January 25, an $80 purchase is charged to the account. At the close of the cycle on January 31, an additional $20 in fees imposed as part of the plan are imposed on the account, increasing the total balance to $525. Because Sec. 226.56(j)(4) does not require the issuer to consider fees imposed as part of the plan for the prior cycle in determining whether an over-the-limit fee may be properly assessed for the current cycle, the issuer need not take into account the remaining $25 in fees and interest charges from the December cycle in determining whether fees imposed as part of the plan caused the consumer to exceed the credit limit during the January cycle. Thus, under these circumstances, Sec. 226.56(j)(4) does not prohibit the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit fee or charge for the January billing cycle because the $20 in fees imposed as part of the plan for the January billing cycle did not cause the consumer to exceed the credit limit during that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">6. Additional restrictions on over-the-limit fees. See Sec. 226.52(b).</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.57--Reporting and Marketing Rules for College Student Open-</p><p class="depth0">End Credit</p><p class="depth0">57(a) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">57(a)(1) College student credit card.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The definition of college student credit card excludes home-equity lines of credit accessed by credit cards and overdraft lines of credit accessed by debit cards. A college student credit card includes a college affinity card within the meaning of TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A). In addition, a card may fall within the scope of the definition regardless of the fact that it is not intentionally targeted at or marketed to college students. For example, an agreement between a college and a card issuer may provide for marketing of credit cards to alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers who have a relationship with the college, but also contain provisions that contemplate the issuance of cards to students. A credit card issued to a student at the college in connection with such an agreement qualifies as a college student credit card.</p><p class="depth0">57(a)(5) College credit card agreement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Section 226.57(a)(5) defines ``college credit card agreement'' to include any business, marketing or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement provides for the issuance of credit cards to full-time or part-time students. Business, marketing or promotional agreements may include a broad range of arrangements between a card issuer and an institution of higher education or affiliated organization, including arrangements that do not meet the criteria to be considered college affinity card agreements as discussed in TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A). For example, TILA Section 127(r)(1)(A) specifies that

under a college affinity card agreement, the card issuer has agreed to make a donation to the institution or affiliated organization, the card issuer has agreed to offer discounted terms to the consumer, or the credit card will display pictures, symbols, or words identified with the institution or affiliated organization; even if these conditions are not met, an agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement, if the agreement is a business, marketing or promotional agreement that contemplates the issuance of college student credit cards to college students currently enrolled (either full-time or part-time) at the institution. An agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement even if marketing of cards under the agreement is targeted at alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers, as long as cards may also be issued to students in connection with the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">57(b) Public disclosure of agreements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Public disclosure. Section 226.57(b) requires an institution of higher education to publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a credit card. Examples of publicly disclosing such contracts or agreements include, but are not limited to, posting such contracts or agreements on the institution's Web site or making such contracts or agreements available upon request, provided the procedures for requesting the documents are reasonable and free of cost to the requestor, and the requested contracts or agreements are provided within a reasonable time frame.</p><p class="depth0">2. Redaction prohibited. An institution of higher education must publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer for the purpose of marketing a credit card in its entirety and may not redact any portion of such contract or agreement. Any clause existing in such contracts or agreements, providing for the confidentiality of any portion of the contract or agreement, would be invalid to the extent it restricts the ability of the institution of higher education to publicly disclose the contract or agreement in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0">57(c) Prohibited inducements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Tangible item clarified. A tangible item includes any physical item, such as a gift card, a t-shirt, or a magazine subscription, that a card issuer or creditor offers to induce a college student to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor. Tangible items do not include non-physical inducements such as discounts, rewards points, or promotional credit terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Inducement clarified. If a tangible item is offered to a person whether or not that person applies for or opens an open-end consumer credit plan, the tangible item has not been offered to induce the person to apply for or open the plan. For example, refreshments offered to a college student on campus that are not conditioned on whether the student has applied for or agreed to open an open-end consumer credit plan would not violate Sec. 226.57(c).</p><p class="depth0">3. Near campus clarified. A location that is within 1,000 feet of the border of the campus of an institution of higher education, as defined by the institution of higher education, is considered near the campus of an institution of higher education.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mailings included. The prohibition in Sec. 226.57(c) on offering a tangible item to a college student to induce such student to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor applies to any solicitation or application mailed to a college student at an address on or near the campus of an institution of higher education.</p><p class="depth0">5. Related event clarified. An event is related to an institution of higher education if the marketing of such event uses the name, emblem, mascot, or logo of an institution of higher education, or other words, pictures, symbols identified with an institution of higher education in a way that implies that the institution of higher education endorses or otherwise sponsors the event.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonable procedures for determining if applicant is a student. Section 226.57(c) applies solely to offering a tangible item to a college student. Therefore, a card issuer or creditor may offer any person who is not a college student a tangible item to induce such person to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor, on campus, near campus, or at an event sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education. The card issuer or creditor must have reasonable procedures for determining whether an applicant is a college student before giving the applicant the tangible item. For example, a card issuer or creditor may ask whether the applicant is a college student as part of the application process. The card issuer or creditor may rely on the representations made by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">57(d) Annual report to the Board.</p><p class="depth0">57(d)(2) Contents of report.</p><p class="depth0">1. Memorandum of understanding. Section 226.57(d)(2) requires that the report to the Board include, among other items, a copy of any memorandum of understanding between the card issuer and the institution (or affiliated organization) that ``directly or indirectly relates to the college credit card agreement or that controls or directs any obligations or distribution of benefits between any such entities.'' Such a memorandum of understanding includes any document that amends the college credit card agreement, or that constitutes a further agreement between the parties as to the interpretation or

administration of the agreement. For example, a memorandum of understanding required to be included in the report would include a document that provides details on the dollar amounts of payments from the card issuer to the university, to supplement the original agreement which only provided for payments in general terms (e.g., as a percentage). A memorandum of understanding for these purposes would not include email (or other) messages that merely discuss matters such as the addresses to which payments should be sent or the names of contact persons for carrying out the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.58--Internet Posting of Credit Card Agreements</p><p class="depth0">58(b) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(1) Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Inclusion of pricing information. For purposes of this section, a credit card agreement is deemed to include certain information, such as annual percentage rates and fees, even if the issuer does not otherwise include this information in the basic credit contract. This information is listed under the defined term ``pricing information'' in Sec. 226.58(b)(7). For example, the basic credit contract may not specify rates, fees and other information that constitutes pricing information as defined in Sec. 226.58(b)(7); instead, such information may be provided to the cardholder in a separate document sent along with the card. However, this information nevertheless constitutes part of the agreement for purposes of Sec. 226.58.</p><p class="depth0">2. Provisions contained in separate documents included. A credit card agreement is defined as the written document or documents evidencing the terms of the legal obligation, or the prospective legal obligation, between a card issuer and a consumer for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. An agreement therefore may consist of several documents that, taken together, define the legal obligation between the issuer and consumer. For example, provisions that mandate arbitration or allow an issuer to unilaterally alter the terms of the card issuer's or consumer's obligation are part of the agreement even if they are provided to the consumer in a document separate from the basic credit contract.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(2) Amends.</p><p class="depth0">1. Substantive changes. A change to an agreement is substantive, and therefore is deemed an amendment of the agreement, if it alters the rights or obligations of the parties. Section 226.58(b)(2) provides that any change in the pricing information, as defined in Sec. 226.58(b)(7), is deemed to be substantive. Examples of other changes that generally would be considered substantive include: (i) Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to unilaterally change the terms of an agreement; (ii) addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer an obligation under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an additional fee; (iii) changes that may affect the cost of credit to the consumer, such as changes in a provision describing how the minimum payment will be calculated; (iv) changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are construed or applied, such as changes in a choice-of-law provision; and (v) changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may apply, such as provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-substantive changes. Changes that generally would not be considered substantive include, for example: (i) Correction of typographical errors that do not affect the meaning of any terms of the agreement; (ii) changes to the card issuer's corporate name, logo, or tagline; (iii) changes to the format of the agreement, such as conversion to a booklet from a full-sheet format, changes in font, or changes in margins; (iv) changes to the name of the credit card to which the program applies; (v) reordering sections of the agreement without affecting the meaning of any terms of the agreement; (vi) adding, removing, or modifying a table of contents or index; and (vii) changes to titles, headings, section numbers, or captions.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(4) Card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer clarified. Section 226.58(b)(4) provides that, for purposes of Sec. 226.58, card issuer or issuer means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a credit card agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank Y work together to issue credit cards. A consumer that obtains a credit card issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is subject to an agreement that states ``This is an agreement between you, the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Credit Card.'' The card issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the card through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of third-party service providers. An institution that is the card issuer as defined in Sec. 226.58(b)(4) has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.58. However, a card issuer generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under Sec. 226.58, provided that the issuer acts in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the institution with which it partners to

issue credit cards to fulfill the requirements of Sec. 226.58 on the issuer's behalf. For example, Retailer and Bank work together to issue credit cards. Under the Sec. 226.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the issuer of these credit cards for purposes of Sec. 226.58. However, Retailer services the credit card accounts, including mailing account opening materials and periodic statements to cardholders. While Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with Sec. 226.58, Bank may arrange for Retailer (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to submit credit card agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58 on Bank's behalf. Bank must comply with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Partner institution Web sites. As explained in comments 58(d)-2 and 58(e)-3, if an issuer provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of Sec. 226.58. Such a Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.58 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site is an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.58. For example, Retailer and Bank work together to issue credit cards. Under the Sec. 226.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the issuer of these credit cards for purposes of Sec. 226.58. Bank does not have a Web site. However, cardholders can access information about their individual accounts, such as balance information and copies of statements, through a Web site maintained by Retailer. Retailer designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site. The Web site is branded and held out to the public as belonging to Retailer. Because cardholders can access information about their individual accounts through this Web site, the Web site is deemed to be maintained by Bank for purposes of Sec. 226.58. Bank therefore may comply with Sec. 226.58(d) by ensuring that agreements offered to the public are posted on Retailer's Web site in accordance with Sec. 226.58(d). Bank may comply with Sec. 226.58(e) by ensuring that cardholders can request copies of their individual agreements through Retailer's Web site in accordance with Sec. 226.58(e)(1). Bank need not create and maintain a Web site branded and held out to the public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with Sec. Sec. 226.58(d) and (e) as long as Bank ensures that Retailer's Web site complies with these sections.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, Sec. 226.58(d)(1) provides that, with respect to an agreement offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, an issuer may comply with Sec. 226.58(d) by posting the agreement on the publicly available Web site of at least one of the merchants at which credit cards issued under each private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. This rule is not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific information through the merchant's Web site.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(5) Offers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Cards offered to limited groups. A card issuer is deemed to offer a credit card agreement to the public even if the issuer solicits, or accepts applications from, only a limited group of persons. For example, a card issuer may market affinity cards to students and alumni of a particular educational institution, or may solicit only high-net-worth individuals for a particular card; in these cases, the agreement would be considered to be offered to the public. Similarly, agreements for credit cards issued by a credit union are considered to be offered to the public even though such cards are available only to credit union members.</p><p class="depth0">2. Individualized agreements. A card issuer is deemed to offer a credit card agreement to the public even if the terms of the agreement are changed immediately upon opening of an account to terms not offered to the public.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(6) Open account.</p><p class="depth0">1. Open account clarified. The definition of open account includes a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan if either: (i) The cardholder can obtain extensions of credit on the account; or (ii) there is an outstanding balance on the account that has not been charged off. Under this definition, an account that meets either of these criteria is considered to be open even if the account is inactive. Similarly, if an account has been closed for new activity (for example, due to default by the cardholder), but the cardholder is still making payments to pay off the outstanding balance, the account is considered open.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(8) Private label credit card account and private label credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Private label credit card account. The term private label credit card account means a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a credit card that can be used to make purchases only at a single merchant or an affiliated group of merchants. This term applies to any such credit card account, regardless of whether it is issued by the merchant or its affiliate or by an unaffiliated third party.</p><p class="depth0">2. Co-branded credit cards. The term private label credit card account does not include

accounts with so-called co-branded credit cards. Credit cards that display the name, mark, or logo of a merchant or affiliated group of merchants as well as the mark, logo, or brand of payment network are generally referred to as co-branded cards. While these credit cards may display the brand of the merchant or affiliated group of merchants as the dominant brand on the card, such credit cards are usable at any merchant that participates in the payment network. Because these credit cards can be used at multiple unaffiliated merchants, accounts with such credit cards are not considered private label credit card accounts under Sec. 226.58(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">3. Affiliated group of merchants. The term ``affiliated group of merchants'' means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control. For example, the term would include franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among each other, by contract or otherwise, to accept a credit card bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, several local clothing retailers jointly agree to issue credit cards called the ``Main Street Fashion Card'' that can be used to make purchases only at those retailers. For purposes of this section, these retailers would be considered an affiliated group of merchants.</p><p class="depth0">4. Private label credit card plan. Which credit card accounts issued by a particular issuer constitute a private label credit card plan is determined by where the credit cards can be used. All of the private label credit card accounts issued by a particular card issuer with credit cards usable at the same merchant or affiliated group of merchants constitute a single private label credit card plan, regardless of whether the rates, fees, or other terms applicable to the individual credit card accounts differ. For example, a card issuer has 3,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 5,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and its affiliates. The card issuer has two separate private label credit card plans, as defined by Sec. 226.58(b)(8)--one plan consisting of 3,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and another plan consisting of 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and its affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">The example above remains the same regardless of whether (or the extent to which) the terms applicable to the individual open accounts differ. For example, assume that, with respect to the card issuer's 3,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A in the example above, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 12 percent, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 15 percent, and 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 18 percent. All of the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates have the same 15 percent purchase APR. The card issuer still has only two separate private label credit card plans, as defined by Sec. 226.58(b)(8). The open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A do not constitute three separate private label credit card plans under Sec. 226.58(b)(8), even though the accounts are subject to different terms.</p><p class="depth0">58(c) Submission of agreements to Board.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(1) Quarterly submissions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Quarterly submission requirement. Section 226.58(c)(1) requires card issuers to send quarterly submissions to the Board no later than the first business day on or after January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year. For example, a card issuer has already submitted three credit card agreements to the Board. On October 15, the card issuer stops offering agreement A. On November 20, the card issuer amends agreement B. On December 1, the issuer starts offering a new agreement D. The card issuer must submit to the Board no later than the first business day on or after January 31: (i) Notification that the card issuer is withdrawing agreement A, because it is no longer offered to the public; (ii) the amended version of agreement B; and (iii) agreement D.</p><p class="depth0">2. No quarterly submission required. Under Sec. 226.58(c)(1), a card issuer is not required to make any submission to the Board at a particular quarterly submission deadline if, during the previous calendar quarter, the card issuer did not take any of the following actions: (i) Offering a new credit card agreement that was not submitted to the Board previously; (ii) amending an agreement previously submitted to the Board; and (iii) ceasing to offer an agreement previously submitted to the Board. For example, a card issuer offers five agreements to the public as of September 30 and submits these to the Board by October 31, as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(1). Between September 30 and December 31, the card issuer continues to offer all five of these agreements to the public without amending them and does not begin offering any new agreements. The card issuer is not required to make any submission to the Board by the following January 31.</p><p class="depth0">3. Quarterly submission of complete set of updated agreements. Section 226.58(c)(1) permits a card issuer to submit to the Board on a quarterly basis a complete, updated set of the credit card agreements the card issuer offers to the public. For example, a card issuer offers agreements A, B, and C to the

public as of March 31. The card issuer submits each of these agreements to the Board by April 30 as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(1). On May 15, the card issuer amends agreement A, but does not make any changes to agreements B or C. As of June 30, the card issuer continues to offer amended agreement A and agreements B and C to the public. At the next quarterly submission deadline, July 31, the card issuer must submit the entire amended agreement A and is not required to make any submission with respect to agreements B and C. The card issuer may either: (i) Submit the entire amended agreement A and make no submission with respect to agreements B and C; or (ii) submit the entire amended agreement A and also resubmit agreements B and C. A card issuer may choose to resubmit to the Board all of the agreements it offered to the public as of a particular quarterly submission deadline even if the card issuer has not introduced any new agreements or amended any agreements since its last submission and continues to offer all previously submitted agreements.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(3) Amended agreements.</p><p class="depth0">1. No requirement to resubmit agreements not amended. Under Sec. 226.58(c)(3), if a credit card agreement has been submitted to the Board, the agreement has not been amended, and the card issuer continues to offer the agreement to the public, no additional submission regarding that agreement is required. For example, a credit card issuer begins offering an agreement in October and submits the agreement to the Board the following January 31, as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer has not amended the agreement and is still offering the agreement to the public. The card issuer is not required to submit anything to the Board regarding that agreement by April 30.</p><p class="depth0">2. Submission of amended agreements. If a card issuer amends a credit card agreement previously submitted to the Board, Sec. 226.58(c)(3) requires the card issuer to submit the entire amended agreement to the Board. The issuer must submit the amended agreement to the Board by the first quarterly submission deadline after the last day of the calendar quarter in which the change became effective. However, the issuer is required to submit the amended agreement to the Board only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the change became effective. For example, a card issuer submits an agreement to the Board on October 31. On November 15, the issuer changes the balance computation method used under the agreement. Because an element of the pricing information has changed, the agreement has been amended for purposes of Sec. 226.58(c)(3). On December 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the change in the balance computation method became effective, the issuer still offers the agreement to the public as amended on November 15. The issuer must submit the entire amended agreement to the Board no later than January 31.</p><p class="depth0">3. Agreements amended but no longer offered to the public. A card issuer should submit an amended agreement to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(3) only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the amendment became effective. Agreements that are not offered to the public as of the last day of the calendar quarter should not be submitted to the Board. For example, on December 31 a card issuer offers two agreements, Agreement A and Agreement B. The issuer submits these agreements to the Board by January 31 as required by Sec. 226.58. On February 15, the issuer amends both Agreement A and Agreement B. On February 28, the issuer stops offering Agreement A to the public. On March 15, the issuer amends Agreement B a second time. As a result, on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter, the issuer offers to the public one agreement--Agreement B as amended on March 15. By the April 30 quarterly submission deadline, the issuer must: (1) Notify the Board that it is withdrawing Agreement A because Agreement A is no longer offered to the public; and (2) submit to the Board Agreement B as amended on March 15. The issuer should not submit to the Board either Agreement A as amended on February 15 or the earlier version of Agreement B (as amended on February 15), as neither was offered to the public on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">4. Change-in-terms notices not permissible. Section 226.58(c)(3) requires that if an agreement previously submitted to the Board is amended, the card issuer must submit the entire revised agreement to the Board. A card issuer may not fulfill this requirement by submitting a change-in-terms or similar notice covering only the terms that have changed. In addition, amendments must be integrated into the text of the agreement (or the addenda described in Sec. 226.58(c)(8)), not provided as separate riders. For example, a card issuer changes the purchase APR associated with an agreement the issuer has previously submitted to the Board. The purchase APR for that agreement was included in the addendum of pricing information, as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(8). The card issuer may not submit a change-in-terms or similar notice reflecting the change in APR, either alone or accompanied by the original text of the agreement and original pricing information addendum. Instead, the card issuer must revise the pricing information addendum to reflect the change in APR and submit to the Board the entire text of the agreement and the entire revised addendum, even though no

changes have been made to the provisions of the agreement and only one item on the pricing information addendum has changed.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(4) Withdrawal of agreements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of withdrawal of agreement. Section 226.58(c)(4) requires a card issuer to notify the Board if any agreement previously submitted to the Board by that issuer is no longer offered to the public by the first quarterly submission deadline after the last day of the calendar quarter in which the card issuer ceased to offer the agreement. For example, on January 5 a card issuer stops offering to the public an agreement it previously submitted to the Board. The card issuer must notify the Board that the agreement is being withdrawn by April 30, the first quarterly submission deadline after March 31, the last day of the calendar quarter in which the card issuer stopped offering the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(5) De minimis exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to other exceptions. The de minimis exception is distinct from the private label credit card exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6) and the product testing exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(7). The de minimis exception provides that a card issuer with fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts is not required to submit any agreements to the Board, regardless of whether those agreements qualify for the private label credit card exception or the product testing exception. In contrast, the private label credit card exception and the product testing exception provide that a card issuer is not required to submit to the Board agreements offered solely in connection with certain types of credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, regardless of the card issuer's total number of open accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. De minimis exception. Under Sec. 226.58(c)(5), a card issuer is not required to submit any credit card agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. For example, a card issuer offers five credit card agreements to the public as of September 30. However, the card issuer has only 2,000 open credit card accounts as of September 30. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board by October 31 because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date for determining whether card issuer qualifies clarified. Whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception is determined as of the last business day of each calendar quarter. For example, as of December 31, a card issuer offers three agreements to the public and has 9,500 open credit card accounts. As of January 30, the card issuer still offers three agreements, but has 10,100 open accounts. As of March 31, the card issuer still offers three agreements, but has only 9,700 open accounts. Even though the card issuer had 10,100 open accounts at one time during the calendar quarter, the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception because the number of open accounts was less than 10,000 as of March 31. The card issuer therefore is not required to submit any agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) by April 30.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date for determining whether card issuer ceases to qualify clarified. Whether a card issuer has ceased to qualify for the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last business day of the calendar quarter, For example, as of June 30, a card issuer offers three agreements to the public and has 9,500 open credit card accounts. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) because the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception. As of July 15, the card issuer still offers the same three agreements, but now has 10,000 open accounts. The card issuer is not required to take any action at this time, because whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. As of September 30, the card issuer still offers the same three agreements and still has 10,000 open accounts. Because the card issuer had 10,000 open accounts as of September 30, the card issuer ceased to qualify for the de minimis exception and must submit the three agreements it offers to the Board by October 31, the next quarterly submission deadline.</p><p class="depth0">5. Option to withdraw agreements clarified. Section 226.58(c)(5) provides that if a card issuer that did not previously qualify for the de minimis exception qualifies for the de minimis exception, the card issuer must continue to make quarterly submissions to the Board as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(1) until the card issuer notifies the Board that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously submitted to the Board. For example, a card issuer has 10,001 open accounts and offers three agreements to the public as of December 31. The card issuer has submitted each of the three agreements to the Board as required under Sec. 226.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer has only 9,999 open accounts. The card issuer has two options. First, the card issuer may notify the Board that the card issuer is withdrawing each of the three agreements it previously submitted. Once the card issuer has notified the Board, the card issuer is no longer required to make quarterly submissions to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1). Alternatively, the card issuer may choose not to notify the Board that it is withdrawing its agreements. In this case, the card issuer must continue making quarterly submissions to the Board as required by Sec. 226.58(c)(1). The card issuer might choose not to withdraw its agreements if, for example, the card issuer believes that it likely

will cease to qualify for the de minimis exception again in the near future.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(6) Private label credit card exception.</p><p class="depth0">1. Private label credit card exception. Under Sec. 226.58(c)(6)(i), a card issuer is not required to submit to the Board a credit card agreement if, as of the last business day of the calendar quarter, the agreement: (A) Is offered for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts; and (B) is not offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers to the public a credit card agreement offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards that can be used only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 8,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer is not required to submit this agreement to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) because the agreement is offered for a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the credit card agreement is not offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">In contrast, assume the same card issuer also offers to the public a different credit card agreement that is offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The card issuer has 12,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The private label credit card exception does not apply. Although this agreement is offered for a private label credit card plan (i.e., the 12,000 private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B), and the agreement is not offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan, the private label credit card plan has more than 10,000 open accounts. (The card issuer still is not required to submit to the Board the agreement offered in connection with credit cards usable only at Merchant A, as each agreement is evaluated separately under the private label credit card exception.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Card issuers with small private label and other credit card plans. Whether the private label credit card exception applies is determined on an agreement-by-agreement basis. Therefore, some agreements offered by a card issuer may qualify for the private label credit card exception even though the card issuer also offers other agreements that do not qualify, such as agreements offered for accounts with cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants or agreements offered for accounts under private label plans with 10,000 or more open accounts.</p><p class="depth0">3. De minimis exception distinguished. The private label credit card exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6) is distinct from the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5). The private label credit card exception exempts card issuers from submitting certain agreements to the Board regardless of the card issuer's overall size as measured by total number of open accounts. In contrast, the de minimis exception exempts a particular card issuer from submitting any credit card agreements to the Board if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 total open accounts. For example, a card issuer offers to the public two credit card agreements. Agreement A is offered solely for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 5,000 open credit card accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant A. Agreement B is offered solely for credit card accounts with cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants that participate in a major payment network. The card issuer has 40,000 open credit card accounts with such payment network cards. The card issuer is not required to submit agreement A to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) because agreement A qualifies for the private label credit card exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6). Agreement A is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts (i.e., the 5,000 accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A) and is not otherwise offered to the public. The card issuer is required to submit agreement B to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1). The card issuer does not qualify for the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5) because it has more than 10,000 open accounts, and agreement B does not qualify for the private label credit card exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6) because it is not offered solely for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts.</p><p class="depth0">4. Agreement otherwise offered to the public. An agreement qualifies for the private label exception only if it is offered for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open accounts and is not offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers a single agreement to the public. The agreement is offered for private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 9,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The agreement also is offered for credit card accounts with credit cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants that participate in a major payment network. The agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception. The agreement is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts. However, the agreement also is offered to the public for accounts that are not part of a private label credit card plan and therefore does not qualify for the private label credit card exception.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, an agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception if

it is offered in connection with one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts and one private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts. For example, a card issuer offers a single credit card agreement to the public. The agreement is offered for two types of accounts. The first type of account is a private label credit card account with a credit card usable only at Merchant A. The second type of account is a private label credit card account with a credit card usable only at Merchant B. The card issuer has 10,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 5,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B. The agreement does not qualify for the private label credit card exception. While the agreement is offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts (i.e., the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B), the agreement is also offered for accounts not under such a plan (i.e., the 10,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A).</p><p class="depth0">5. Agreement used for multiple small private label plans. The private label exception applies even if the same agreement is used for more than one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts. For example, a card issuer has 15,000 total open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 7,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A, 5,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B, and 3,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant C. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for all three types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account. The card issuer is not required to submit the agreement to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1). The agreement is used for three different private label credit card plans (i.e., the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A, the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B, and the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant C), each of which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts, and the card issuer does not offer the agreement for any other type of account. The agreement therefore qualifies for the private label credit card exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple agreements used for one private label credit card plan. The private label credit card exception applies even if a card issuer offers more than one agreement in connection with a particular private label credit card plan. For example, a card issuer has 5,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer offers to the public three different agreements each of which may be used in connection with private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The agreements are not offered for any other type of credit card account. The card issuer is not required to submit any of the three agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1) because each of the agreements is used for a private label credit card plan which has fewer than 10,000 open accounts and none of the three is offered to the public other than for accounts under such a plan.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(8) Form and content of agreements submitted to the Board.</p><p class="depth0">1. ``As of'' date clarified. Agreements submitted to the Board must contain the provisions of the agreement and pricing information in effect as of the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter. For example, on June 1, a card issuer decides to decrease the purchase APR associated with one of the agreements it offers to the public. The change in the APR will become effective on August 1. If the card issuer submits the agreement to the Board on July 31 (for example, because the agreement has been otherwise amended), the agreement submitted should not include the new lower APR because that APR was not in effect on June 30, the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">2. Pricing agreement addendum. Pricing information must be set forth in the separate addendum described in Sec. 226.58(c)(8)(ii)(A) even if it is also stated elsewhere in the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Pricing agreement variations do not constitute separate agreements. Pricing information that may vary from one cardholder to another depending on the cardholder's creditworthiness or state of residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the possible variations or by providing a range of possible variations. Two agreements that differ only with respect to variations in the pricing information do not constitute separate agreements for purposes of this section. For example, a card issuer offers two types of credit card accounts that differ only with respect to the purchase APR. The purchase APR for one type of account is 15 percent, while the purchase APR for the other type of account is 18 percent. The provisions of the agreement and pricing information for the two types of accounts are otherwise identical. The card issuer should not submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing a 15 percent purchase APR and another agreement with a pricing information addendum listing an 18 percent purchase APR. Instead, the card issuer should submit to the Board one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing possible purchase APRs of 15 or 18 percent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Optional variable terms addendum. Examples of provisions that might be included in the variable terms addendum include a clause that is required by law to be included in credit card agreements in a particular

state but not in other states (unless, for example, a clause is included in the agreement used for all cardholders under a heading such as ``For State X Residents''), the name of the credit card plan to which the agreement applies (if this information is included in the agreement), or the name of a charitable organization to which donations will be made in connection with a particular card (if this information is included in the agreement).</p><p class="depth0">5. Integrated agreement requirement. Card issuers may not provide provisions of the agreement or pricing information in the form of change-in-terms notices or riders. The only two addenda that may be submitted as part of an agreement are the pricing information addendum and optional variable terms addendum described in Sec. 226.58(c)(8). Changes in provisions or pricing information must be integrated into the body of the agreement, pricing information addendum, or optional variable terms addendum described in Sec. 226.58(c)(8). For example, it would be impermissible for a card issuer to submit to the Board an agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document dated January 1, 2005, four subsequent change in terms notices, and 2 addenda showing variations in pricing information. Instead, the card issuer must submit a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change in terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions document and a single addendum displaying variations in pricing information.</p><p class="depth0">58(d) Posting of agreements offered to the public.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement applies only to agreements submitted to the Board. Card issuers are only required to post and maintain on their publicly available Web site the credit card agreements that the card issuer must submit to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c). If, for example, a card issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Board because the card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under Sec. 226.58(d). Similarly, if a card issuer is not required to submit a specific agreement to the Board, such as an agreement that qualifies for the private label exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(6), the card issuer is not required to post and maintain that agreement under Sec. 226.58(d) (either on the card issuer's publicly available Web site or on the publicly available Web sites of merchants at which private label credit cards can be used). (The card issuer in both of these cases is still required to provide each individual cardholder with access to his or her specific credit card agreement under Sec. 226.58(e) by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the cardholder's request.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Card issuers that do not otherwise maintain Web sites. Unlike Sec. 226.58(e), Sec. 226.58(d) does not include a special rule for card issuers that do not otherwise maintain a Web site. If a card issuer is required to submit one or more agreements to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c), that card issuer must post those agreements on a publicly available Web site it maintains (or, with respect to an agreement for a private label credit card, on the publicly available Web site of at least one of the merchants at which the card may be used, as provided in Sec. 226.58(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">If an issuer provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of Sec. 226.58. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.58(d) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide cardholders with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site can comply with Sec. 226.58(d) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Board are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with Sec. 226.58(d). (In contrast, the Sec. 226.58(d)(1) rule regarding agreements for private label credit cards is not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific information through the merchant's Web site.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Private label credit card plans. Section 226.58(d) provides that, with respect to an agreement offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, a card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the Web site of at least one of the merchants at which the cards issued under each private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. For example, a card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 75,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 25,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for both of these types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of account.</p><p class="depth0">The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c)(1).

However, because the agreement is offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card plans, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 226.58(d) in either of two ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site. Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant A and the publicly available Web site of at least one of Merchants B, C and D. It would not be sufficient for the card issuer to post the agreement on Merchant A's Web site alone because Sec. 226.58(d) requires the card issuer to post the agreement on the publicly available Web site of ``at least one of the merchants at which cards issued under each private label credit card plan may be used'' (emphasis added).</p><p class="depth0">In contrast, assume that a card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of these, 5,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 95,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D.

Requirement applies to all open accounts. The requirement to provide access to credit card agreements under Sec. 226.58(e) applies to all open credit card accounts, regardless of whether such agreements are required to be submitted to the Board pursuant to Sec. 226.58(c) (or posted on the card issuer's Web site pursuant to Sec. 226.58(d)). For example, a card issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Board because it qualifies for the de minimis exception under Sec. 226.58(c)(5)) would still be required to provide cardholders with access to their specific agreements under Sec. 226.58(e). Similarly, an agreement that is no longer offered to the public would not be required to be submitted to the Board under Sec. 226.58(c), but would still need to be provided to the cardholder to whom it applies under Sec. 226.58(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. Readily available telephone line. Section 226.58(e) provides that card issuers that provide copies of cardholder agreements upon request must provide the cardholder with the ability to request a copy of their agreement by calling a readily available telephone line. To satisfy the readily available standard, the financial institution must provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt response. The institution need only provide telephone service during normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside the area where it normally conducts business.</p><p class="depth0">3. Issuers without interactive Web sites. Section 226.58(e)(2) provides that a card issuer that does not maintain a Web site from which cardholders can access specific information about their individual accounts is

not required to provide a cardholder with the ability to request a copy of the agreement by using the card issuer's Web site. A card issuer without a Web site of any kind could comply by disclosing the telephone number on each periodic statement; a card issuer with a non-interactive Web site could comply in the same way, or alternatively could comply by displaying the telephone number on the card issuer's Web site. An issuer is considered to maintain an interactive Web site for purposes of the Sec. 226.58(e)(2) special rule if the issuer provide cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party interactive Web site. Such a Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 226.58(e)(2) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. An issuer that provides cardholders with access to specific information about their individual accounts through such a Web site is not permitted to comply with the special rule in Sec. 226.58(e)(2). Instead, such an issuer must comply with Sec. 226.58(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">4. Deadline for providing requested agreements clarified. Sections 226.58(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2) require that credit card agreements provided upon request must be sent to the cardholder or otherwise made available to the cardholder in electronic or paper form no later than 30 days after the cardholder's request is received. For example, if a card issuer chooses to respond to a cardholder's request by mailing a paper copy of the cardholder's agreement, the card issuer must mail the agreement no later than 30 days after receipt of the cardholder's request. Alternatively, if a card issuer chooses to respond to a cardholder's request by posting the cardholder's agreement on the card issuer's Web site, the card issuer must post the agreement on its Web site no later than 30 days after receipt of the cardholder's request. Section 226.58(e)(3)(v) provides that a card issuer may provide cardholder agreements in either electronic or paper form regardless of the form of the cardholder's request.</p><p class="depth0">Section 226.59-Reevaluation of Rate Increases.</p><p class="depth0">59(a) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(1) Evaluation of increased rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Types of rate increases covered. Section 226.59(a) applies both to increases in annual percentage rates imposed on a consumer's account based on that consumer's credit risk or other circumstances specific to that consumer and to increases in annual percentage rates imposed based on factors that are not specific to the consumer, such as changes in market conditions or the issuer's cost of funds.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rate increases actually imposed. Under Sec. 226.59(a), a card issuer must review changes in factors only if the increased rate is actually imposed on the consumer's account. For example, if a card issuer increases the penalty rate for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and the consumer's account has no balances that are currently subject to the penalty rate, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) of the change in terms, but the requirements of Sec. 226.59 do not apply. However, if the consumer's account later becomes subject to the penalty rate, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(g) and the requirements of Sec. 226.59 begin to apply upon imposition of the penalty rate. Similarly, if a card issuer raises the cash advance rate applicable to a consumer's account but the consumer engages in no cash advance transactions to which that increased rate is applied, the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c) of the change in terms, but the requirements of Sec. 226.59 do not apply. If the consumer subsequently engages in a cash advance transaction, the requirements of Sec. 226.59 begin to apply at that time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in type of rate. i. Generally. A change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable rate is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59, if the rate in effect immediately prior to the change in type of rate is equal to or greater than the rate in effect immediately after the change. For example, a change from a variable rate of 15.99% to a non-variable rate of 15.99% is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59 at the time of the change. See Sec. 226.55 for limitations on the permissibility of changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Change from non-variable rate to variable rate. A change from a non-variable to a variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59 if the variable rate exceeds the non-variable rate that would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 12% applies to all transactions on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days' advance notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2), the rate on all new transactions is changed to a variable rate that is currently 12% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's

control. The change from the 12% non-variable rate to the 12% variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59(a). On April 1 of year 2, the value of the variable rate increases to 12.5%. The increase in the rate from 12% to 12.5% is a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59, and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting reviews of the account pursuant to Sec. 226.59. The increase that must be evaluated for purposes of Sec. 226.59 is the increase from a non-variable rate of 12% to a variable rate of 12.5%.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Change from variable rate to non-variable rate. A change from a variable to a non-variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59 if the non-variable rate exceeds the variable rate that would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 15% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's control applies to all transactions on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days' advance notice pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2), the rate on all existing balances and new transactions is changed to a non-variable rate that is currently 15%. The change from the 15% variable rate to the 15% non-variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59(a). On April 1 of year 2, the value of the variable rate that would have applied to the account decreases to 12.5%. Accordingly, on April 1 of year 2, the non-variable rate of 15% exceeds the 12.5% variable rate that would have applied but for the change in type of rate. At this time, the change to the non-variable rate of 15% constitutes a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 226.59, and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting reviews of the account pursuant to Sec. 226.59. The increase that must be evaluated for purposes of Sec. 226.59 is the increase from a variable rate of 12.5% to a non-variable rate of 15%.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rate increases prior to effective date of rule. For increases in annual percentage rates made on or after January 1, 2009, and prior to August 22, 2010, Sec. 226.59(a) requires the card issuer to review the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d) and reduce the rate, as appropriate, if the rate increase is of a type for which 45 days' advance notice would currently be required under Sec. 226.9(c)(2) or (g). For example, 45 days' notice is not required under Sec. 226.9(c)(2) if the rate increase results from the increase in the index by which a properly-disclosed variable rate is determined in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(C) or if the increase occurs upon expiration of a specified period of time and disclosures complying with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) have been provided. The requirements of Sec. 226.59 do not apply to such rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Amount of rate decrease. i. General. Even in circumstances where a rate reduction is required, Sec. 226.59 does not require that a card issuer decrease the rate that applies to a credit card account to the rate that was in effect prior to the rate increase subject to Sec. 226.59(a). The amount of the rate decrease that is required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and procedures under Sec. 226.59(b) for consideration of factors described in Sec. 226.59(a) and (d). For example, assume a consumer's rate on new purchases is increased from a variable rate of 15.99% to a variable rate of 23.99% based on the consumer's making a required minimum periodic payment five days late. The consumer makes all of the payments required on the account on time for the six months following the rate increase. Assume that the card issuer evaluates the account by reviewing the factors on which the increase in an annual percentage rate was originally based, in accordance with Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(i). The card issuer is not required to decrease the consumer's rate to the 15.99% that applied prior to the rate increase. However, the card issuer's policies and procedures for performing the review required by Sec. 226.59(a) must be reasonable, as required by Sec. 226.59(b), and must take into account any reduction in the consumer's credit risk based upon the consumer's timely payments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Change in type of rate. If the rate increase subject to Sec. 226.59 involves a change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, Sec. 226.59 does not require that the issuer reinstate the same type of rate that applied prior to the change. However, the amount of any rate decrease that is required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and procedures under Sec. 226.59(b) for consideration of factors described in Sec. 226.59(a) and (d).</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(2) Rate reductions.</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(2)(ii) Applicability of rate reduction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability of reduced rate to new transactions. Section 226.59(a)(2)(ii) requires, in part, that any reduction in rate required pursuant to Sec. 226.59(a)(1) must apply to new transactions that occur after the effective date of the rate reduction, if those transactions would otherwise have been subject to the increased rate described in Sec. 226.59(a)(1). A credit card account may have multiple types of balances, for example, purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers, to which different rates apply. For example, assume a new credit card account opened on January 1 of year one has a rate applicable to purchases of 15% and a rate applicable to cash advances and balance transfers of 20%. Effective March 1 of year two, consistent

with the limitations in Sec. 226.55 and upon giving notice required by Sec. 226.9(c)(2), the card issuer raises the rate applicable to new purchases to 18% based on market conditions. The only transaction in which the consumer engages in year two is a $1,000 purchase made on July 1. The rate for cash advances and balance transfers remains at 20%. Based on a subsequent review required by Sec. 226.59(a)(1), the card issuer determines that the rate on purchases must be reduced to 16%. Section 226.59(a)(2)(ii) requires that the 16% rate be applied to the $1,000 purchase made on July 1 and to all new purchases. The rate for new cash advances and balance transfers may remain at 20%, because there was no rate increase applicable to those types of transactions and, therefore, the requirements of Sec. 226.59(a) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">59(c) Timing.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. The issuer may review all of its accounts subject to Sec. 226.59(a) at the same time once every six months, may review each account once each six months on a rolling basis based on the date on which the rate was increased for that account, or may otherwise review each account not less frequently than once every six months.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. A card issuer increases the rates applicable to one half of its credit card accounts on June 1, 2011. The card issuer increases the rates applicable to the other half of its credit card accounts on September 1, 2011. The card issuer may review the rate increases for all of its credit card accounts on or before December 1, 2011, and at least every six months thereafter. In the alternative, the card issuer may first review the rate increases for the accounts that were repriced on June 1, 2011 on or before December 1, 2011, and may first review the rate increases for the accounts that were repriced on September 1, 2011 on or before March 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate increases prior to effective date of rule. For increases in annual percentage rates applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on or after January 1, 2009 and prior to August 22, 2010, Sec. 226.59(c) requires that the first review for such rate increases be conducted prior to February 22, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">59(d) Factors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in factors. A creditor that complies with Sec. 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts may change those factors from time to time. When a creditor changes the factors it considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts from time to time, it may comply with Sec. 226.59(a) by reviewing the set of factors it considered immediately prior to the change in factors for a brief transition period, or may consider the new factors. For example, a creditor changes the factors it uses to determine the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts on January 1, 2012. The creditor reviews the rates applicable to its existing accounts that have been subject to a rate increase pursuant to Sec. 226.59(a) on January 25, 2012. The creditor complies with Sec. 226.59(a) by reviewing, at its option, either the factors that it considered on December 31, 2011 when determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts or the factors that it considers as of January 25, 2012. For purposes of compliance with Sec. 226.59(d), a transition period of 60 days from the change of factors constitutes a brief transition period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparison of existing account to factors used for similar new accounts. Under Sec. 226.59(a), if a creditor evaluates an existing account using the same factors that it considers in determining the rates applicable to similar new accounts, the review of factors need not result in existing accounts being subject to exactly the same rates and rate structure as a creditor imposes on similar new accounts. For example, a creditor may offer variable rates on similar new accounts that are computed by adding a margin that depends on various factors to the value of the LIBOR index. The account that the creditor is required to review pursuant to Sec. 226.59(a) may have variable rates that were determined by adding a different margin, depending on different factors, to a published prime rate. In performing the review required by Sec. 226.59(a), the creditor may review the factors it uses to determine the rates applicable to similar new accounts. If a rate reduction is required, however, the creditor need not base the variable rate for the existing account on the LIBOR index but may continue to use the published prime rate. Section 226.59(a) requires, however, that the rate on the existing account after the reduction, as determined by adding the published prime rate and margin, be comparable to the rate, as determined by adding the margin and LIBOR, charged on a new account for which the factors are comparable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Similar new credit card accounts. A card issuer complying with Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) is required to consider the factors that the card issuer currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. For example, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to credit card plans for which the consumer pays an annual fee and receives rewards points than it reviews in determining the rates for credit card plans with no annual fee and no rewards points. Similarly, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to private label credit cards than it reviews in determining the rates applicable to credit cards that can

be used at a wider variety of merchants. In addition, a card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that applies to private label credit cards usable only at Merchant A than it may review for private label credit cards usable only at Merchant B. However, Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) requires a card issuer to review the factors it considers when determining the rates for new credit card accounts with similar features that are offered for similar purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. No similar new credit card accounts. In some circumstances, a card issuer that complies with Sec. 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors that it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new accounts may not be able to identify a class of new accounts that are similar to the existing accounts on which a rate increase has been imposed. For example, consumers may have existing credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan but the card issuer may no longer offer a product to new consumers with similar characteristics, such as the availability of rewards, size of credit line, or other features. Similarly, some consumers' accounts may have been closed and therefore cannot be used for new transactions, while all new accounts can be used for new transactions. In those circumstances, Sec. 226.59 requires that the card issuer nonetheless perform a review of the rate increase on the existing customers' accounts. A card issuer does not comply with Sec. 226.59 by maintaining an increased rate without performing such an evaluation. In such circumstances, Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) requires that the card issuer compare the existing accounts to the most closely comparable new accounts that it offers.</p><p class="depth0">5. Consideration of consumer's conduct on existing account. A card issuer that complies with Sec. 226.59(a) by reviewing the factors that it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new accounts may consider the consumer's payment or other account behavior on the existing account only to the same extent and in the same manner that the issuer considers such information when one of its current cardholders applies for a new account with the card issuer. For example, a card issuer might obtain consumer reports for all of its applicants. The consumer reports contain certain information regarding the applicant's past performance on existing credit card accounts. However, the card issuer may have additional information about an existing cardholder's payment history or account usage that does not appear in the consumer report and that, accordingly, it would not generally have for all new applicants. For example, a consumer may have made a payment that is five days late on his or her account with the card issuer, but this information does not appear on the consumer report. The card issuer may consider this additional information in performing its review under Sec. 226.59(a), but only to the extent and in the manner that it considers such information if a current cardholder applies for a new account with the issuer.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple rate increases between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010. i. General. Section 226.59(d)(2) applies if an issuer increased the rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010, and the increase was not based solely upon factors specific to the consumer. In some cases, a credit card account may have been subject to multiple rate increases during the period from January 1, 2009 to February 21, 2010. Some such rate increases may have been based solely upon factors specific to the consumer, while others may have been based on factors not specific to the consumer, such as the issuer's cost of funds or market conditions. In such circumstances, when conducting the first two reviews required under Sec. 226.59, the card issuer may separately review: (i) Rate increases imposed based on factors not specific to the consumer, using the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by Sec. 226.59(d)(2)); and (ii) rate increases imposed based on consumer-specific factors, using the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(i). If the review of factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(i) indicates that it is appropriate to continue to apply a penalty or other increased rate to the account as a result of the consumer's payment history or other factors specific to the consumer, Sec. 226.59 permits the card issuer to continue to impose the penalty or other increased rate, even if the review of the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) would otherwise require a rate decrease.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume a credit card account was subject to a rate of 15% on all transactions as of January 1, 2009. On May 1, 2009, the issuer increased the rate on existing balances and new transactions to 18%, based upon market conditions or other factors not specific to the consumer or the consumer's account. Subsequently, on September 1, 2009, based on a payment that was received five days after the due date, the issuer increased the applicable rate on existing balances and new transactions from 18% to a penalty rate of 25%. When conducting the first review required under Sec. 226.59, the card issuer reviews the rate increase from 15% to 18% using the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by Sec. 226.59(d)(2)), and separately but concurrently reviews the rate increase from 18% to 25% using the factors described in paragraph Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(i). The review of the rate increase from 15% to 18% based upon the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii) indicates that a similarly situated new consumer would receive a rate of 17%. The review of the rate increase from 18% to 25% based

upon the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(i) indicates that it is appropriate to continue to apply the 25% penalty rate based upon the consumer's late payment. Section 226.59 permits the rate on the account to remain at 25%.</p><p class="depth0">59(f) Termination of obligation to review factors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Revocation of temporary rates. i. In general. If an annual percentage rate is increased due to revocation of a temporary rate, Sec. 226.59(a) requires that the card issuer periodically review the increased rate. In contrast, if the rate increase results from the expiration of a temporary rate previously disclosed in accordance with Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B), the review requirements in Sec. 226.59(a) do not apply. If a temporary rate is revoked such that the requirements of Sec. 226.59(a) apply, Sec. 226.59(f) permits an issuer to terminate the review of the rate increase if and when the applicable rate is the same as the rate that would have applied if the increase had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. Assume that on January 1, 2011, a consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 15%. The card issuer offers the consumer a 10% rate on purchases made between February 1, 2012 and August 1, 2013 and discloses pursuant to Sec. 226.9(c)(2)(v)(B) that on August 1, 2013 the rate on purchases will revert to the original 15% rate. The consumer makes a payment that is five days late in July 2012.</p><p class="depth0">A. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice and to the extent permitted under Sec. 226.55, the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to 15%, effective on September 1, 2012. The card issuer must review that rate increase under Sec. 226.59(a) at least once each six months during the period from September 1, 2012 to August 1, 2013, unless and until the card issuer reduces the rate to 10%. The card issuer performs reviews of the rate increase on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 15%. Beginning on August 1, 2013, the card issuer is not required to continue periodically reviewing the rate increase, because if the temporary rate had expired in accordance with its previously disclosed terms, the 15% rate would have applied to purchase balances as of August 1, 2013 even if the rate increase had not occurred on September 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above except that the review conducted on July 1, 2013 indicates that a reduction to the original temporary rate of 10% is appropriate. Section 226.59(a)(2)(i) requires that the rate be reduced no later than 45 days after completion of the review, or no later than August 15, 2013. Because the temporary rate would have expired prior to the date on which the rate decrease is required to take effect, the card issuer may, at its option, reduce the rate to 10% for any portion of the period from July 1, 2013, to August 1, 2013, or may continue to impose the 15% rate for that entire period. The card issuer is not required to conduct further reviews of the 15% rate on purchases.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as above except that on September 1, 2012 the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to the penalty rate on the consumer's account, which is 25%. The card issuer conducts reviews of the increased rate in accordance with Sec. 226.59 on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 25%. The card issuer's obligation to review the rate increase continues to apply after August 1, 2013, because the 25% penalty rate exceeds the 15% rate that would have applied if the temporary rate expired in accordance with its previously disclosed terms. The card issuer's obligation to review the rate terminates if and when the annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is reduced to the 15% rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example--relationship to Sec. 226.59(a). Assume that on January 1, 2011, a consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 15%. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice and to the extent permitted under Sec. 226.55, the card issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to 18%, effective on September 1, 2012. The card issuer conducts reviews of the increased rate in accordance with Sec. 226.59 on January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013, based on the factors described in Sec. 226.59(d)(1)(ii). Based on the January 1, 2013 review, the rate applicable to purchases remains at 18%. In the review conducted on July 1, 2013, the card issuer determines that, based on the relevant factors, the rate it would offer on a comparable new account would be 14%. Consistent with Sec. 226.59(f), Sec. 226.59(a) requires that the card issuer reduce the rate on the existing account to the 15% rate that was in effect prior to the September 1, 2012 rate increase.</p><p class="depth0">59(g) Acquired accounts.</p><p class="depth0">59(g)(1) General.</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 226.59(d)(2) for rate increases imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010. Section 226.59(d)(2) applies to acquired accounts. Accordingly, if a card issuer acquires accounts on which a rate increase was imposed between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010 that was not based solely upon consumer-specific factors, that acquiring card issuer must consider the factors that it currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts, if it conducts either or both of the first two reviews of such accounts that are required after August 22, 2010 under Sec. 226.59(a).</p><p class="depth0">59(g)(2) Review of acquired portfolio.</p><p class="depth0">1. Example--general. A card issuer acquires a portfolio of accounts that currently are subject to annual percentage rates of 12%, 15%, and 18%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in accordance with the factors that it currently uses in determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts. As a result of that review, the card issuer decreases the rate on the accounts that are currently subject to a 12% annual percentage rate to 10%, leaves the rate applicable to the accounts currently subject to a 15% annual percentage rate at 15%, and increases the rate applicable to the accounts currently subject to a rate of 18% to 20%. Section 226.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to review, no less frequently than once every six months, the accounts for which the rate has been increased to 20%. The card issuer is not required to review the accounts subject to 10% and 15% rates pursuant to Sec. 226.59(a), unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent rate increase applicable to those accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example--penalty rates. A card issuer acquires a portfolio of accounts that currently are subject to standard annual percentage rates of 12% and 15%. In addition, several acquired accounts are subject to a penalty rate of 24%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts, the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in accordance with the factors that it currently uses in determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts. As a result of that review, the card issuer leaves the standard rates applicable to the accounts at 12% and 15%, respectively. The card issuer decreases the rate applicable to the accounts currently at 24% to its penalty rate of 23%. Section 226.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to review, no less frequently than once every six months, the accounts that are subject to a penalty rate of 23%. The card issuer is not required to review the accounts subject to 12% and 15% rates pursuant to Sec. 226.59(a), unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent rate increase applicable to those accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A--Effect on State Laws</p><p class="depth0">1.

General rule. Appendix D provides a special procedure that creditors may use, at their option, to estimate and disclose the terms of multiple-advance construction loans when the amounts or timing of advances is unknown at consummation of the transaction. This appendix reflects the approach taken in Sec. 226.17(c)(6)(ii), which permits creditors to provide separate or combined disclosures for the construction period and for the permanent financing, if any; i.e., the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as one transaction or more than one transaction. Appendix D may also be used in multiple-advance transactions other than construction loans, when the amounts or timing of advances is unknown at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate multiple-advance loans. The hypothetical disclosure required in variable-

rate transactions by Sec. 226.18(f)(1)(iv) is not required for multiple-advance loans disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part I.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculation of the total of payments. When disclosures are made pursuant to appendix D, the total of payments may reflect either the sum of the payments or the sum of the amount financed and the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Annual percentage rate. Appendix D does not require the use of Volume I of the Board's Annual Percentage Rate Tables for calculation of the annual percentage rate. Creditors utilizing appendix D in making calculations and disclosures may use other computation tools to determine the estimated annual percentage rate, based on the finance charge and payment schedule obtained by use of the appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. Interest reserves. In a multiple-advance construction loan, a creditor may establish an ``interest reserve'' to ensure that interest is paid as it accrues by designating a portion of the loan to be used for paying the interest that accrues on the loan. An interest reserve is not treated as a prepaid finance charge, whether the interest reserve is the same as or different from the estimated interest figure calculated under appendix D.</p><p class="depth0">If a creditor permits a consumer to make interest payments as they become due, the interest reserve should be disregarded in the disclosures and calculations under appendix D.</p><p class="depth0">If a creditor requires the establishment of an interest reserve and automatically deducts interest payments from the reserve amount rather than allow the consumer to make interest payments as they become due, the fact that interest will accrue on those interest payments as well as the other loan proceeds must be reflected in the calculations and disclosures. To reflect the effects of such compounding, a creditor should first calculate interest on the commitment amount (exclusive of the interest reserve) and then add the figure obtained by assuming that one-half of that interest is outstanding at the contract interest rate for the entire construction period. For example, using the example shown under paragraph A, part I of appendix D, the estimated interest would be $1,117.68 ($1093.75 plus an additional $23.93 calculated by assuming half of $1093.75 is outstanding at the contract interest rate for the entire construction period), and the estimated annual percentage rate would be 21.18%.</p><p class="depth0">6. Relation to Sec. 226.18(s). A creditor must disclose an interest rate and payment summary table for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, pursuant to Sec. 226.18(s), instead of the general payment schedule required by Sec. 226.18(g). Accordingly, home construction loans that are secured by real property or a dwelling are subject to Sec. 226.18(s) and not Sec. 226.18(g). Under Sec. 226.176(c)(6)(ii), when a multiple-advance construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor uses Appendix D and elects pursuant to Sec. 226.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed according to the rules in Sec. 226.18(s). Under Sec. 226.18(s), the creditor must disclose the applicable interest rates and corresponding periodic payments during the construction phase in an interest rate and payment summary table. The provision in Appendix D, Part I.A.3, which allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments ``in disclosing the payment schedule under Sec. 226.18(g)'' does not apply because the transaction is governed by Sec. 226.18(s) rather than Sec. 226.18(g). Also, because the construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its terms do not repay all principal, the creditor must disclose a balloon payment, pursuant to Sec. 226.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, the construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to Appendix D, Part II.C, which provides that the creditor shall disclose the repayment schedule without reflecting the number or amounts of payments of interest only that are made during the construction phase. Appendix D also provides, however, that creditors must disclose (outside of the table) the fact that interest payments must be made and the timing of such payments. The rate and payment summary table disclosed under Sec. 226.18(s) must reflect only the permanent phase of the transaction. Therefore, in determining the rates and payments that must be disclosed in the columns of the table, creditors should apply the requirements of Sec. 226.18(s) to the permanent phase only. For example, under Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(A) or Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(i)(B)(1), as applicable, the creditor should disclose the interest rate corresponding to the first installment due under the permanent phase and not any rate applicable during the construction phase.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: None.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.17 and 226.22.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Interpretation Sec. 226.813.</p><p class="depth0">1981 Changes: The use of appendix D is limited to multiple-advance loans for construction purposes or analogous types of transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix E--Rules for Card Issuers That Bill on a Transaction-by-</p><p class="depth0">Transaction Basis</p><p class="depth0">Statute: None.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Interpretation Sec. 226.709.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Sections 226.6 through 226.13, and 226.15.</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: The rules in this appendix have been streamlined and clarified to indicate how certain card issuers that bill on a transaction basis may comply with the requirements of Subpart B.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix F--Optional Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Creditors</p><p class="depth0">Offering Open-End Plans Subject to the Requirements of Sec. 226.5b</p><p class="depth0">1.

Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance under state law.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix G--Open-End Model Forms and Clauses</p><p class="depth0">1. Models G-1 and G-1(A). The model disclosures in G-1 and G-1(A) (different balance computation methods) may be used in both the account-opening disclosures under Sec. 226.6 and the periodic disclosures under Sec. 226.7. As is clear from the models given, ``shorthand'' descriptions of the balance computation methods are not sufficient, except where Sec. 226.7(b)(5) applies. For creditors using model G-1, the phrase ``a portion of'' the finance charge should be included if the total finance charge includes other amounts, such as transaction charges, that are not due to the application of a periodic rate. If unpaid interest or finance charges are subtracted in calculating the balance, that fact must be stated so that the disclosure of the computation method is accurate. Only model G-1(b) contains a final sentence appearing in brackets, which reflects the total dollar amount of payments and credits received during the billing cycle. The other models do not contain this language because they reflect plans in which payments and credits received during the billing cycle are subtracted. If this is not the case, however, the language relating to payments and credits should be changed, and the creditor should add either the disclosure of the dollar amount as in model G-1(b) or an indication of which credits (disclosed elsewhere on the periodic statement) will not be deducted in determining the balance. (Such an indication may also substitute for the bracketed sentence in model G-1(b).) (See the commentary to Sec. 226.7(a)(5) and (b)(5).) For open-end plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, creditors may, at their option, use the clauses in G-1 or G-1(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Models G-2 and G-2(A). These models contain the notice of liability for unauthorized use of a credit card. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may use G-2 or G-2(A). For open-end plans not subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, creditors properly use G-2(A).</p><p class="depth0">3. Models G-3, G-3(A), G-4 and G-4(A).</p><p class="depth0">i. These set out models for the long-form billing-error rights statement (for use with the account-opening disclosures and as an annual disclosure or, at the creditor's option, with each periodic statement) and the alternative billing-error rights statement (for use with each periodic statement), respectively. For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, at the creditor's option, a creditor either may use G-3 or G-3(A), and for creditors that use the short form, G-4 or G-4(A). For open-end (not home-secured) plans that not subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, creditors properly use G-3(A) and G-4(A). Creditors must provide the billing-error rights statements in a form substantially similar to the models in order to comply with the regulation. The model billing-rights statements may be modified in any of the ways set forth in the first paragraph to the commentary on appendices G and H. The models may, furthermore, be modified by deleting inapplicable information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. The paragraph concerning stopping a debit in relation to a disputed amount, if the creditor does not have the ability to debit automatically the consumer's savings or checking account for payment.</p><p class="depth0">B. The rights stated in the special rule for credit card purchases and any limitations on those rights.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The model billing rights statements also contain optional language that creditors may use. For example, the creditor may:</p><p class="depth0">A. Include a statement to the effect that notice of a billing error must be submitted on something other than the payment ticket or other material accompanying the periodic disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">B. Insert its address or refer to the address that appears elsewhere on the bill.</p><p class="depth0">C. Include instructions for consumers, at the consumer's option, to communicate with the creditor electronically or in writing.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Additional information may be included on the statements as long as it does not detract from the required disclosures. For instance, information concerning the reporting of errors in connection with a checking account may be included on a combined statement as long as the disclosures required by the regulation remain clear and conspicuous.</p><p class="depth0">4. Models G-5 through G-9. These models set out notices of the right to rescind that would be used at different times in an open-end plan. The last paragraph of each of the rescission model forms contains a blank for the date by which the consumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the situation in which the consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the transaction, for example, when the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or when the date of the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the commentary to section 226.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest disclosure for model form G-7.</p><p class="depth0">5. Model G-10(A), samples G-10(B) and G-10(C), model G-10(D), sample G-10(E), model G-17(A), and samples G-17(B), 17(C) and 17(D). i. Model G-10(A) and Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) illustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5a for applications and solicitations for credit cards

other than charge cards. Model G-10(D) and Sample G-10(E) illustrate the tabular format disclosure for charge card applications and solicitations and reflect the disclosures in the table. Model G-17(A) and Samples G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D) illustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under Sec. 226.6(b)(2) for account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially similar in sequence and format to Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A). While proper use of the model forms will be deemed in compliance with the regulation, card issuers and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are permitted to disclose the annual percentage rates for purchases, cash advances, or balance transfers in the same row in the table for any transaction types for which the issuer or creditor charges the same annual percentage rate. Similarly, card issuer and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are permitted to disclose fees of the same amount in the same row if the fees are in the same category. Fees in different categories may not be disclosed in the same row. For example, a transaction fee and a penalty fee that are of the same amount may not be disclosed in the same row. Card issuers and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are also permitted to use headings other than those in the forms if they are clear and concise and are substantially similar to the headings contained in model forms, with the following exceptions. The heading ``penalty APR'' must be used when describing rates that may increase due to default or delinquency or as a penalty, and in relation to required insurance, or debt cancellation or suspension coverage, the term ``required'' and the name of the product must be used. (See also Sec. Sec. 226.5a(b)(5) and 226.6(b)(2)(v) for guidance on headings that must be used to describe the grace period, or lack of grace period, in the disclosures required under Sec. 226.5a for applications and solicitations for credit cards other than charge cards, and the disclosures required under Sec. 226.6(b)(2) for account-opening disclosures, respectively.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Models G-10(A) and G-17(A) contain two alternative headings (``Minimum Interest Charge'' and ``Minimum Charge'') for disclosing a minimum interest or fixed finance charge under Sec. Sec. 226.5a(b)(3) and 226.6(b)(2)(iii). If a creditor imposes a minimum charge in lieu of interest in those months where a consumer would otherwise incur an interest charge but that interest charge is less than the minimum charge, the creditor should disclose this charge under the heading ``Minimum Interest Charge'' or a substantially similar heading. Other minimum or fixed finance charges should be disclosed under the heading ``Minimum Charge'' or a substantially similar heading.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A) contain two alternative headings (``Annual Fees'' and ``Set-up and Maintenance Fees'') for disclosing fees for issuance or availability of credit under Sec. 226.5a(b)(2) or Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii). If the only fee for issuance or availability of credit disclosed under Sec. 226.5a(b)(2) or Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii) is an annual fee, a creditor should use the heading ``Annual Fee'' or a substantially similar heading to disclose this fee. If a creditor imposes fees for issuance or availability of credit disclosed under Sec. 226.5a(b)(2) or Sec. 226.6(b)(2)(ii) other than, or in addition to, an annual fee, the creditor should use the heading ``Set-up and Maintenance Fees'' or a substantially similar heading to disclose fees for issuance or availability of credit, including the annual fee.</p><p class="depth0">v. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the Sec. Sec. 226.5a or 226.6(b)(1) and (2) disclosures, samples G-10(B), G-10(C), G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D) are designed to be printed on an 8\1/2\ x 14 inch sheet of paper. A creditor may use a smaller sheet of paper, such as 8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of paper. If the table is not provided on a single side of a sheet of paper, the creditor must include a reference or references, such as ``SEE BACK OF PAGE for more important information about your account.'' at the bottom of each page indicating that the table continues onto an additional page or pages. A creditor that splits the table onto two or more pages must disclose the table on consecutive pages and may not include any intervening information between portions of the table. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting the information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:</p><p class="depth0">A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Arial font style, except for the purchase annual percentage rate which is shown in 16-point type).</p><p class="depth0">B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adequate spacing between paragraphs when several pieces of information were included in the same row of the table, as appropriate. For example, in the samples in the row of the tables with the heading ``APR for Balance Transfers,'' the forms disclose two components: the applicable balance transfer rate and a cross reference to the balance transfer fee. The samples show these two components on separate lines with adequate space between each component. On the other hand, in the samples, in the disclosure of the late payment fee, the forms disclose two components: the late payment fee, and the cross reference to the penalty rate. Because the disclosure of both these components is short, these components are disclosed on the same line in the tables.</p><p class="depth0">D. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the text was not

compressed to appear smaller than 10-point type.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of the text.</p><p class="depth0">F. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.</p><p class="depth0">vi. While the Board is not requiring issuers to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the table (except for the 10-point and 16-point font requirement), the Board encourages issuers to consider these techniques when deciding how to disclose information in the table, to ensure that the information is presented in a readable format.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic techniques with respect to the table, so long as the table remains substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">6. Model G-11. Model G-11 contains clauses that illustrate the general disclosures required under Sec. 226.5a(e) in applications and solicitations made available to the general public.</p><p class="depth0">7. Models G-13(A) and G-13(B). These model forms illustrate the disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(f) when the card issuer changes the entity providing insurance on a credit card account. Model G-13(A) contains the items set forth in Sec. 226.9(f)(3) as examples of significant terms of coverage that may be affected by the change in insurance provider. The card issuer may either list all of these potential changes in coverage and place a check mark by the applicable changes, or list only the actual changes in coverage. Under either approach, the card issuer must either explain the changes or refer to an accompanying copy of the policy or group certificate for details of the new terms of coverage. Model G-13(A) also illustrates the permissible combination of the two notices required by Sec. 226.9(f)--the notice required for a planned change in provider and the notice required once a change has occurred. This form may be modified for use in providing only the disclosures required before the change if the card issuer chooses to send two separate notices. Thus, for example, the references to the attached policy or certificate would not be required in a separate notice prior to a change in the insurance provider since the policy or certificate need not be provided at that time. Model G-13(B) illustrates the disclosures required under Sec. 226.9(f)(2) when the insurance provider is changed.</p><p class="depth0">8. Samples G-18(A)-(D). For home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, if a creditor chooses to comply with the requirements in Sec. 226.7(b), the creditor may use Samples G-18(A) through G-18(D) to comply with these requirements, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">9. Samples G-18(D). Sample G-18(D) illustrates how credit card issuers may comply with proximity requirements for payment information on periodic statements. Creditors that offer card accounts with a charge card feature and a revolving feature may change the disclosure to make clear to which feature the disclosures apply.</p><p class="depth0">10. Forms G-18(F)-(G). Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) are intended as a compliance aid to illustrate front sides of a periodic statement, and how a periodic statement for open-end (not home-secured) plans might be designed to comply with the requirements of Sec. 226.7. The samples contain information that is not required by Regulation Z. The samples also present information in additional formats that are not required by Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the Sec. 226.7 disclosures. However, Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) are designed to be printed on an 8 x 14 inch sheet of paper.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The due date for a payment, if a late payment fee or penalty rate may be imposed, must appear on the front of the first page of the statement. See Sample G-18(D) that illustrates how a creditor may comply with proximity requirements for other disclosures. The payment information disclosures appear in the upper right-hand corner on Samples G-18(F) and G-18(G), but may be located elsewhere, as long as they appear on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. The summary of account activity presented on Samples G-18(F) and G-18(G) is not itself a required disclosure, although the previous balance and the new balance, presented in the summary, must be disclosed in a clear and conspicuous manner on periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Additional information not required by Regulation Z may be presented on the statement. The information need not be located in any particular place or be segregated from disclosures required by Regulation Z, although the effect of proximity requirements for required disclosures, such as the due date, may cause the additional information to be segregated from those disclosures required to be disclosed in close proximity to one another. Any additional information must be presented consistent with the creditor's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Model Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) demonstrate two examples of ways in which transactions could be presented on the periodic statement. Model Form G-18(G) presents transactions grouped by type and Model Form G-18(F) presents transactions in a list in chronological order. Neither of these approaches to presenting transactions is required; a creditor may present transactions differently, such as in a list grouped by authorized user or other means.</p><p class="depth0">11. Model Form G-19. See Sec. 226.9(b)(3) regarding the headings required to be disclosed when describing in the tabular disclosure a grace period (or lack of a grace period) offered on check transactions that access a credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">12. Sample G-24. Sample G-24 includes two model clauses for use in complying with Sec. 226.16(h)(4). Model clause (a) is for use in connection with credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. Model clause (b) is for use in connection with other open-end credit plans.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix H--Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses</p><p class="depth0">1. Models H-1 and H-2. Creditors may make several types of changes to closed-end model forms H-1 (credit sale) and H-2 (loan) and still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. Permissible changes include the addition of the information permitted by footnote 37 to Sec. 226.17 and ``directly related'' information as set forth in the commentary to Sec. 226.17(a).</p><p class="depth0">The creditor may also delete or, on multi-purpose forms, indicate inapplicable disclosures, such as:</p><p class="depth0">The itemization of the amount financed option. (See Samples H-12 through H-15.)</p><p class="depth0">The credit life and disability insurance disclosures. (See Samples H-11 and H-12.)</p><p class="depth0">The property insurance disclosures. (See Samples H-10 through H-12, and H-14.)</p><p class="depth0">The ``filing fees'' and ``non-filing insurance'' disclosures. (See Samples H-11 and H-12.)</p><p class="depth0">The prepayment penalty or rebate disclosures. (See Samples H-12 and H-14.)</p><p class="depth0">The total sale price. (See Samples H-11 through H-15.)</p><p class="depth0">Other permissible changes include:</p><p class="depth0">Adding the creditor's address or telephone number. (See the commentary to Sec. 226.18(a).)</p><p class="depth0">Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are the same, for instance, if the ``total of payments'' equals the ``total sale price.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 226.18.)</p><p class="depth0">Rearranging the sequence or location of the disclosures--for instance, by placing the descriptive phrases outside the boxes containing the corresponding disclosures, or by grouping the descriptors together as a glossary of terms in a separate section of the segregated disclosures; by placing the payment schedule at the top of the form; or by changing the order of the disclosures in the boxes, including the annual percentage rate and finance charge boxes.</p><p class="depth0">Using brackets, instead of checkboxes, to indicate inapplicable disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Using a line for the consumer to initial, rather than a checkbox, to indicate an election to receive an itemization of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">Deleting captions for disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Using a symbol, such as an asterisk, for estimated disclosures, instead of an ``e.''</p><p class="depth0">Adding a signature line to the insurance disclosures to reflect joint policies.</p><p class="depth0">Separately itemizing the filing fees.</p><p class="depth0">Revising the late charge disclosure in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 226.18(l).</p><p class="depth0">2. Model H-3. Creditors have considerable flexibility in filling out Model H-3 (itemization of the amount financed). Appropriate revisions, such as those set out in the commentary to Sec. 226.18(c), may be made to this form without loss of protection from civil liability for proper use of the model forms.</p><p class="depth0">3. Models H-4 through H-7. The model clauses are not included in the model forms although they are mandatory for certain transactions. Creditors using the model clauses when applicable to a transaction are deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to that disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">4. Model H-4(A). This model contains the variable rate model clauses applicable to transactions subject to Sec. 226.18(f)(1) and is intended to give creditors considerable flexibility in structuring variable rate disclosures to fit individual plans. The information about circumstances, limitations, and effects of an increase may be given in terms of the contract interest rate or the annual percentage rate. Clauses are shown for hypothetical examples based on the specific amount of the transaction and based on a representative amount. Creditors may preprint the variable rate disclosures based on a representative amount for similar types of transactions, instead of constructing an individualized example for each transaction. In both representative examples and transaction-specific examples, creditors may refer either to the incremental change in rate, payment amount, or number of payments, or to the resulting rate, payment amount, or number of payments. For example, creditors may state that the rate will increase by 2%, with a corresponding $150 increase in the payment, or creditors may state that the rate will increase to 16%, with a corresponding payment of $850.</p><p class="depth0">5. Model H-4(B). This model clause illustrates the variable-rate disclosure required under Sec. 226.18(f)(2), which would alert consumers to the fact that the transaction contains a variable-rate feature and that disclosures were provided earlier.</p><p class="depth0">6. Model H-4(C). This model clause illustrates the early disclosures required generally under Sec. 226.19(b). It includes information on how the consumer's interest rate is determined and how it can change over the term of the loan, and explains changes that

may occur in the borrower's monthly payment. It contains an example of how to disclose historical changes in the index or formula values used to compute interest rates for the preceding 15 years. The model clause also illustrates the disclosure of the initial and maximum interest rates and payments based on an initial interest rate (index value plus margin, adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure and illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating the monthly payment for the loan amount to be borrowed.</p><p class="depth0">7. Models H-4(D) through H-4(J). These model clauses illustrate certain notices, statements, and other disclosures required as follows</p><p class="depth0">i. Model H-4(D) illustrates the adjustment notice required under Sec. 226.20(c), and provides examples of payment change notices and annual notices of interest rate changes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Model H-4(E) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under Sec. 226.18(s) for a fixed-rate mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Model H-4(F) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under Sec. 226.18(s) for an adjustable-rate or a step-rate mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Model H-4(G) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under Sec. 226.18(s) for a mortgage transaction with negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">v. Model H-4(H) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary table required under Sec. 226.18(s) for a fixed-rate, interest-only mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Model H-4(I) illustrates the introductory rate disclosure required by Sec. 226.18(s)(2)(iii) for an adjustable-rate mortgage transaction with an introductory rate.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Model H-4(J) illustrates the balloon payment disclosure required by Sec. 226.18(s)(5) for a mortgage transaction with a balloon payment term.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Model H-4(K) illustrates the no-guarantee-to-refinance statement required by Sec. 226.18(t) for a mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">8. Model H-5. This contains the demand feature clause.</p><p class="depth0">9. Model H-6. This contains the assumption clause.</p><p class="depth0">10. Model H-7. This contains the required deposit clause.</p><p class="depth0">11. Models H-8 and H-9. These models contain the rescission notices for a typical closed-end transaction and a refinancing, respectively. The last paragraph of each model form contains a blank for the date by which the consumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the situation in which the consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the transaction, for example, where the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or where the date of the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the commentary to section 226.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest disclosure for model form H-9. The prior version of model form H-9 is substantially similar to the current version and creditors may continue to use it, as appropriate. Creditors are encouraged, however, to use the current version when reordering or reprinting forms.</p><p class="depth0">12. Sample forms. The sample forms (H-10 through H-15) serve a different purpose than the model forms. The samples illustrate various ways of adapting the model forms to the individual transactions described in the commentary to appendix H. The deletions and rearrangments shown relate only to the specific transactions described. As a result, the samples do not provide the general protection from civil liability provided by the model forms and clauses.</p><p class="depth0">13. Sample H-10. This sample illustrates an automobile credit sale. The cash price is $7,500 with a downpayment of $1,500. There is an 8% add-on interest rate and a term of 3 years, with 36 equal monthly payments. The credit life insurance premium and the filing fees are financed by the creditor. There is a $25 credit report fee paid by the consumer before consummation, which is a prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">14. Sample H-11. This sample illustrates an installment loan. The amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 12% simple interest rate and a term of 2 years. The date of the transaction is expected to be April 15, 1981, with the first payment due on June 1, 1981. The first payment amount is labelled as an estimate since the transaction date is uncertain. The odd days' interest ($26.67) is collected with the first payment. The remaining 23 monthly payments are equal.</p><p class="depth0">15. Sample H-12. This sample illustrates a refinancing and consolidation loan. The amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 15% simple interest rate and a term of 3 years. The date of the transaction is April 1, 1981, with the first payment due on May 1, 1981. The first 35 monthly payments are equal, with an odd final payment. The credit disability insurance premium is financed. In calculating the annual percentage rate, the U.S. Rule has been used. Since an itemization of the amount financed is included with the disclosures, the statement regarding the consumer's option to receive an itemization is deleted.</p><p class="depth0">16. Samples H-13 through H-15. These samples illustrate various mortgage transactions. They assume that the mortgages are

subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). As a result, no option regarding the itemization of the amount financed has been included in the samples, because providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA satisfies Truth in Lending's amount financed itemization requirement. (See footnote 39 to Sec. 226.18(c).)</p><p class="depth0">17. Sample H-13. This sample illustrates a mortgage with a demand feature. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. The 15 days of interim interest ($294.34) is collected as a prepaid finance charge at the time of consummation of the loan (April 15, 1981). In calculating the disclosure amounts, the minor irregularities provision in Sec. 226.17(c)(4) has been used. The property insurance premiums are not included in the payment schedule. This disclosure statement could be used for notes with the 7-year call option required by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in states where due-on-sale clauses are prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">18. Sample H-14. This sample disclosure form illustrates the disclosures under Sec. 226.19(b) for a variable-rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year. The sample form shows a creditor how to adapt the model clauses in appendix H-4(C) to the creditor's own particular variable-rate program. The sample disclosure form describes the features of a specific variable-rate mortgage program and alerts the consumer to the fact that information on the creditor's other closed-end variable-rate programs is available upon request. It includes information on how the interest rate is determined and how it can change over time. Section 226.19(b)(2)(viii) permits creditors the option to provide either a historical example or an initial and maximum interest rates and payments disclosure; both are illustrated in the sample disclosure. The historical example explains how the monthly payment can change based on a $10,000 loan amount, payable in 360 monthly installments, based on historical changes in the values for the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. Index values are measured for 15 years, as of the first week ending in July. This reflects the requirement that the index history be based on values for the same date or period each year in the example. The sample disclosure also illustrates the alternative disclosure under Sec. 226.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) that the initial and the maximum interest rates and payments be shown for a $10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent (which was in effect July 1996) and to have 2 percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or caps. Thus, the maximum amount that the interest rate could rise under this program is 5 percentage points higher than the 12.41 percent initial rate to 17.41 percent, and the monthly payment could rise from $106.03 to a maximum of $145.34. The loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until its fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the maximum payment disclosed reflects the amortization of the loan during that period. The sample form also illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating their actual monthly payment for a loan amount other than $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">19. Sample H-15. This sample illustrates a graduated payment mortgage with a 5-year graduation period and a 7\1/2\ percent yearly increase in payments. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. Two points ($898), as well as an initial mortgage guarantee insurance premium of $225.00, are included in the prepaid finance charge. The mortgage guarantee insurance premiums are calculated on the basis of \1/4\ of 1% of the outstanding principal balance under an annual reduction plan. The abbreviated disclosure permitted under Sec. 226.18(g)(2) is used for the payment schedule for years 6 through 30. The prepayment disclosure refers to both penalties and rebates because information about penalties is required for the simple interest portion of the obligation and information about rebates is required for the mortgage insurance portion of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">20. Sample H-16. This sample illustrates the disclosures required under Sec. 226.32(c). The sample illustrates the amount borrowed and the disclosures about optional insurance that are required for mortgage refinancings under Sec. 226.32(c)(5). Creditors may, at their option, include these disclosures for all loans subject to Sec. 226.32. The sample also includes disclosures required under Sec. 226.32(c)(3) when the legal obligation includes a balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">21. HRSA-500-1 9-82. Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, Form HRSA-500-1 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Subpart F.

Models H-18, H-19, H-20.</p><p class="depth0">i. These model forms illustrate disclosures required under Sec. 226.47 on or with an application or solicitation, at approval, and after acceptance of a private education loan. Although use of the model forms is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to private education loan disclosures. Creditors may make certain types of changes to private education loan model forms H-18 (application and solicitation), H-19 (approval), and H-20 (final) and still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. The model forms aggregate disclosures into groups under specific headings. Changes may not include rearranging the sequence of disclosures, for instance, by rearranging which disclosures are provided under each heading or by rearranging the sequence of the headings and grouping of disclosures. Changes to the model forms may not be so extensive as to affect the substance or clarity of the forms. Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection from civil liability.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor may delete inapplicable disclosures, such as:</p><p class="depth0">The Federal student financial assistance alternatives disclosures</p><p class="depth0">The self-certification disclosure</p><p class="depth0">Other permissible changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">Adding the creditor's address, telephone number, or Web site</p><p class="depth0">Adding loan identification information, such as a loan identification number</p><p class="depth0">Adding the date on which the form was printed or produced</p><p class="depth0">Placing the notice of the right to cancel in the top left or top right of the disclosure to accommodate a window envelope</p><p class="depth0">Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are the same.

Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in disclosing the Sec. Sec. 226.47(a), (b) and (c) disclosures, samples H-21, H-22, and H-23 are designed to be printed on two 8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheets of paper. A creditor may use a larger sheet of paper, such as 8\1/2\ x 14 inch sheets of paper, or may use multiple pages. If the disclosures are provided on two sides of a single sheet of paper, the creditor must include a reference or references, such as ``SEE BACK OF PAGE'' at the bottom of each page indicating that the disclosures continue onto the back of the page. If the disclosures are on two or more pages, a creditor may not include any intervening information between portions of the disclosure. In addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting the information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:</p><p class="depth0">A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Helvetica font style for body text).</p><p class="depth0">B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.</p><p class="depth0">C. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words, the body text was not compressed to appear smaller than the 10-point type size.</p><p class="depth0">D. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of the text.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background. Generally, black text was used on white paper.</p><p class="depth0">iii. While the Board is not requiring issuers to use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the disclosure, the Board encourages issuers to consider these techniques when deciding how to disclose information in the disclosure to ensure that the information is presented in a readable format.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic techniques in the disclosures, so long as the disclosures remain substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix H.</p><p class="depth0">26. Sample H-21. This sample illustrates a disclosure required under Sec. 226.47(a). The sample assumes a range of interest rates between 7.375% and 17.375%. The sample assumes a variable interest rate that will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The term of the sample loan is 20 years for an amount up to $20,000 and 30 years for an amount more than $20,000. The repayment options and sample costs have been combined into a single table, as permitted in the commentary to Sec. 226.47(a)(3). It demonstrates the loan amount, interest rate, and total paid when a consumer makes loan payments while in school, pays only interest while in school, and defers all payments while in school.</p><p class="depth0">27.

The sample demonstrates disclosure of an assumed maximum rate, and the statement that the consumer's actual maximum rate and payment amount could be higher. The payment schedule and terms assumes a 20-year loan term, the assumed maximum interest rate, and that the consumer elected to defer payments while enrolled in school.

While the formulas contained in this appendix may be directly applied to calculate the annual percentage rate for an individual transaction, they may also be utilized to program calculators and computers to perform the calculations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relation to Board tables. The Board's Annual Percentage Rate Tables also provide creditors with a calculation tool that applies the technical information in appendix J. An annual percentage rate computed in accordance with the instructions in the tables is deemed to comply with the regulation. Volume I of the tables may be used for credit transactions involving equal payment amounts and periods, as well as for transactions involving any of the following irregularities: odd first period, odd first payment and odd last payment. Volume II of the tables may be used for transactions that involve any type of irregularities. These tables may be obtained from any Federal Reserve Bank or from the Board in Washington, DC 20551, upon request.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">Statute: Section 107.</p><p class="depth0">Other sections: Section 226.22.</p><p class="depth0">Previous regulation: Section 226.40 (Supplement I).</p><p class="depth0">1981 changes: Paragraph (b)(2) has been revised to clarify that the term of the transaction never begins earlier than consummation of the transaction. Paragraph (b)(5)(vi) has been revised to permit creditors in single-advance, single-payment transactions in which the term is less than a year and is equal to a whole number of months, to use either the 12-month method or the 365-day method to compute the number of unit-periods per year.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix K--Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under appendix K is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or ``iteration'' procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under appendix J. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the regulation cross-references the procedures found in appendix J. In other aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of reverse mortgage transactions. Special definitions and instructions are included where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instructions and equations for the total annual loan cost rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(5)</em> Number of unit-periods between two given dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Number of unit-periods between two given dates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption as to when transaction begins. The computation of the total annual loan cost rate is based on the assumption that the

reverse mortgage transaction begins on the first day of the month in which consummation is estimated to occur. Therefore, fractional unit-periods (used under appendix J for calculating annual percentage rates) are not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(9)</em> Assumption for discretionary cash advances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Assumption for discretionary cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of credit. Creditors should compute the total annual loan cost rates for transactions involving discretionary cash advances by assuming that 50 percent of the initial amount of the credit available under the transaction is advanced at closing or, in an open-end transaction, when the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. (For the purposes of this assumption, the initial amount of the credit is the principal loan amount less any costs to the consumer under section 226.33(c)(1).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(10)</em> Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial discount or premium rate. Where a variable-rate reverse mortgage transaction includes an initial discount or premium rate, the creditor should apply the same rules for calculating the total annual loan cost rate as are applied when calculating the annual percentage rate for a loan with an initial discount or premium rate (see the commentary to Sec. 226.17(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reverse mortgage model form and sample form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)</em> Sample form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sample form.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for reverse mortgage disclosures does not require disclosures to be printed in any particular type size. Disclosures may be made on more than one page, and use both the front and the reverse sides, as long as the pages constitute an integrated document and the table disclosing the total annual loan cost rates is on a single page.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix L--Assumed Loan Periods for Computations of Total Annual Loan</p><p class="depth0">Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The life expectancy figures used in appendix L are those found in the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for women, as rounded to the nearest whole year and as published by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The figures contained in appendix L must be used by creditors for all consumers (men and women). Appendix L will be revised periodically by the Board to incorporate revisions to the figures made in the Decennial Tables.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix O--Illustrative Written Source Documents for Higher-Priced</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Loan Appraisal Rules</p><p class="depth0">1. Title commitment report. The ``title commitment report'' is a document from a title insurance company describing the property interest and status of its title, parties with interests in the title and the nature of their claims, issues with the title that must be resolved prior to closing of the transaction between the parties to the transfer, amount and disposition of the premiums, and endorsements on the title policy. This document is issued by the title insurance company prior to the company's issuance of an actual title insurance policy to the property's transferee and/or creditor financing the transaction. In different jurisdictions, this instrument may be referred to by different terms, such as a title commitment, title binder, title opinion, or title report.
