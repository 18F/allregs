Where the shell valve and the plastic pipe are in the same unmanned  space, the valve shall be operable from above the freeboard deck.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pipe that is to be used for potable water shall bear the seal of  approval or NSF mark of the National Sanitation Foundation Testing  Laboratory, Incorporated, School of Public Health, University of  Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose must be  in accordance with SAE J1942 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR  56.01-2) and may be installed only in vital and nonvital fresh and salt  water systems, nonvital pneumatic systems, lube oil and fuel systems,  and fluid power systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose may be used in vital fresh and salt  water systems at a maximum service pressure of 1,034 kPa (150 psi).  Nonmetallic flexible hose may be used in lengths not exceeding 76 cm (30  inches) where flexibility is required, subject to the limits in  paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. Nonmetallic flexible hose  may be used for plastic pipe in duplicate installations in accordance  with this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose may be used for plastic pipe in non- vital fresh and salt water systems and non-vital   pneumatic systems, subject to the limits of paragraphs (a)(1) through  (4) of this section. Unreinforced hoses are limited to a maximum service  pressure of 345 kPa (50 psi); reinforced hoses are limited to a maximum  service pressure of 1,034 kPa (150 psi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose may be used in lube oil, fuel oil and  fluid power systems only where flexibility is required and in lengths  not exceeding 30 inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nonmetallic flexible hose must be complete with factory- assembled end fittings requiring no further adjustment of the fittings  on the hose, except that field attachable type fittings may be used.  Hose end fittings must comply with SAE J1475 (incorporated by reference;  see 46 CFR 56.01-2). Field attachable fittings must be installed  following the manufacturer's recommended practice. If special equipment  is required, such as crimping machines, it must be of the type and  design specified by the manufacturer. A hydrostatic test of each hose  assembly must be conducted in accordance with Sec. 56.97-5 of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The fire-test procedures of ISO 15540 (incorporated by  reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2) are an acceptable alternative to those  procedures of SAE J1942.
