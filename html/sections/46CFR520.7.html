Carriers and conferences shall inform BTA, in writing, whenever a tariff is canceled and the effective date of that cancellation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicable rates. The rates, charges, and rules applicable to any given shipment shall be those in effect on the date the cargo is received by the common carrier or its agent including originating carriers in the case of rates for through transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimum quantity rates. When two or more TRIs are stated for the same commodity over the same route and under similar conditions, and the application is dependent upon the quantity of the commodity shipped, the total freight charges assessed against the shipment may not exceed the total charges computed for a larger quantity, if the TRI specifying a required minimum quantity (either weight or measurement; per container or in containers) will be applicable to the contents of the container(s), and if the minimum set forth is met or exceeded. At the shipper's option, a quantity less than the minimum level may be freighted at the lower TRI if the weight or measurement declared for rating purposes is increased to the minimum level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Green salted hides. The shipping weight for green salted hides shall be either a scale weight or a scale weight minus a deduction, which amount and method of computation are specified in the commodity description.

(1) New members of a conference shall cancel any independent tariffs applicable to the trades served by the conference, within ninety (90) days of membership in the conference. Individual conference members may publish their own separate open rate tariffs. Admission to the conference may be effective on the date notice is published in the conference tariff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New members of a conference shall cancel any independent tariffs applicable to the trades served by the conference, within ninety (90) days of membership in the conference. Individual conference members may publish their own separate open rate tariffs. Admission to the conference may be effective on the date notice is published in the conference tariff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New conference agreements have ninety (90) days within which to publish a new tariff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Overcharge claims. (1) No tariff may limit the filing of overcharge claims with a common carrier to a period of less than three (3) years from the accrual of the cause of action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No tariff may limit the filing of overcharge claims with a common carrier to a period of less than three (3) years from the accrual of the cause of action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The acceptance of any overcharge claim may not be conditioned upon the payment of a fee or charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No tariff may require that overcharge claims based on alleged errors in weight, measurement or description of cargo be filed before the cargo has left the custody of the common carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Returned cargo. When a carrier or conference offers the return shipment of refused, damaged or rejected shipments, or exhibits at trade fairs, shows or expositions, to port of origin at the TRI assessed on the original movement, and such TRI is lower than the prevailing TRI:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The return shipment must occur within one (1) year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The return movement must be made over the line of the same common carrier performing the original movement, except in the use of a conference tariff, where return may be made by any member line when the original shipment was carried under the conference tariff; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the original bill of lading showing the rate assessed must be presented to the return common carrier.
