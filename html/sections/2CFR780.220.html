                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the  OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier,  that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or  its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be  funded or provided by the USAID under a covered non-procurement  transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or  exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the USAID non-procurement  suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts  under covered non-procurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB  guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the  figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180).</p>
