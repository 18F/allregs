The State must submit the appeal in writing to the Regional Administrator and must include documentation that justifies the request for reconsideration. The appeal must specify the monetary figure in dispute and the provisions in Federal law, regulation, or policy with which the appellant believes the initial action was inconsistent. The applicant must appeal within 60 days of the applicant's receipt of our funding decision. The State must forward any appeal from an applicant or subgrantee

with a written recommendation to the Regional Administrator within 60 days of receipt. Within 90 days following the receipt of an appeal, the Regional Administrator will notify the State in writing as to the new decision or the need for more information.</p>
