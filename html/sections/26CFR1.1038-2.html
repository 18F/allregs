                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application of special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If paragraph (a)  of Sec. 1.1038-1 applies to the reacquisition of real property which  was used by the seller as his principal residence and with respect to  the sale of which an election under section 121 is in effect or with  respect to the sale of which gain was not recognized under section 1034,  the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-1 (other than paragraph (a) thereof)  shall not, and this section shall, apply to the reacquisition of such  property if the property is resold by the seller within one year after  the date of the reacquisition. For purposes of this section an election  under section 121 shall be considered to be in effect with respect to  the sale of the property if, at the close of the last day for making  such an election under section 121(c) with respect to such sale, an  election under section 121 has been made and not revoked. Thus, a  taxpayer who properly elects, subsequent to the reacquisition, to have  section 121 apply to a sale of his residence may be eligible for the  treatment provided in this section. The treatment provided by this  section is mandatory; however, see Sec. 1.1038-3 for an election to  apply the provisions of this section to certain taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sale and resale treated as one transaction. In the case of a  reacquisition to which this section applies, the resale of the  reacquired property shall be treated, for purposes of applying sections  121 and 1034, as part of the transaction constituting the original sale  of such property. In effect, the reacquisition is generally disregarded  pursuant to this section and, for purposes of applying sections 121 and  1034, the resale of the property is considered to constitute a sale of  such property occurring on the date of the original sale of such  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transactions not included. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If with respect to the original  sale of the property there was no nonrecognition of gain under section  1034 and an election under section 121 is not in effect, the provisions  of Sec. 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the  reacquisition. Thus, for example, if in the case of a taxpayer not  entitled to the benefit of section 121 there is no gain on the original  sale of the property, the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-1, and not this  section, shall apply even though a redetermination of gain under this  section would result in the nonrecognition of gain on the sale under  section 1034. Also, if in the case of such a taxpayer there was gain on  the original sale of the property but after the application of section  1034 all of such gain was recognized, the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-1,  and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the original sale of the property was not eligible for the  treatment provided by section 121 and section 1034, the provisions of  Sec. 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition  of the property even though the resale of such property is eligible for  the treatment provided by either or both of sections 121 and 1034.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Redetermination of gain required--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sale of old residence. The  amount of gain excluded under section 121 on the sale of the property  and the amount of gain recognized under section 1034 on the sale of the  property shall be redetermined under this section by recomputing the  adjusted sales price and the adjusted basis of the property, and any  adjustments resulting from the redetermination of the gain on the sale  of such property shall be reflected in the income of the seller for his  taxable year in which the resale of the property occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sale of new residence. If gain was not recognized under section  1034 on the original sale of the property, the adjusted basis of the new  residence shall be redetermined under this section. If the new residence  has been sold, the amount of gain returned on such sale of the new  residence which is affected by the redetermination of the recognized  gain on the sale of the old residence shall be redetermined under this  section, and any adjustments resulting from the redetermination of the  gain on the sale of the new residence shall be reflected in income of  the seller for his taxable year in which the resale of the old residence  occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Redetermination of adjusted sales price. For purposes of  applying sections 121 and 1034 pursuant to this section, the adjusted  sales price of the reacquired real property shall be redetermined by  taking into account both the sale and the resale of the property and  shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount realized, which for purposes of section 1001 shall  be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount realized on the resale of the property, as determined  under paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.1034-1, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount realized on the original sale of the property,  determined as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.1034-1, less that  portion of any obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to such  sale which at the time of reacquisition is secured by such property and  is unpaid, less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of money and the fair market value of other  property (other than obligations of the purchaser to the seller secured  by the real property) paid or transferred by the seller in connection  with the reacquisition of such real property,  reduced by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total of the fixing-up expenses (as defined in par. (b)(6)  of Sec. 1.1034-1) incurred for work performed on such real property to  assist in both its original sale and its resale.  For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(6) of Sec. 1.1034-1, there shall  be two 90-day periods, the first ending on the day on which the contract  to sell is entered into in connection with the original sale of the  property, and the second ending on the day on which the contract to sell  is entered into in connection with the resale of the property. There  shall also be two 30-day periods for such purposes, the first ending on  the 30th day after the date of the original sale, and the second ending  on the 30th day after the date of the resale. For determination of the  obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to the original sale  of the property, see paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.1038-1. For  determination of amounts paid or transferred by the seller in connection  with   the reacquisition of the property, see paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 1.1038- 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination of adjusted basis at time of resale. For purposes  of applying sections 121 and 1034 pursuant to this section, the adjusted  basis of the reacquired real property at the time of its resale shall  be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted basis of such property at the time of the original  sale, with proper adjustment under section 1016(a) in respect of such  property for the period occurring after the reacquisition of such  property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which arose  subsequent to the original sale of such property and which at the time  of reacquisition was secured by such property,  reduced by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which at the  time of reacquisition was secured by the reacquired real property and  which, for any taxable year ending before the taxable year in which  occurs the reacquisition to the seller which was secured by the seller  as having become worthless or partially worthless by taking a bad debt  deduction under section 166(a).  The reduction under the preceding sentence by reason of having treated  indebtedness as worthless or partially worthless shall not exceed the  amount by which there would be an increase in the basis of such  indebtedness under paragraph (f)(3) of Sec. 1.1038-1 if section 1038(d)  had been applicable to the reacquisition of such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of indebtedness secured by the property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Year of  reacquisition. No debt of the purchaser to the seller which was secured  by the reacquired real property shall be considered as becoming  worthless or partially worthless as a result of a reacquisition of such  real property to which this section applies. Accordingly, no deduction  for a bad debt shall be allowed, as a result of the reacquisition, in  order to reflect the noncollectibility of any indebtedness of the  purchaser to the seller which at the time of reacquisition was secured  by such real property. In addition, no deduction shall be allowed, for  the taxable year in which occurs a reacquisition of real property to  which this section applies, in respect of any indebtedness of the  purchaser secured by such property which has been treated by the seller  as having become worthless or partially worthless in such taxable year  but prior to the date of such reacquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior taxable years. For reduction of the basis of the real  property for indebtedness treated as worthless or partially worthless  for taxable years ending before the taxable year in which occurs the  reacquisition, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basis of indebtedness. The basis of any indebtedness of the  purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real  property, to the extent that such indebtedness is not discharged upon  the reacquisition of such property, shall be zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Date of sale. Since the resale of the property, by being treated  as part of the transaction constituting the original sale of the  property, is treated as having occurred on the date of the original  sale, in determining whether any of the time requirements of section 121  or section 1034 are satisfied for purposes of this section the date of  the original sale is used, except to the extent provided in paragraph  (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On June 30, 1964, S, a single individual over 65  years of age, sells his principal residence to P for $25,000, the  property not being mortgaged at the time of sale. S properly elects to  apply the provisions of section 121 to the sale. Under the contract, P  pays $5,000 down and executes a note for $20,000 with stated interest at  6 percent, the principal being payable in installments of $5,000 each on  January 1 of each year and the note being secured by the real property  which is sold. At the time of sale P's note has a fair market value of  $20,000. S does not elect to report the gain on the installment method  but treats the transaction as a deferred-payment sale, title to the  property being transferred to P at the time of sale. S uses the calendar  year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method  of accounting. After making two annual payments of $5,000 each on the  note, P defaults on the contract, and on March 1, 1967, S reacquires the  real property in full satisfaction of P's indebtedness, title to the  property being voluntarily reconveyed to S. On November 1, 1967, S sells  the property to T for $35,000. The assumption is made that no   fixing-up expenses are incurred for work performed on the principal  residence in order to assist in the sale of the property in 1964 or in  the resale of the property in 1967. At the time of sale in 1964 the  property has an adjusted basis of $15,000. S does not treat any  indebtedness with respect to the sale in 1964 as being worthless or  partially worthless or make any capital expenditures with respect to the  property after such sale. In his return for 1964, S includes in income  $2,000 capital gain from the sale of his residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The results obtained before and after the reacquisition of the  property are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Before         After</p><p class="depth0">reacquisition  reacquisition ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Adjusted sales price:</p><p class="depth0">$5,000+$20,000..........................      $25,000    .............</p><p class="depth0">$15,000+$35,000.........................  .............      $50,000 Less: Adjusted basis of property at time         15,000         15,000</p><p class="depth0">of sale..................................</p><p class="depth0">----------------------------- Gain on sale..............................       10,000         35,000</p><p class="depth0">============================= Gain excluded from income under section</p><p class="depth0">121:.....................................</p><p class="depth0">$10,000x$20,000/$25,000.................        8,000    .............</p><p class="depth0">$35,000x$20,000/$50,000.................  .............       14,000 Gain included in income after applying</p><p class="depth0">section 121:</p><p class="depth0">$10,000-$8,000..........................        2,000    .............</p><p class="depth0">$35,000-$14,000.........................  .............       21,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> S is required to show the additional inclusion of $19,000  capital gain ($21,000 -$2,000) in income on his return for 1967.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in example (1) except that  on April 1, 1965, S purchases a new residence at a cost of $30,000 and  qualifies for the nonrecognition of gain under section 1034 in respect  of the sale of his principal residence on June 30, 1964.

The facts are the same as in example (2) except that S  sells the new residence on June 20, 1965, for $40,000 and includes  $12,000 of capital gain ($40,000- $28,000) on its sale in his income on  the return for 1965. S is required to include the additional capital  gain of $13,000 ([$40,000- $15,000]-$12,000) on the sale of the new  residence in his income on the return for 1967. For this purpose, the  assumption is also made that there are no additional adjustments to the  basis of the new residence after April 1, 1965.
