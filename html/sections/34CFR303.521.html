The following are required functions that must be carried out at public expense, and for which no fees may be charged to parents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Implementing the child find requirements in Secs. 303.301 through 303.303.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation and assessment, in accordance with Sec. 303.320, and the functions related to evaluation and assessment in Sec. 303.13(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service coordination services, as defined in Secs. 303.13(b)(11) and 303.33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative and coordinative activities related to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The development, review, and evaluation of IFSPs and interim IFSPs in accordance with Secs. 303.342 through 303.345; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Implementation of the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part and the other components of the statewide system of early intervention services in subpart D of this part and this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> States with FAPE mandates, or that use funds under Part B of the Act to serve children under age three. If a State has in effect a State law requiring the provision of FAPE for, or uses part B funds to serve, an infant or toddler with a disability under the age of three (or any subset of infants and toddlers with disabilities under the age of three), the State may not charge the parents of the infant or toddler with a disability for any services (e.g., physical or occupational therapy) under this part that are part of FAPE for that infant or toddler and the child's family, and those FAPE services must meet the requirements of both parts B and C of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Family fees. (1) Fees or costs collected from a parent or the child's family to pay for early intervention services under a State's system of payments are program income under 2 CFR 200.307.

Any fees collected must be used for the purposes of the grant under part C of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fees or costs collected from a parent or the child's family to pay for early intervention services under a State's system of payments are program income under 2 CFR 200.307.
