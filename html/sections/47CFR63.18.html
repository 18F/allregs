                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this part, any party seeking authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to construct a new line, or acquire or operate any line, or engage in transmission over or by means of such additional line for the provision of common carrier communications services between the United States, its territories or possessions, and a foreign point shall request such authority by formal application. The application shall include information demonstrating how the grant of the application will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Such demonstration shall consist of the following information, as applicable:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of each applicant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Government, State, or Territory under the laws of which each corporate or partnership applicant is organized;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The name, title, post office address, and telephone number of the officer and any other contact point, such as legal counsel, to whom correspondence concerning the application is to be addressed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A statement as to whether the applicant has previously received authority under Section 214 of the Act and, if so, a general description of the categories of facilities and services authorized (i.e., authorized to provide international switched services on a facilities basis);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> One or more of the following statements, as pertinent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Global facilities-based authority. If applying for authority to become a facilities-based international common carrier subject to Sec. 63.22 of this part, the applicant shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State that it is requesting Section 214 authority to operate as a facilities-based carrier pursuant to Sec. 63.18(e)(1) of this part of the Commission's rules;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List any countries for which the applicant does not request authorization under this paragraph (see Sec. 63.22(a) of this part); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Certify that it will comply with the terms and conditions contained in Sec. Sec. 63.21 and 63.22 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Global Resale Authority. If applying for authority to resell the international services of authorized common carriers subject to Sec. 63.23, the applicant shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State that it is requesting Section 214 authority to operate as a resale carrier pursuant to Sec. 63.18(e)(2) of this section of the Commission's rules;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List any countries for which the applicant does not request authorization under this paragraph (see Sec. 63.23(a) of this part); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Certify that it will comply with the terms and conditions contained in Sec. Sec. 63.21 and 63.23 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other authorizations. If applying for authority to acquire facilities or to provide services not covered by paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, the applicant shall provide a description of the facilities and services for which it seeks authorization. The applicant shall certify that it will comply with the terms and conditions contained in Sec. Sec. 63.21 and 63.22 and/or 63.23, as appropriate. Such description also shall include any additional information the Commission shall have specified previously in an order, public notice or other official action as necessary for authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicants may apply for any or all of the authority provided for in paragraph (e) of this section in the same application. The applicant may want to file separate applications for those services not subject to streamlined processing under Sec. 63.12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Where the applicant is seeking facilities-based authority under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a statement whether an authorization of the facilities is categorically excluded as defined by Sec. 1.1306 of this chapter. If answered affirmatively, an environmental assessment as described in Sec. 1.1311 of this chapter need not be filed with the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The name, address, citizenship and principal businesses of any person or entity that directly or indirectly owns at least ten percent of the equity of the applicant, and the percentage of equity owned by each of those entities (to the nearest one percent). The applicant shall also identify any interlocking directorates with a foreign carrier.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (h): Ownership and other interests in U.S. and foreign carriers will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following criteria: Attribution of ownership interests in a carrier that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain that is equal to or exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. For example, if A owns 30 percent of company X, which owns 60 percent of company Y, which owns 26 percent of ``carrier,'' then X's interest in ``carrier'' would be 26 percent (the same as Y's interest because X's interest in Y exceeds 50 percent), and A's interest in ``carrier'' would be 7.8 percent (0.30 x 0.26 because A's interest in X is less than 50 percent). Under the 25 percent attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``carrier'' would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A certification as to whether or not the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier. The certification shall state with specificity each foreign country in which the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A certification as to whether or not the applicant seeks to provide international telecommunications services to any destination country for which any of the following is true. The certification shall state with specificity the foreign carriers and destination countries:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant is a foreign carrier in that country; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant controls a foreign carrier in that country; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any entity that owns more than 25 percent of the applicant, or that controls the applicant, controls a foreign carrier in that country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Two or more foreign carriers (or parties that control foreign carriers) own, in the aggregate, more than 25 percent of the applicant and are parties to, or the beneficiaries of, a contractual relation (e.g., a joint venture or market alliance) affecting the provision or marketing of international basic telecommunications services in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> For any country that the applicant has listed in response to paragraph (j) of this section that is not a member of the World Trade Organization, the applicant shall make a demonstration as to whether the foreign carrier has market power, or lacks market power, with reference to the criteria in Sec. 63.10(a).</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (k): Under Sec. 63.10(a), the Commission presumes, subject to rebuttal, that a foreign carrier lacks market power in a particular foreign country if the applicant demonstrates that the foreign carrier lacks 50 percent market share in international transport facilities or services, including cable landing station access and

backhaul facilities, intercity facilities or services, and local access facilities or services on the foreign end of a particular route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> With respect to regulatory classification under Sec. 63.10 of this part, any applicant that is or is affiliated with a foreign carrier in a country listed in response to paragraph (i) of this section and that desires to be regulated as non-dominant for the provision of particular international telecommunications services to that country should provide information in its application to demonstrate that it qualifies for non-dominant classification pursuant to Sec. 63.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A certification that the applicant has not agreed to accept special concessions directly or indirectly from any foreign carrier with respect to any U.S. international route where the foreign carrier possesses market power on the foreign end of the route and will not enter into such agreements in the future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> A certification pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1.2001 through 1.2003 of this chapter that no party to the application is subject to a denial of Federal benefits pursuant to Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. See 21 U.S.C. 853a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> If the applicant desires streamlined processing pursuant to Sec. 63.12, a statement of how the application qualifies for streamlined processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Any other information that may be necessary to enable the Commission to act on the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Subject to the availability of electronic forms, all applications described in this section must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS). A list of forms that are available for electronic filing can be found on the IBFS homepage. For information on electronic filing requirements, see part 1, Sec.
