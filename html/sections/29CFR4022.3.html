                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the PBGC  will guarantee the amount, as of the termination date, of a benefit  provided under a plan to the extent that the benefit does not exceed the  limitations in ERISA and in subpart B, if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The benefit is, on the termination date, a nonforfeitable  benefit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The benefit qualifies as a pension benefit as defined in  Sec. 4022.2; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The participant is entitled to the benefit under Sec. 4022.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substitution of bankruptcy  filing date. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, ``bankruptcy filing  date'' is substituted for ``termination date'' each place that  ``termination date'' appears in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Condition for entitlement satisfied between bankruptcy filing  date and termination date. If a participant becomes entitled to a  subsidized early retirement or other benefit before the termination date  (or on or before the termination date, in the case of a requirement that  a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of  service, become disabled, or die) but on or after the bankruptcy filing  date (or after the bankruptcy filing date, in the case of a requirement  that a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of  service, become disabled, or die), the subsidy or other benefit is not  guaranteed because the participant had not satisfied the conditions for  entitlement by the bankruptcy filing date. In such a case, the  participant may have been put into pay status with the subsidized early  retirement or other benefit by the plan administrator, because the plan  was ongoing at the time. Even though the subsidy or other benefit is not  guaranteed, the participant may be entitled to another benefit from PBGC  (at that time or in the future). If so, PBGC will continue paying the  participant a benefit, but in an amount reduced to reflect that the  subsidy or other benefit is not guaranteed. PBGC will also allow a  similarly situated participant who had not started receiving a  subsidized early retirement or other benefit before PBGC became trustee  of the plan to begin receiving a benefit (if the participant would have  been allowed under the plan to begin receiving benefits and has reached  his Earliest PBGC Retirement Date, as defined in Sec. 4022.10), but in  an amount that does not include the subsidy or other benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vesting. A plan provides for 5-year ``cliff''  vesting--i.e., benefits become 100% vested when the participant  completes five years of service; before the five-year mark, benefits are  0% vested. The contributing sponsor of the plan files a bankruptcy  petition on November 15, 2006. The plan terminates with a termination  date of December 4, 2007, and PBGC becomes statutory trustee of the  plan. A participant had four years and six months of service at the  bankruptcy filing date and became vested in May 2007. None of the  participant's benefit is guaranteed because none of the benefit was  nonforfeitable as of the bankruptcy filing date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsidized early retirement benefit. The facts regarding the  plan are the same as in Example (i) (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section), but the plan also provides that a participant may retire from  active employment at any age with a fully subsidized (i.e., not  actuarially reduced) early retirement benefit if he has completed 30  years of service. The plan also provides that a participant who is age  60 and has completed 20 years of service may retire from active  employment with an early retirement benefit, reduced by three   percent for each year by which the participant's age at benefit  commencement is less than 65. A participant was age 61 and had 29 years  and 6 months of service at the bankruptcy filing date. The participant  continued working for another six months, then retired as of June 1,  2007, and immediately began receiving from the plan the fully subsidized  ``30-and-out'' early retirement benefit. PBGC will continue paying the  participant a benefit, but PBGC's guarantee does not include the full  subsidy for the ``30-and-out'' benefit, because the participant  satisfied the conditions for that benefit after the bankruptcy filing  date. The guarantee does include, however, the partial subsidy  associated with the ``60/20'' early retirement benefit, because the  participant satisfied the conditions for that benefit before the  bankruptcy filing date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accruals after bankruptcy filing date. The facts regarding the  plan are the same as in Example (i) (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section). A participant has a vested, accrued benefit of $500 per month  as of the bankruptcy filing date. At the plan's termination date, the  participant has a vested, accrued benefit of $512 per month. His  guaranteed benefit is limited to $500 per month--the accrued,  nonforfeitable benefit as of the bankruptcy filing date.
