                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Commercial information provided to the Commission shall not be disclosed except in accordance with this section. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Confidential commercial information refers to records provided by a submitter containing information that is arguably exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure

could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter refers to any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the government. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, State governments, and foreign governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to submitter. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the Commission shall provide a submitter with explicit notice of a FOIA request for confidential commercial records whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission reasonably believes that disclosure could cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information was submitted after January 1, 1988, and the submitter previously, in good faith, designated the records as confidential commercial information. Such designations shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whenever possible, include a statement or certification from an officer or authorized representative of the company that the information is in fact confidential commercial information and has not been disclosed to the public; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Expire ten years from the date of submission unless otherwise justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice to requester. When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the requester shall be notified that notice and opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Opportunity of submitter to object. When notification is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission shall afford the submitter a minimum of five business days to provide it with a detailed statement of objections to disclosure. Such statement shall provide precise identification of the exempted information, and the basis for claiming it as a trade secret or as confidential information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), the disclosure of which is likely to cause substantial harm to the submitter's competitive position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. (1) The Commission shall consider carefully the objections of a submitter provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. When the Commission decides to disclose information despite such objections, it shall provide the submitter with a written statement briefly explaining why the objections were not sustained. Such statement shall be provided a minimum of three business days prior to the specified disclosure date, in order that the submitter may seek a court injunction to prevent release of the records if it so chooses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission shall consider carefully the objections of a submitter provided pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. When the Commission decides to disclose information despite such objections, it shall provide the submitter with a written statement briefly explaining why the objections were not sustained. Such statement shall be provided a minimum of three business days prior to the specified disclosure date, in order that the submitter may seek a court injunction to prevent release of the records if it so chooses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a submitter is notified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, notice of the Commission's final disclosure determination and proposed release date shall also be provided to the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Commission shall promptly notify the submitter of the legal action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exceptions to the notice requirement. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission determines that the information shall not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information is published or otherwise officially available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).
