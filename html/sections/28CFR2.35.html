                                Sec.  2.35  Mandatory release in the absence of parole.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A prisoner shall be mandatorily released by operation of law at  the end of the sentence imposed by the court less such good time  deductions as he may have earned through his behavior and efforts at the  institution of confinement. If released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4164, such  prisoner shall be released, as if on parole, under supervision until the  expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less  180 days. If released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(f), such prisoner shall  remain under supervision until the expiration of the maximum term or  terms for which he was sentenced. Insofar as possible, release plans  shall be completed before the release of any such prisoner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the Commission's interpretation of the statutory scheme  for parole and good time that the only function of good time credits is  to determine the point in a prisoner's sentence when, in the absence of  parole, the prisoner is to be conditionally released on supervision, as  described in subsection (a). Once an offender is conditionally released  from imprisonment, either by parole or mandatory release, the good time  earned during that period of imprisonment is of no further effect either  to shorten the period of supervision or to shorten the period of  imprisonment which the offender may be required to serve for violation  of parole or mandatory release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A prisoner committed under the Youth Corrections Act must be  initially released conditionally under supervision not later than two  years before the expiration of the term imposed by the court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Commission orders a military prisoner who is under the  Commission's jurisdiction for an offense committed after August 15, 2001  continued to the expiration of his sentence (or otherwise does not grant  parole), the Commission shall place such prisoner on mandatory  supervision after release if the Commission determines that such  supervision is appropriate to provide an orderly transition to civilian  life for the prisoner and to protect the community into which such  prisoner is released. The Commission shall presume that mandatory  supervision is appropriate for all such prisoners unless case-specific  factors indicate that supervision is inappropriate. A prisoner who is  placed on mandatory supervision shall be deemed to be released as if on  parole, and shall be subject to the conditions of release at Sec.  2.40  until the expiration of the maximum term for which he was sentenced,  unless the prisoner's sentence is terminated early by the appropriate  military clemency board.
