This section does not apply to agencies and positions that are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (44 U.S.C. 2201-2207) (see 36 CFR part 1270 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personal files must be clearly designated as such and must be maintained separately from the office's official records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information about private (non-agency) matters and agency business must not be mixed in outgoing agency documents, such as correspondence and messages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If information about private matters and agency business appears in a received document, the document is a Federal record. Agencies may make a copy of the document with the personal information deleted or redacted, and treat the copy as the Federal record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Materials labeled ``personal,'' ``confidential,'' or ``private,'' or similarly designated, and used in the transaction of public business, are Federal records. The use of a label such as ``personal'' does not affect the status of documentary materials in a Federal agency.</p>
