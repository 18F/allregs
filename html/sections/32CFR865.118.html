                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A copy of the decisional document prepared in accordance with  Sec. 865.114 of this subpart, shall be made available for public  inspection and copying promptly after a notice of final decision is sent  to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion  of personal privacy, identifying details of the applicant and other  persons will be deleted from documents made available for public  inspection and copying. Names, addresses, social security numbers, and  military service numbers must be deleted. Written justification shall be  made for all other deletions and shall be available for public  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The DRB shall ensure that there is a means for relating a  decisional document number to the name of the applicant to permit  retrieval of the applicant's records when required in processing a  complaint in accordance with Sec. 865.121 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any other privileged or classified material contained in or  appended to any documents required to be furnished the applicant and  counsel/representative or made available for public inspection and  copying may be deleted therefrom only if a written statement of the  basis for the deletions is provided the applicant and counsel/ representative and made available for public inspection. It is not  intended that the statement be so detailed as to reveal the nature of  the withheld material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DRB documents made available for public inspection and copying  shall be located in the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Boards  Reading Room. The documents shall be indexed in usable and concise form  so as to enable the public and those who represent applicants before the  DRB to isolate from all these decisions that are indexed those cases  that may be similar to an applicant's case and that indicate the  circumstances under and/or reasons for which the DRB or the Secretary of  the Air Force granted or denied relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reading file index shall include, in addition to any other  items determined by the DRB, the case number, the date, character of,  reason for, and authority for the discharge. It shall further include  the decisions of the DRB and reviewing authority, if any, and the issues  addressed in the statement of findings, conclusions and reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The index shall be maintained at selected permanent locations  throughout the United States. This ensures reasonable availability to  applicants at least 30 days before a regional board review. The index  shall also be made   available at sites selected for regional Boards for such periods as the  DRB is present and in operation. An applicant who has requested a  regional board review shall be advised in the notice of scheduled  hearings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading Room  shall publish indexes quarterly for the DRB. The DRB shall be  responsible for timely submission to the Reading Room of individual case  information required for update of indexes. These indexes shall be  available for public inspection or purchase (or both) at the Reading  Room. This information will be provided to applicants in the notice of  acceptance of the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Correspondence relating to matters under the cognizance of the  Reading Room (including request for purchase of indexes) shall be  addressed to:  DA Military Review Board Agency, Attention: SFBA (Reading Room), Room  1E520, The Pentagon, Washington DC 20310</p>
