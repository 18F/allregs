                            <p class="depth0">This subpart provides a framework for a new management system for wastes that are generated in University laboratories. This framework is called the Laboratory Environmental Management Standard. The standard includes some specific definitions that apply to the University laboratories. It contains specific requirements for how to handle laboratory waste that are called Minimum Performance Criteria. The standard identifies the requirements for developing and implementing an environmental management plan. It outlines the responsibilities of the management staff of each participating university. Finally, the standard identifies requirements for training people who will work in the laboratories or manage laboratory waste. This Subpart contains requirements for RCRA solid and hazardous waste determination, and circumstances for termination and expiration of this pilot.</p>
