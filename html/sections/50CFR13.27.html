                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for suspension. The privileges of exercising some or  all of the permit authority may be suspended at any time if the  permittee is not in compliance with the conditions of the permit, or  with any applicable laws or regulations governing the conduct of the  permitted activity. The issuing officer may also suspend all or part of  the privileges authorized by a permit if the permittee fails to pay any  fees, penalties or costs owed to the Government. Such suspension shall  remain in effect until the issuing officer determines that the permittee  has corrected the deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for suspension. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the issuing officer believes  there are valid grounds for suspending a permit the permittee shall be  notified in writing of the proposed suspension by certified or  registered mail. This notice shall identify the permit to be suspended,  the reason(s) for such suspension, the actions necessary to correct the  deficiencies, and inform the permittee of the right to object to the  proposed suspension. The issuing officer may amend any notice of  suspension at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of a notice of proposed suspension the permittee  may file a written objection to the proposed action. Such objection must  be in writing, must be filed within 45 calendar days of the date of the  notice of proposal, must state the reasons why the permittee objects to  the proposed suspension, and may include supporting documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A decision on the suspension shall be made within 45 days after  the end of the objection period. The issuing officer shall notify the  permittee in writing of the Service's decision and the reasons  therefore. The issuing officer shall also provide the applicant with the  information concerning the right to request reconsideration of the  decision under Sec.  13.29 of this part and the procedures for  requesting reconsideration.
