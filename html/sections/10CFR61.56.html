                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following requirements are minimum requirements for all  classes of waste and are intended to facilitate handling at the disposal  site and provide protection of health and safety of personnel at the  disposal site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waste must not be packaged for disposal in cardboard or  fiberboard boxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Liquid waste must be solidified or packaged in sufficient  absorbent material to absorb twice the volume of the liquid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Solid waste containing liquid shall contain as little free  standing and noncorrosive liquid as is reasonably achievable, but in no  case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Waste must not be readily capable of detonation or of explosive  decomposition or reaction at normal pressures and temperatures, or of  explosive reaction with water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Waste must not contain, or be capable of generating, quantities  of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes harmful to persons transporting,  handling, or disposing of the waste. This does not apply to radioactive  gaseous waste packaged in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Waste must not be pyrophoric. Pyrophoric materials contained in  waste shall be treated, prepared, and packaged to be nonflammable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Waste in a gaseous form must be packaged at a pressure that does  not exceed 1.5 atmospheres at 20 [deg]C. Total activity must not exceed  100 curies per container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Waste containing hazardous, biological, pathogenic, or  infectious material must be treated to reduce to the maximum extent  practicable the potential hazard from the non-radiological materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements in this section are intended to provide  stability of the waste. Stability is intended to ensure that the waste  does not structurally degrade and affect overall stability of the site  through slumping, collapse, or other failure of the disposal unit and  thereby lead to water infiltration. Stability is also a factor in  limiting exposure to an inadvertent intruder, since it provides a  recognizable and nondispersible waste.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waste must have structural stability. A structurally stable  waste form will generally maintain its physical dimensions and its form,  under the expected disposal conditions such as weight of overburden and  compaction equipment, the presence of moisture, and microbial activity,  and internal factors such as radiation effects and chemical changes.  Structural stability can be provided by the waste form itself,  processing the waste to a stable form, or placing the waste in a  disposal container or structure that provides stability after disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3),  liquid wastes, or wastes containing liquid, must be converted into a  form that contains as little free standing and noncorrosive liquid as is  reasonably achievable, but in no case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the  volume of the waste when the waste is in a disposal container designed  to ensure stability, or 0.5% of the volume of the waste for waste  processed to a stable form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Void spaces within the waste and between the waste and its  package must be reduced to the extent practicable.</p>
