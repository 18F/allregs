                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recordkeeping. Each State agency will make and maintain records pertaining to the administration of the Act as the Secretary requires and will make all such records available for inspection, examination and audit by such Federal officials as the Secretary may designate or as may be required by law. Such recordkeeping will be adequate to support the reporting of TAA activity on reporting form ETA 563 approved under OMB control number 1205-0016.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure of information. Information in records maintained by a State agency in administering the Act shall be kept confidential, and information in such records may be disclosed only in the same manner and to the same extent as information with respect to UI and the entitlement of individuals thereto may be disclosed under the applicable State law. Such information shall not, however, be disclosed to an employer or any other person except to the extent necessary to obtain information from the employer or other person for the purposes of this part 617. This provision on the confidentiality of information maintained in the administration of the Act shall not apply, however, to the Department or for the purposes of Sec. 617.55 or paragraph (a) of this section, or in the case of information, reports and studies required pursuant to Sec. 617.61, or where the result would be inconsistent with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or regulations of the Department promulgated thereunder (see 29 CFR parts 70 and 70a).</p>
