                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart--</p><p class="depth0">Active corrosion means continuing corrosion which, unless controlled, could result in a condition that is detrimental to public safety or the environment.</p><p class="depth0">Buried means covered or in contact with soil.</p><p class="depth0">Direct assessment means an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e., external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a pipeline segment's integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and post assessment evaluation.</p><p class="depth0">Electrical survey means a series of closely spaced pipe-to-soil readings over a pipeline that are subsequently analyzed to identify locations where a corrosive current is leaving the pipeline.</p><p class="depth0">External corrosion direct assessment (ECDA) means a four-step process that combines pre-assessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post-assessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity of a pipeline.</p><p class="depth0">Pipeline environment includes soil resistivity (high or low), soil moisture (wet or dry), soil contaminants that may promote corrosive activity, and other known conditions that could affect the probability of active corrosion.</p><p class="depth0">You means operator.
