                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon request, the Census Bureau certifies certain statistical  materials (such as the population and housing unit counts of government  entities,   published tabulations, maps, and other documents). The Census Bureau  charges customers a preset fee for this service according to the kind of  certification requested (either an impressed document or an attestation)  and the level of difficulty involved in compiling it (easy, moderate, or  difficult, determined according to the resources expended) as well as  the set cost of the data product (e.g., report or map) to be certified.  Certification prices are shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth2">Price by Type of Certification ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Estimated</p><p class="depth2">Estimated    time to</p><p class="depth2">Product                         price     complete</p><p class="depth2">(in hours) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Impress-easy.....................................     $70.00         1.5 Impress-medium...................................     110.00         3 Impress-difficult................................     150.00         4.5 Attestation-easy.................................     160.00         3 Attestation-medium...............................     200.00         4.5 Attestation-difficult............................     240.00         6 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There are two forms of certification available: Impressed  Documents and Attestation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Impressed documents. An impressed document is one that is  certified by impressing the Census Bureau seal on the document itself.  The Census Bureau act, Title 13, United States Code, Section 3, provides  that the seal of the Census Bureau shall be affixed to all documents  authenticated by the Census Bureau and that judicial notice shall be  taken of the seal. This process attests that the document on which the  seal is impressed is a true and accurate copy of a Census Bureau record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attestation. Attestation is a more formal process of  certification. It consists of a signed statement by a Census Bureau  official that the document is authentic and produced or published by the  agency, followed by a signed statement of another Census Bureau official  witnessing the authority of the first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for certification should be submitted on Form BC- 1868(EF), Request for Official Certification, to the Census Bureau by  fax, (301) 457-4714 or by e-mail, webmaster@census.gov. Form BC-1868(EF)  is available on the Census Bureau's Web site at: http://www.census.gov/ mso/www/certification/. A letter request--without Form BC-1868(EF)--will  be accepted only if it contains the information necessary to complete a  Form BC-1868(EF). No certification request will be processed without  payment of the required fee.  [67 FR 54951, Aug. 27, 2002]</p>
