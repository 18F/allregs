For the avoidance of doubt, value given to a copyright owner of musical works that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a record company for rights to undertake the licensed activity shall not be considered

value given to the record company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicable consideration shall not include in-kind promotional consideration given to a record company (or affiliate thereof) that is used to promote the sale or paid use of sound recordings embodying musical works or the paid use of music services through which sound recordings embodying musical works are available where such in-kind promotional consideration is given in connection with a use that qualifies for licensing under 17 U.S.C. 115.</p><p class="depth0">GAAP means U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, except that if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permits or requires entities with securities that are publicly traded in the U.S. to employ International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or as accepted by the Securities and Exchange Commission if different from that issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, in lieu of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, then an entity may employ International Financial Reporting Standards as ``GAAP'' for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Interactive stream means a stream of a sound recording of a musical work, where the performance of the sound recording by means of the stream is not exempt under 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1) and does not in itself or as a result of a program in which it is included qualify for statutory licensing under 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Licensee means a person that has obtained a compulsory license under 17 U.S.C. 115 and its implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Licensed activity means interactive streams or limited downloads of musical works, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Limited download means a digital transmission of a sound recording of a musical work to an end user, other than a stream, that results in a specifically identifiable reproduction of that sound recording that is only accessible for listening for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An amount of time not to exceed 1 month from the time of the transmission (unless the service provider, in lieu of retransmitting the same sound recording as another limited download, separately and upon specific request of the end user made through a live network connection, reauthorizes use for another time period not to exceed 1 month), or in the case of a subscription transmission, a period of time following the end of the applicable subscription no longer than a subscription renewal period or 3 months, whichever is shorter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A specified number of times not to exceed 12 (unless the service provider, in lieu of retransmitting the same sound recording as another limited download, separately and upon specific request of the end user made through a live network connection, reauthorizes use of another series of 12 or fewer plays), or in the case of a subscription transmission, 12 times after the end of the applicable subscription.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A limited download is a general digital phonorecord delivery under 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(C) and (D).</p><p class="depth0">Offering means a service provider's offering of licensed activity that is subject to a particular rate set forth in Sec.  385.13(a) (e.g., a particular subscription plan available through the service provider).</p><p class="depth0">Promotional royalty rate means the statutory royalty rate of zero in the case of certain promotional interactive streams and certain promotional limited downloads, as provided in Sec.  385.14.</p><p class="depth0">Record company means a person or entity that</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is a copyright owner of a sound recording of a musical work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a sound recording of a musical work fixed before February 15, 1972, has rights to the sound recording, under the common law or statutes of any State, that are equivalent to the rights of a copyright owner of a sound recording of a musical work under title 17, United States Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is an exclusive licensee of the rights to reproduce and distribute a sound recording of a musical work; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Performs the functions of marketing and authorizing the distribution of a sound recording of a musical work under its own label, under the authority of the copyright owner of the sound recording.</p><p class="depth0">Relevant page means a page (including a Web page, screen or display) from which licensed activity offered by a

service provider is directly available to end users, but only where the offering of licensed activity and content that directly relates to the offering of licensed activity (e.g., an image of the artist or artwork closely associated with such offering, artist or album information, reviews of such offering, credits and music player controls) comprises 75% or more of the space on that page, excluding any space occupied by advertising. A licensed activity is directly available to end users from a page if sound recordings of musical works can be accessed by end users for licensed activity from such page (in most cases this will be the page where the limited download or interactive stream takes place).</p><p class="depth0">Service provider means that entity (which may or may not be the licensee) that, with respect to the licensed activity,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contracts with or has a direct relationship with end users in a case where a contract or relationship exists, or otherwise controls the content made available to end users;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is able to report fully on service revenue from the provision of the licensed activity to the public, and to the extent applicable, verify service revenue through an audit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is able to report fully on usage of musical works by the service, or procure such reporting, and to the extent applicable, verify usage through an audit.</p><p class="depth0">Service revenue.

By way of example, the following kinds of revenue shall be excluded:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revenue derived from non-music voice, content and text services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revenue derived from other non-music products and services (including search services, sponsored searches and click-through commissions); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Revenue derived from music or music-related products and services

that are not or do not include licensed activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of paragraph (1) of the definition of ``Service revenue,'' advertising or sponsorship revenue shall be reduced by the actual cost of obtaining such revenue, not to exceed 15%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the licensed activity is provided to end users as part of the same transaction with one or more other products or services that are not a music service engaged in licensed activity, then the revenue deemed to be recognized from end users for the service for the purpose of the definition in paragraph (1) of the definition of ``Service revenue'' shall be the revenue recognized from end users for the bundle less the standalone published price for end users for each of the other component(s) of the bundle; provided that, if there is no such standalone published price for a component of the bundle, then the average standalone published price for end users for the most closely comparable product or service in the U.S. shall be used or, if more than one such comparable exists, the average of such standalone prices for such comparables shall be used.</p><p class="depth0">Stream means the digital transmission of a sound recording of a musical work to an end user--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To allow the end user to listen to the sound recording, while maintaining a live network connection to the transmitting service, substantially at the time of transmission, except to the extent that the sound recording remains accessible for future listening from a streaming cache reproduction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Using technology that is designed such that the sound recording does not remain accessible for future listening, except to the extent that the sound recording remains accessible for future listening from a streaming cache reproduction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That is also subject to licensing as a public performance of the musical work.</p><p class="depth0">Streaming cache reproduction means a reproduction of a sound recording of a musical work made on a computer or other receiving device by a service solely for the purpose of permitting an end user who has previously received a stream of such sound recording to play such sound recording again from local storage on such computer or other device rather than by means of a transmission; provided that the user is only able to do so while maintaining a live network connection to the service, and such reproduction is encrypted or otherwise protected consistent with prevailing industry standards to prevent it from being played in any other manner or on any device other than the computer or other device on which it was originally made.</p><p class="depth0">Subscription service means a digital music service for which end users are required to pay a fee to access the service for defined subscription periods of 3 years or less (in contrast to, for example, a service where the basic charge to users is a payment per download or per play), whether such payment is made for access to the service on a standalone basis or as part of a bundle with one or more other products or services, and including any use of such a service on a trial basis without charge as described in Sec.  385.14(b).
