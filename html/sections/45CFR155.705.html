The SHOP must adhere to the requirements outlined in subpart H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer choice requirements. With regard to QHPs offered through the SHOP for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the SHOP must allow a qualified employer to select a level of coverage as described in section 1302(d)(1) of the Affordable Care Act, in which all QHPs within that level are made available to the qualified employees of the employer, unless the SHOP makes an election pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> SHOP options with respect to employer choice requirements.

A State Insurance Commissioner's recommendation must be based on concrete evidence, including but not limited to discussions with those issuers expected to participate in the SHOP in 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For plan years beginning in 2015 only, a State Insurance Commissioner should submit the recommendation specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section, and the SHOP should make a decision based on that recommendation sufficiently in advance of the end of the QHP certification application window such that issuers can make informed decisions about whether to participate in the SHOP. In a Federally-facilitated-SHOP, State Insurance Commissioners must submit to HHS the recommendation specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section on or before June 2, 2014, and HHS will make a decision based on any recommendations submitted by that deadline before

the close of the QHP certification application window.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> Premium aggregation.

Consistent with the effective dates set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the SHOP must perform the following functions related to premium payment administration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Provide each qualified employer with a bill on a monthly basis that identifies the employer contribution, the employee contribution, and the total amount that is due to the QHP issuers from the qualified employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Collect from each employer the total amount due and make payments to QHP issuers in the SHOP for all enrollees except as provided for in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Maintain books, records, documents, and other evidence of accounting procedures and practices of the premium aggregation program for each benefit year for at least 10 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The SHOP may establish one or more standard processes for premium calculation, premium payment, and premium collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The SHOP may, upon an election by a qualified employer, enter into an agreement with a qualified employer to facilitate the administration of continuation coverage by collecting premiums for continuation coverage enrolled in through the SHOP directly from a person enrolled in continuation coverage through the SHOP consistent with applicable law and the terms of the group health plan, and remitting premium payments for this coverage to QHP issuers. A Federally-facilitated SHOP may elect to limit this service to the collection of premiums related to continuation coverage required under 29 U.S.C. 1161, et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Qualified employers in a Federally-facilitated SHOP must make premium payments according to a timeline and process established by HHS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For a Federally-facilitated SHOP, the premium for coverage lasting less than 1 month must equal the product of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The premium for 1 month of coverage divided by the number of days in the month; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of days for which coverage is being provided in the month described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective dates. (A) A State-based SHOP may elect to perform these functions for plan years beginning before January 1, 2015, but need not do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A State-based SHOP may elect to perform these functions for plan years beginning before January 1, 2015, but need not do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Federally-facilitated SHOP will perform these functions only in plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> QHP Certification. With respect to certification of QHPs in the small group market, the SHOP must ensure each QHP meets the requirements specified in Sec. 156.285 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rates and rate changes. The SHOP must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Require all QHP issuers to make any change to rates at a uniform time that is no more frequently than quarterly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In a Federally-facilitated SHOP, rates may be updated quarterly with effective dates of January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1 of each calendar year, beginning with rates effective no sooner than July 1, 2014. The updated rates must be submitted to HHS at least 60 days in advance of the effective date of the rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prohibit all QHP issuers from varying rates for a qualified employer during the employer's plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> QHP availability in merged markets. If a State merges the individual market and the small group market risk pools in accordance with section 1312(c)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, the SHOP may permit a qualified employee to enroll in any QHP meeting level of coverage requirements described in section 1302(d) of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> QHP availability in unmerged markets. If a State does not merge the individual and small group market risk pools, the SHOP must permit each qualified employee to enroll only in QHPs in the small group market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> SHOP expansion to large group market. If a State elects to expand the SHOP to the large group market, a SHOP must allow issuers of health insurance coverage in the large group market in the State to offer QHPs in

such market through a SHOP beginning in 2017 provided that a large employer meets the qualified employer requirements other than that it be a small employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Participation rules. Subject to Sec. 147.104 of this subchapter, the SHOP may authorize a uniform group participation rate for the offering of health insurance coverage in the SHOP, which must be a single, uniform rate that applies to all groups and issuers in the SHOP. If the SHOP authorizes a minimum participation rate, such rate must be based on the rate of employee participation in the SHOP, not on the rate of employee participation in any particular QHP or QHPs of any particular issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For plan years beginning before January 1, 2016, subject to Sec. 147.104 of this subchapter, a Federally-facilitated SHOP must use a minimum participation rate of 70 percent, calculated as the number of qualified employees accepting coverage under the employer's group health plan, divided by the number of qualified employees offered coverage, excluding from the calculation any employee who, at the time the employer submits the SHOP application, is enrolled in coverage through another employer's group health plan or through a governmental plan such as Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE. For purposes of this calculation, qualified employees who are former employees will not be counted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, subject to Sec. 147.104 of this subchapter, a Federally-facilitated SHOP must use a minimum participation rate of 70 percent, calculated as the number of full-time employees accepting coverage offered by a qualified employer plus the number of full-time employees who, at the time the employer submits the SHOP group enrollment, are enrolled in coverage through another group health plan, governmental coverage (such as Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE), coverage sold through the individual market, or in other minimum essential coverage, divided by the number of full-time employees offered coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(10)(i) and (ii) of this section, a Federally-facilitated SHOP may utilize a different minimum participation rate in a State if there is evidence that a State law sets a minimum participation rate or that a higher or lower minimum participation rate is customarily used by the majority of QHP issuers in that State for products in the State's small group market outside the SHOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Premium calculator. In the SHOP, the premium calculator described in Sec. 155.205(b)(6) must facilitate the comparison of available QHPs after the application of any applicable employer contribution in lieu of any advance payment of the premium tax credit and any cost sharing reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To determine the employer and employee contributions, a SHOP may establish one or more standard methods that employers may use to define their contributions toward employee and dependent coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Federally-facilitated SHOP must use the following method for employer contributions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The employer will select a level of coverage as described in paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employer will select a QHP within that level of coverage to serve as a reference plan on which contributions will be based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The employer will define a percentage contribution toward premiums for employee-only coverage under the reference plan and, if dependent coverage is offered, a percentage contribution toward premiums for dependent coverage under the reference plan. To the extent permitted by other applicable law, for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, a Federally-facilitated SHOP may permit an employer to define a different percentage contribution for full-time employees from the percentage contribution it defines for non-full-time employees, and it may permit an employer to define a different percentage contribution for dependent coverage for full-time employees from the percentage contribution it defines for dependent coverage for non-full-time employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Either State law or the employer may require that a Federally-facilitated SHOP base contributions on a calculated composite premium for the reference plan for employees, for adult

dependents, and for dependents below age 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The resulting contribution amounts for each employee's coverage may then be applied toward the QHP selected by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Coordination with individual market Exchange for eligibility determinations. A SHOP must provide data related to eligibility and enrollment of a qualified employee to the individual market Exchange that corresponds to the service area of the SHOP, unless the SHOP is operated pursuant to Sec. 155.100(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Duties of Navigators in the SHOP. In States that have elected to operate only a SHOP pursuant to Sec. 155.100(a)(2), at State option and if State law permits the Navigator duties described in Sec. 155.210(e)(3) and (4) may be fulfilled through referrals to agents and brokers.
