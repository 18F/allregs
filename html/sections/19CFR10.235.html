The written declaration should be made by including  on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the symbol ``R'' as a  prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which the article in  question is classified. Except in any of the circumstances described in  Sec. 10.236(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must  be based on a complete and properly executed original Certificate of  Origin that covers the article being imported and that is in the  possession of the importer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Corrected declaration. If, after making the declaration required  under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe  that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains  information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar  days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected  declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration  will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to  the Customs port where the declaration was originally filed.</p>
