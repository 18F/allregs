                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The standard loan agreement between RUS and its  borrowers provides that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations  in this chapter, the borrower shall use standard forms of contract  promulgated by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services,  and architectural services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS.  (See section 5.16 of appendix A to subpart C of part 1718 of this  chapter.) This subpart prescribes RUS procedures in promulgating  standard contract forms and identifies those forms that borrowers are  required to use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contract forms. RUS promulgates standard contract forms,  identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, Sec. 1726.304(c),  that borrowers are required to use in accordance with the provisions of  this part. In addition, RUS promulgates standard contract forms  contained in Sec. 1726.304(d) that the borrowers may but are not  required to use in the construction of their electric systems. Borrowers  are not required to use these guidance contract forms in the absence of  an agreement to do so.  [63 FR 58286, Oct. 30, 1998]</p>
