                            <p class="depth0">The party requesting an advisory opinion may withdraw the request before CMS issues a formal advisory opinion. This party must submit the withdrawal in writing to the same address as the request, as indicated in Sec. 411.372(a). Even if the party withdraws the request, the party must pay the costs the Department has expended in processing the request, as discussed in Sec. 411.375. CMS reserves the right to keep any request for an advisory opinion and any accompanying documents and information, and to use them for any governmental purposes permitted by law.
