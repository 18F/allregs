All applications accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's lockbox bank in accordance with Sec. 1.1105, Schedule of Fees. The number of copies required for each application and the nonrefundable processing fees and any applicable regulatory fees (see subpart G of this part) which must accompany each application in order to qualify it for acceptance for filing and consideration are set forth in the rules in this chapter relating to various types of applications. However, if any application is not of the type covered by this chapter, an original and two copies of each such application shall be submitted.
