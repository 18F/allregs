An Initial Notice of Distribution of Digital Audio Recording Devices or Media shall be identified as such by prominent caption or heading, and shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The designation ``Importer'' or ``Manufacturer,'' or both, whichever is applicable, followed by the full legal name of the importer or manufacturer of the digital audio recording device or medium, or if the party named is a partnership, the name of the partnership followed by the name of at least one individual partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any trade or business name or names, trademarks, or other indicia of origin that the importer or manufacturer uses or intends to use in connection with the importation, manufacture, or distribution of such digital audio recording device or medium in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The full United States mailing address of the importer or manufacturer, and the full business address, if different;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The product category and technology of the devices or media imported or manufactured;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The first date (day, month, and year) that distribution commenced, or is to commence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The signature of an appropriate officer, partner, or agent of the importer or manufacturer, as specified by the Initial Notice form; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other information relevant to the importation or manufacture for distribution of digital audio recording devices or media as prescribed on the Initial Notice form provided by the Copyright Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Amendments.

The Copyright Office will advise manufacturers and importers of errors or omissions appearing on the face of documents submitted to it, and will require that any such obvious errors or omissions be corrected before the documents will be recorded. However, recordation by the Copyright Office shall establish only the fact and date thereof; such recordation shall in no case be considered a determination that the document was, in fact, properly prepared or that all of the regulatory requirements to satisfy section 1003 of title 17 have been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No fee shall be required for the recording of Initial Notices. The fee for filing an Amendment to an Initial Notice of Distribution of Digital Audio Recording Devices or Media is prescribed in Sec.  201.3(e).
