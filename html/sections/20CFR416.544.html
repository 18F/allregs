                                Sec. 416.544  Paying benefits in installments: Drug addiction
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For disabled recipients who receive benefit payments  through a representative payee because drug addiction or alcoholism is a  contributing factor material to the determination of disability, certain  amounts due the recipient for a past period will be paid in  installments. The amounts subject to payment in installments include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Benefits due but unpaid which accrued prior to the month payment  was effectuated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Benefits due but unpaid which accrued during a period of  suspension for which the recipient was subsequently determined to have  been eligible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any adjustment to benefits which results in an accrual of unpaid  benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installment formula. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section, the amount of the installment payment in any month is limited  so that the sum of (1) the amount due for a past period (and payable  under paragraph (a) of this section) paid in such month and (2) the  amount of any current benefit due cannot exceed twice the Federal  Benefit Rate plus any federally-administered State supplementation  payable to an eligible individual for the preceding month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception to installment limitation. An exception to the  installment payment limitation in paragraph (b) of this section can be  granted for the first month in which a recipient accrues benefit amounts  subject to payment in installments if the recipient has unpaid housing  expenses which result in a high risk of homelessness for the recipient.  In that case, the benefit payment may be increased by the amount of the  unpaid housing expenses so long as that increase does not exceed the  amount of benefits which accrued during the most recent period of  nonpayment. We consider a person to be at risk of homelessness if  continued nonpayment of the outstanding housing expenses is likely to  result in the person losing his or her place to live or if past  nonpayment of housing expenses has resulted in the person having no  appropriate personal place to live. In determining whether this  exception applies, we will ask for evidence of outstanding housing  expenses that shows that the person is likely to lose or has already  lost his or her place to live. For purposes of this section,  homelessness is the state of not being under the control of any public  institution and having no appropriate personal place to live. Housing  expenses include charges for all items required to maintain shelter (for  example, mortgage payments, rent, heating fuel, and electricity).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment through a representative payee. If the recipient does  not have a representative payee, payment of amounts subject to  installments cannot be made until a representative payee is selected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Underpaid recipient no longer eligible. In the case of a  recipient who is no longer currently eligible for monthly payments, but  to whom amounts defined in paragraph (a) of this section are still  owing, we will continue to make installment payments of such benefits  through a representative payee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recipient currently not receiving SSI benefits because of  suspension for noncompliance with treatment. If a recipient is currently  not receiving SSI benefits because his or her benefits have been  suspended for noncompliance with treatment (as defined in Sec. 416.936),  the payment of amounts under paragraph (a) of this section will stop  until the recipient has demonstrated compliance with treatment as  described in Sec. 416.1326 and will again commence with the first month  the recipient begins to receive benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Underpaid recipient deceased. Upon the death of a recipient, any  remaining unpaid amounts as defined in paragraph (a) of this section  will be treated as underpayments in accordance with Sec. 416.542(b).
