                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination by principal. A request by a principal to terminate  a bond shall be made in writing to the port director or drawback office  in the case of a bond relating to repayment of erroneous drawback  payment where the bond was approved. The termination shall take effect  on the date requested if the date is at least 10 business days after the  date of receipt of the request. Otherwise the termination shall be  effective on the close of business 10 business days after the request is  received at the port or drawback office. If no termination date is  requested, the termination shall take effect on the tenth business day  following the date of receipt of the request by the port director, or  drawback office in the case of bonds relating to repayment of erroneous  drawback payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination by surety. A surety may, with or without the consent  of the principal, terminate a Customs bond on which it is obligated. The  surety shall provide reasonable written notice to both the director of  the port where the bond was approved or appropriate drawback office in  the case of bonds relating to repayment of an erroneous drawback payment  and the principal of the intent to terminate. The written notice shall  state the date on which the termination shall be effective and shall be  sent to both Customs and the principal by certified mail, with a return  receipt requested. Thirty days shall constitute reasonable notice unless  the surety can show to the satisfaction of the port director, or  drawback office in the case of bonds relating to repayment of an  erroneous drawback payment, that a lesser time is reasonable under the  facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of termination. If a bond is terminated no new Customs  transactions shall be charged against the bond. A new bond in an  appropriate amount on Customs Form 301, containing the appropriate bond  conditions set forth in subpart G of this part, shall be filed before  further Customs activity may be transacted.
