In evaluating an  application, the OHA may also consider any other source of information,  and may conduct hearings or conferences either in response to requests  by parties in the proceeding or on its own initiative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information  upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information  is not submitted by the applicant, the OHA may dismiss the application  without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is  repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The OHA shall process applications for stay as expeditiously as  possible. When administratively feasible, the OHA shall grant or deny an  Application for Stay within 10 business days after receipt of the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of the DOE regulations, the  OHA may make a decision on any Application for Stay prior to the receipt  of written comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The criteria to be considered and weighed by the OHA in  determining whether a stay should be granted are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether a showing has been made that an irreparable injury will  result in the event that the stay is denied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether a showing has been made that a denial of the stay will  result in a more immediate hardship or inequity to the applicant than a  grant of the stay would cause to other persons affected by the  proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether a showing has been made that it would be desirable for  public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a decision by  OHA on the merits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether a showing has been made that it is impossible for the  applicant   to fulfill the requirements of an outstanding order or regulatory  provision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether a showing has been made that there is a strong  likelihood of success on the merits.</p>
