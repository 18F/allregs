                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RAB adjournment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for RAB adjournment. An  Installation Commander may adjourn a RAB with input from the community  when there is no longer a need for a RAB or when community interest in  the RAB no longer exists. An Installation Commander may consider  adjourning the RAB in the following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A record of decision has been signed for all DERP sites on the  installation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An installation has achieved response complete at all sites and  no further environmental restoration decisions are required,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An installation has all remedies in place,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The RAB has achieved the desired end goal as defined in the RAB  Operating Procedures,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> There is no longer sufficient, sustained community interest, as  documented by the installation with RAB community members and community- at-large input, to sustain the RAB. The installation shall continue to  monitor for any changes in community interest that could warrant  reactivating or reestablishing the RAB, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The installation has been transferred out of DoD control and  day-to-day responsibility for making restoration response decisions has  been assumed by the transferee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjournment procedures. If the Installation Commander is  considering   adjourning the RAB, the Installation Commander shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consult with EPA, state, tribes, RAB members, and the local  community, as appropriate, regarding adjourning the RAB and consider all  responses before making a final decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document the rationale for adjournment in a memorandum in a  memorandum for inclusion in the Administrative Record, notify the public  of the decision through written notice to the RAB members and through  publication of a notice in a local newspaper of general circulation, and  describe other ongoing public involvement opportunities that are  available if the Installation Commander decides to adjourn the RAB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RAB dissolution--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for RAB dissolution. An  Installation Commander may recommend dissolution of a RAB when a RAB is  no longer fulfilling the intended purpose of advising and providing  community input to an Installation Commander and decision makers on  environmental restoration projects as described in Sec. 202.1(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dissolution procedures. If the Installation Commander is  considering dissolving the RAB, the Installation Commander shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consult with EPA, state, tribal and local government  representatives, as appropriate, regarding dissolving the RAB.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the RAB community co-chair and members in writing of the  intent to dissolve the RAB and the reasons for doing so and provide the  RAB members 30 days to respond in writing. The Installation Commander  shall consider RAB member responses, and in consultation with EPA,  state, tribal and local government representatives, as appropriate,  determine the appropriate actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify the public of the proposal to dissolve the RAB and  provide a 30-day public comment period on the proposal, if the  Installation Commander decides to proceed with dissolution. At the  conclusion of the public comment period, the Installation Commander will  review the public comments, consult with EPA, state, tribal and local  government representatives, as appropriate, and, if the Installation  Commander still believes dissolution is appropriate, render a  recommendation to that effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Send the recommendation, responsiveness summary, and all  supporting documentation via the chain-of-command to the Military  Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) for  approval or disapproval. The Military Component's Environmental Deputy  Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) shall notify the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations & Environment) (or  equivalent) of the decision to approve or disapprove the request to  dissolve the RAB and the rationale for that decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Document the recommendation, responsiveness summary, and the  rationale for dissolution in a memorandum for inclusion in the  Administrative Record, notify the public of the decision through written  notice to the RAB members and through publication of a notice in a local  newspaper of general circulation and describe other ongoing public  involvement opportunities that are available, once the Military  Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent)  makes a final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reestablishing an adjourned or dissolved RAB. An Installation  Commander may reestablish an adjourned or dissolved RAB if there is  sufficient and sustained community interest in doing so, and there are  environmental restoration activities still ongoing at the installation  or that may start up again. Where a RAB is adjourned or dissolved and  environmental restoration activities continue, the Installation  Commander should reassess community interest at least every 24 months.  When all environmental restoration decisions have been made and required  remedies are in place and are properly operating at an installation,  reassessment of the community interest for reestablishing the RAB is not  necessary. When additional environmental restoration decisions have to  be made resulting from subsequent actions, such as long-term management  and five-year reviews, the installation will reassess community interest  for   reestablishing the RAB. Where the reassessment finds sufficient and  sustained community interest at previously adjourned or dissolved RABs,  the Installation Commander should reestablish a RAB. Where the  reassessment does not find sufficient and sustained community interest  in reestablishing the RAB, the Installation Commander shall document in  a memorandum for the record the procedures followed in the reassessment  and the findings of the reassessment. This document shall be included in  the Administrative Record for the installation. If there is interest in  reestablishment at a previously dissolved RAB, but the Installation  Commander determines that the same conditions exist that required the  original dissolution, he or she will request, through the chain-of- command to the Military Component's Deputy Assistant Secretary, an  exception to reestablishing the RAB. If those conditions no longer exist  at a previously dissolved RAB, and there is sufficient and sustained  interest in reestablishment, the Installation Commander should recommend  to the Deputy Assistant Secretary that the RAB be reestablished. The  Deputy Assistant Secretary will take the Installation Commander's  recommendation under advisement and may approve that RAB for  reestablishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public comment. If the Installation Commander intends to  recommend dissolution of a RAB or reestablish a dissolved RAB, the  Installation Commander shall notify the public of the proposal to  dissolve or reestablish the RAB and provide a 30-day public comment  period on the proposal. At the conclusion of the public comment period,  the Installation Commander shall review public comments; consult with  EPA and state, tribal, or local government representatives, as  appropriate; prepare a responsiveness summary; and render a  recommendation. The recommendation, responsiveness summary, and all  supporting documentation should be sent via the chain-of-command to the  Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or  equivalent) for approval or disapproval. The Installation Commander  shall notify the public of the decision.</p>
