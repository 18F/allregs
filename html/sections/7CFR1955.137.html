                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Real property located in flood, mudslide hazard, wetland or  Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use restrictions. Executive  Order 11988, ``Floodplain Management,'' and Executive Order 11990,  ``Protection of Wetlands,'' require the conveyance instrument for  inventory property containing floodplains or wetlands which is proposed  for lease or sale to specify those uses that are restricted under  identified Federal, State and local floodplains or wetlands regulations  as well as other appropriate restrictions. The restrictions shall be to  the uses of the property by the lessee or purchaser and any successors,  except where prohibited by law. Applicable restrictions will be  incorporated into quitclaim deeds in a format similar to that contained  in Exhibits H and I of RD Instruction 1955-C (available in any Agency  office). A listing of all restrictions will be included in the notices  required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of hazards. Acquired real property located in an  identified special flood or mudslide hazard area as defined in, subpart  B of part 1806 of this chapter will not be sold for residential purposes  unless determined by the county official or district director to   be safe (that is, any hazard that exists would not likely endanger the  safety of dwelling occupants).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitations placed on financial assistance. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Financial  assistance is limited to property located in areas where flood insurance  is available. Flood insurance must be provided at closing of loans on  program-eligible and nonprogram (NP)-ineligible terms. Appraisals of  property in flood or mudslide hazard areas will reflect this condition  and any restrictions on use. Financial assistance for substantial  improvement or repair of property located in a flood or mudslide hazard  area is subject to the limitations outlined in, paragraph 3b (1) and (2)  of Exhibit C of subpart G of part 1940.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to the requirements of the Coastal Barrier Resources  Act (CBRA) and except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this  section, no credit sales will be provided for property located within a  CBRS where:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It is known that the purchaser plans to further develop the  property;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A subsequent loan or any other type of Federal financial  assistance as defined by the CBRA has been requested for additional  development of the property;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The sale is inconsistent with the purpose of the CBRA; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The property to be sold was the subject of a previous financial  transaction that violated the CBRA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this section, additional development means the  expansion, but not maintenance, replacement-in-kind, reconstruction, or  repair of any roads, structures or facilities. Water and waste disposal  facilities as well as community facilities may be repaired to the extent  required to meet health and safety requirements, but may not be improved  or expanded to serve new users, patients or residents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A sale which is not in conflict with the limitations in  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section shall not be completed until the  approval official has consulted with the appropriate Regional Director  of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Regional Director concurs  that the proposed sale does not violate the provisions of the CBRA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any proposed sale that does not conform to the requirements of  paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section must be forwarded to the  Administrator for review. Approval will not be granted unless the  Administrator determines, through consultation with the Department of  Interior, that the proposed sale does not violate the provisions of the  CBRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wetlands located on FSA inventory property. Perpetual wetland  conservation easements (encumbrances in deeds) to protect and restore  wetlands or converted wetlands that exist on suitable or surplus  inventory property will be established prior to sale of such property.  The provisions of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section also apply,  as does paragraph (a)(1) of this section insofar as floodplains are  concerned. This requirement applies to either cash or credit sales.  Similar restrictions will be included in leases of inventory properties  to beginning farmers or ranchers. Wetland conservation easements will be  established as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All wetlands or converted wetlands located on FSA inventory  property which were not considered cropland on the date the property was  acquired and were not used for farming at any time during the period  beginning on the date 5 years before the property was acquired and  ending on the date the property was acquired will receive a wetland  conservation easement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All wetlands or converted wetlands located on FSA inventory  property that were considered cropland on the date the property was  acquired or were used for farming at any time during the period  beginning on the date 5 years before the property was acquired and  ending on the date the property was acquired will not receive a wetland  conservation easement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following steps should be taken in determining if  conservation easements are necessary for the protection of wetlands or  converted wetland on inventory property:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NRCS will be contacted first to identify the wetlands or  converted wetlands and wetland boundaries of each wetland or converted  wetland on inventory property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After receiving the wetland determination from NRCS, FSA will  review   the determination for each inventory property and determine if any of  the wetlands or converted wetlands identified by NRCS were considered  cropland on the date the property was acquired or were used for farming  at any time during the period beginning on the date 5 years before the  property was acquired and ending on the date the property was acquired.  Property will be considered to have been used for farming if it was  primarily used for agricultural purposes including but not limited to  such uses as cropland, pasture, hayland, orchards, vineyards and tree  farming.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After FSA has completed the determination of whether the  wetlands or converted wetlands located on an inventory property were  used for cropland or farming, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)  will be contacted. Based on the technical considerations of the  potential functions and values of the wetlands on the property, FWS will  identify those wetlands or converted wetlands that require protection  with a wetland conservation easement along with the boundaries of the  required wetland conservation easement. FWS may also make other  recommendations if needed for the protection of important resources such  as threatened or endangered species during this review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The wetland conservation easement will provide for access to  other portions of the property as necessary for farming and other uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The appraisal of the property must be updated to reflect the  value of the land due to the conservation easement on the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Easement areas shall be described in accordance with State or  local laws. If State or local law does not require a survey, the  easement area can be described by rectangular survey, plat map, or other  recordable methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In most cases the FWS shall be responsible for easement  management and administration responsibilities for such areas unless the  wetland easement area is an inholding in Federal or State property and  that entity agrees to assume such responsibility, or a State fish and  wildlife agency having counterpart responsibilities to the FWS is  willing to assume easement management and administration  responsibilities. The costs associated with such easement management  responsibilities shall be the responsibility of the agency that assumes  easement management and administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> County officials are encouraged to begin the easement process  before the property is taken into inventory, if possible, in order to  have the program completed before the statutory time requirement for  sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Historic preservation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to the requirements of the  National Historic Preservation Act and Executive Order 11593,  ``Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,'' the Agency  official responsible for the conveyance must determine if the property  is listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of  Historic Places. (See subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter for  additional guidance.) The State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)  must be consulted whenever one of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The property includes a structure that is more than 50 years  old.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regardless of age, the property is known to be of historical or  archaeological importance; has apparent significant architectural  features; or is similar to other Agency properties that have been  determined to be eligible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An environmental assessment is required prior to a decision on  the conveyance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the result of the consultations with the SHPO is that a  property may be eligible or that it is questionable, an official  determination must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a property is listed on the National Register or is  determined eligible for listing by the Secretary of Interior, the Agency  official responsible for the conveyance must consult with the SHPO in  order to develop any necessary restrictions on the use of the property  so that the future use will be compatible with preservation objectives  and which does not result in an unreasonable economic burden to public  or private interest. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation must  be consulted by the State Director or   State Executive Director after the discussions with the SHPO are  concluded regardless of whether or not an agreement is reached.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any restrictions that are developed on the use of the property  as a result of the above consultations must be made known to a potential  bidder or purchaser through a notice procedure similar to that in Sec.  1955.13(a)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Highly erodible farmland. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FSA county official will  determine if any inventory property contains highly erodible land as  defined by the NRCS and, if so, what specific conservation practices  will be made a condition of a sale of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the county official does not concur in the need for a  conservation practice recommended by NRCS, any differences shall be  discussed with the recommending NRCS office. Failure to reach an  agreement at that level shall require the State Executive Director to  make a final decision after consultation with the NRCS State  Conservationist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever NRCS technical assistance is requested in implementing  these requirements and NRCS responds that it cannot provide such  assistance within a time frame compatible with the proposed sale, the  sale arrangements will go forward. The sale will proceed, conditioned on  the requirement that a purchaser will immediately contact (NRCS) have a  conservation plan developed and comply with this plan. The county  official will monitor the borrower's compliance with the recommendations  in the conservation plan. If problems occur in obtaining NRCS  assistance, the State Executive Director should consult with the NRCS  State Conservationist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification to purchasers of inventory property with reportable  underground storage tanks. If the Agency is selling inventory property  containing a storage tank which was reported to the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1955.57 of  subpart B of this part, the potential purchaser will be informed of the  reporting requirement and provided a copy of the report filed by the  Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Real property that is unsafe. If the Agency has in inventory,  real property, exclusive of any improvements, that is unsafe, that is it  does not meet the definition of ``safe'' as contained in Sec. 1955.103  of this subpart and which cannot be feasibly made safe, the State  Director or State Executive Director will submit the case file, together  with documentation of the hazard and a recommended course of action to  the National Office, ATTN: appropriate Deputy Administrator, for review  and guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Real property containing hazardous waste contamination. All  inventory property must be inspected for hazardous waste contamination  either through the use of a preliminary hazardous waste site survey or  Transaction Screen Questionnaire. If possible contamination is noted, a  Phase I or II environmental assessment will be completed per the advice  of the State Environmental Coordinator.
