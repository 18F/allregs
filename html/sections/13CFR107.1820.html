In this regard:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are not considered to have a condition of extreme Capital Impairment during the first eight years following your first issuance of Participating Securities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This paragraph (b)(1) does not give you an additional opportunity to cure if you have already had an opportunity to cure your Capital Impairment under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary assignment. You make a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bankruptcy.

Upon the occurrence (as determined by SBA) of any of the following conditions (``Contingent Removal Conditions''), SBA may avail itself of one or more of the remedies in paragraph (d) of this section, but only if you fail to remove the person(s) SBA identifies as responsible for such occurrence and/or cure such occurrence to SBA's satisfaction within a time period determined by SBA (but not less than 15 days):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Willful conflicts of interest.
