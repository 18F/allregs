                                Sec. 209.15  Compensation reportable when paid.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In preparing a report required under this part, an  employer may report compensation in the report required for the year in  which the compensation was paid even though such compensation was earned  by the employee in a previous year. If compensation is reported with  respect to the year in which it was paid, it shall be credited by the  Board to the employee in such year unless within the four year period  provided in Sec. 211.15 of this chapter the employee requests that such  compensation be credited to the year in which it was earned. If the  employee makes such a request, and the Board determines that the  compensation should be credited to the year in which it was earned, the  reporting employer must file an adjustment report as required by Sec.  209.9 of this part which reports such compensation in the year in which  it was earned. The employee may revoke his or her request anytime prior  to the filing of the adjustment report. Upon the Board's receipt of the  adjustment report, the request becomes irrevocable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pay for time lost. Compensation which is pay for time lost, as  provided in Sec. 211.3 of this chapter, shall be reported with respect  to the period in which the time and compensation were lost. For example,  if an employee is off work because of an on-the-job injury for a period  of months in a given year and in a later year receives a payment from  his or her employer to compensate for wages lost during the period of  absence, the employer must, by way of adjustment provided for in Sec.  209.9 of this part, report the compensation with respect to the year in  which the time and compensation were lost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Separation allowance or severance pay. A separation allowance or  severance payment shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 209.14 of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Miscellaneous pay. Miscellaneous pay, as defined in Sec. 211.11  of this chapter, shall be reported in the year paid and reported on the  annual report of compensation as provided for in Sec. 209.8 of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vacation pay. Vacation pay may be reported in accordance with  this section except that any payments made in the year following the  year in which the employee resigns or is discharged shall be reported by  way of adjustment under Sec. 209.9 of this part as paid in the year of  resignation or discharge.
