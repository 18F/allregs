                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Non-Federal entities are encouraged to earn income to  defray program costs where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal  regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to the generation of  program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program  income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Governmental revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies,  fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not  program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the  Federal award or HHS awarding agency regulations as program income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Patent and Trademark Laws Amendments, 34 U.S.C. 200-212,  apply to inventions made under an award for performance of experimental,  developmental, or research work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the terms and conditions for the Federal award provide  otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to HHS with respect to  program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted  material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made  under a Federal award. However, no scholarship, fellowship, training  grant, or other funding agreement made primarily to a recipient for  educational purposes will contain any provision giving the HHS awarding  agency rights to inventions made by the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or  supplies, are not program income; such proceeds will be handled in  accordance with the requirements of subpart D of this part, Sec. Sec.  75.318, 75.320, and 75.321, or as specifically identified in Federal  statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> and (3) of this section,  program income in excess of any amounts specified must also be deducted  from expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deduction. Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total  allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income  must be used for current costs unless the HHS awarding agency authorizes  otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate  at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal  award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the  funds committed to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Addition. With prior approval of the HHS awarding agency (except  for IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, as described in paragraph  (e) of this section), program income may be added to the Federal award  by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. The program income  must be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the Federal  award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost sharing or matching. With prior approval of the HHS  awarding agency, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or  matching requirement of the Federal award. The amount of the Federal  award remains the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Income after the period of performance. There are no Federal  requirements governing the disposition of income earned after the end of  the period of performance for the Federal award, unless the HHS awarding  agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide  otherwise. The HHS awarding agency may negotiate agreements with  recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the period  of performance as part of the grant closeout process. See also Sec.  75.381.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unless the Federal statute, regulations, or terms and conditions  for the Federal award provide otherwise, the non-Federal entity has no  obligation to the HHS awarding agency with respect to program income  earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material,  patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a  Federal award to which 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by  Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms under Government  Awards, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements'' is applicable.</p>
