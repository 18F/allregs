Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.001-1 is identical and applicable to Sec. 86.005-1, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.001-1.''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this subpart generally apply to 2005 and later model year new Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines used in incomplete vehicles and vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR and 2005 and later model year new diesel-cycle heavy-duty engines. In cases where a provision applies only to a certain vehicle group based on its model year, vehicle class, motor fuel, engine type, or other distinguishing characteristics, the limited applicability is cited in the appropriate section or paragraph. The provisions of this subpart continue to generally apply to 2000 and earlier model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles, 2000 and earlier model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty trucks, and 2004 and earlier model year new Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR. Provisions generally applicable to 2001 and later model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles, 2001 and later model year new Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle light-duty trucks, and 2005 and later model year Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR are located in subpart S of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional applicability. (1) A manufacturer may request to certify any 2003 or 2004 model year heavy-duty vehicle of 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating or less in accordance with the light-duty truck provisions located in subpart S of this part. Heavy-duty engine or vehicle provisions of this subpart A do not apply to such a

vehicle. This option is not available in the 2003 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 1 in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or in the 2004 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 2 in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may request to certify any 2003 or 2004 model year heavy-duty vehicle of 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating or less in accordance with the light-duty truck provisions located in subpart S of this part.

vehicle. This option is not available in the 2003 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 1 in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or in the 2004 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 2 in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For 2005 and later model years, a manufacturer may request to certify any incomplete Otto-cycle heavy-duty vehicle of 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating or less in accordance with the provisions for Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles located in subpart S of this part. Heavy-duty engine or heavy-duty vehicle provisions of this subpart A do not apply to such a vehicle. This option is available starting with the 2003 model year to manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 1 in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This option is available starting with the 2004 model year to manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 2 in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

The emission standards and other requirements that apply under a given option shall apply to all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles certified by the manufacturer (e.g., a manufacturer may not select one option for certain engine families and the other option for other engine families). The requirements under each option shall remain effective, once selected, for subsequent model years, until superceded or otherwise revised by the Administrator (e.g., a manufacturer may not select one option prior to the 2004 model year and change to another option in the 2006 model year). The complete requirements under each option are contained in subparts A and S of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Otto-cycle HDE Option 1.
