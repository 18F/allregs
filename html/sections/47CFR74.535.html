The total peak  frequency deviation will be determined by adding the deviation produced  by the digital modulation signal and the deviation produced by any  frequency division multiplex (FDM) modulation used. The deviation (D)  produced by the FDM signal must be determined in accordance with Sec.   2.202(f) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transmitter modulates two or more carriers, with at least  one using digital modulation and one using frequency or other analog  modulation, digital modulation techniques are considered as being  employed when the   necessary bandwidth of the digital signal(s) is 50 percent or more of  the aggregate bandwidth of the system, comprising the digital necessary  bandwidth(s), the analog necessary bandwidth(s), and any bandwidth(s)  between the digital and analog necessary bandwidths. In this case, the  aggregate bandwidth shall be used for the authorized bandwidth (B) in  paragraph (a) of this section, and for purposes of compliance with the  bandwidth limitations in Sec.  74.502 of this subpart; and the sum of  the powers of the analog and digital signals shall be used for mean  transmitter power (PMEAN) in paragraph (a) or the peak  envelope transmitter power (PPEAK) in paragraph (b) of this  section, and for purposes of compliance with the power limitations in  Sec.  74.534 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For demonstrating compliance with the attenuation requirements  for frequency modulation and digital modulation in paragraph (a) of this  section, the resolution bandwidth (BRES) of the measuring  equipment used for measurements removed from the center frequency by  more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth shall be 100 kHz for  operating frequencies below 1 GHz, and 1 MHz for operating frequencies  above 1 GHz. The resolution bandwidth for frequencies removed from the  center frequency by less than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth  shall be the reference bandwidth (BREF) specified in the  individual emission limitations, but may be reduced to not less than one  percent of the authorized bandwidth (B), adjusted upward to the nearest  greater resolution bandwidth available on the measuring equipment. In  all cases, if BRES and BREF are not equal, then  the attenuation requirement must be increased (or decreased) as  determined by a factor of 10 log10 [(BREF in  megahertz)/(BRES in megahertz)] decibels, where a positive  factor indicates an increase in the attenuation requirement and a  negative factor indicates a decrease in the attenuation requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stations licensed pursuant to an application filed before March  17, 2005, using equipment not conforming with the emission limitations  specified above, may continue to operate indefinitely in accordance with  the terms of their current authorizations, subject to periodic renewal.  Existing equipment and equipment of product lines in production before  April 16, 2003, authorized via certification or verification before  March 17, 2005, for equipment not conforming to the emission limitations  requirements specified above, may continue to be manufactured and/or  marketed, but may not be authorized for use under a station license  except at stations licensed pursuant to an application filed before  March 17, 2005. Any non-conforming equipment authorized under a station  license, and replaced on or after March 17, 2005, must be replaced by  conforming equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following limitations apply to the operation of aural  broadcast microwave booster stations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The booster station must receive and amplify the signals of the  originating station and retransmit them on the same frequency without  significantly altering them in any way. The characteristics of the  booster transmitter output signal shall meet the requirements applicable  to the signal of the originating station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee is responsible for correcting any condition of  interference that results from the radiation of radio frequency energy  outside the assigned channel. Upon notice by the FCC to the station  licensee that interference is being caused, operation of the apparatus  must be immediately suspended and may not be resumed until the  interference has been eliminated or it can be demonstrated that the  interference is not due to spurious emissions. However, short term test  transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to  determine the efficacy of remedial measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In each instance where suspension of operation is required, the  licensee must submit a full report to the FCC after operation is  resumed. The report must contain details of the nature of the  interference, the source of interfering signals, and the remedial steps  taken to eliminate the interference.
