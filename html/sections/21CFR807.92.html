                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A 510(k) summary shall be in sufficient detail to provide an  understanding of the basis for a determination of substantial  equivalence. FDA will accept summaries as well as amendments thereto  until such time as FDA issues a determination of substantial  equivalence. All 510(k) summaries   shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The submitter's name, address, telephone number, a contact  person, and the date the summary was prepared;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the device, including the trade or proprietary name  if applicable, the common or usual name, and the classification name, if  known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An identification of the legally marketed device to which the  submitter claims equivalence. A legally marketed device to which a new  device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial  equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976,  or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I  (the predicate), or a device which has been found to be substantially  equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the device that is the subject of the premarket  notification submission, such as might be found in the labeling or  promotional material for the device, including an explanation of how the  device functions, the scientific concepts that form the basis for the  device, and the significant physical and performance characteristics of  the device, such as device design, material used, and physical  properties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement of the intended use of the device that is the  subject of the premarket notification submission, including a general  description of the diseases or conditions that the device will diagnose,  treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate, including a description, where  appropriate, of the patient population for which the device is intended.  If the indication statements are different from those of the legally  marketed device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the  510(k) summary shall contain an explanation as to why the differences  are not critical to the intended therapeutic, diagnostic, prosthetic, or  surgical use of the device, and why the differences do not affect the  safety and effectiveness of the device when used as labeled; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the device has the same technological characteristics (i.e.,  design, material, chemical composition, energy source) as the predicate  device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a summary of the  technological characteristics of the new device in comparison to those  of the predicate device. If the device has different technological  characteristics from the predicate device, a summary of how the  technological characteristics of the device compare to a legally  marketed device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 510(k) summaries for those premarket submissions in which a  determination of substantial equivalence is also based on an assessment  of performance data shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief discussion of the nonclinical tests submitted,  referenced, or relied on in the premarket notification submission for a  determination of substantial equivalence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief discussion of the clinical tests submitted, referenced,  or relied on in the premarket notification submission for a  determination of substantial equivalence. This discussion shall include,  where applicable, a description of the subjects upon whom the device was  tested, a discussion of the safety or effectiveness data obtained from  the testing, with specific reference to adverse effects and  complications, and any other information from the clinical testing  relevant to a determination of substantial equivalence; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The summary should be in a separate section of the submission,  beginning on a new page and ending on a page not shared with any other  section of the premarket notification submission, and should be clearly  identified as a ``510(k) summary.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any other information reasonably deemed necessary by the agency.  [57 FR 18066, Apr. 28, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 64295, Dec. 14, 1994]</p>
