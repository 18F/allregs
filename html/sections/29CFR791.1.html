To the extent that prior administrative rulings, interpretations, practices, and enforcement policies relating to sections 3 (d), (e) and (g) of the Act, which define the terms ``employer'', ``employee'', and ``employ'', are inconsistent or in conflict with the principles stated in this part they are hereby rescinded. The interpretations contained in this part may be relied upon in accordance with section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, \3\ so long as they remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial authority to be incorrect.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ 29 U.S.C. 201-219.
