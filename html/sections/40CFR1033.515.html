                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to test locomotives at each notch setting  so that emissions can be weighted according to either the line-haul duty  cycle or the switch duty cycle. The locomotive test cycle consists of a  warm-up followed by a sequence of nominally steady-state discrete test  modes, as described in Table 1 to this section. The test modes are  steady-state with respect to operator demand, which is the notch setting  for the locomotive. Engine speeds and loads are not necessarily steady- state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Follow the provisions of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart F for general  pre-test procedures (including engine and sampling system pre- conditioning which is included as engine warm-up). You may operate the  engine in any way you choose to warm it up prior to beginning the sample  preconditioning specified in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Begin the test by operating the locomotive over the pre-test  portion of the cycle specified in Table 1 to this section. For  locomotives not equipped with catalysts, you may begin the test as soon  as the engine reaches its lowest idle setting. For catalyst-equipped  locomotives, you may begin the test in normal idle mode if the engine  does not reach its lowest idle setting within 15 minutes. If you do  start in normal idle, run the low idle mode after normal idle, then  resume the specified mode sequence (without repeating the normal idle  mode).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Measure emissions during the rest of the test cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each test mode begins when the operator demand to the locomotive  or engine is set to the applicable notch setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Start measuring gaseous emissions, power, and fuel consumption  at the start of the test mode A and continue until the completion of  test mode 8. You may zero and span analyzers between modes (or take  other actions consistent with good engineering judgment).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sample period over which emissions for the mode are averaged  generally begins when the operator demand is changed to start the test  mode and ends within 5 seconds of the minimum sampling time for the test  mode is reached. However, you need to shift the sampling period to  account for sample system residence times. Follow the provisions of 40  CFR 1065.308 and 1065.309 to time align emission and work measurements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sample period is 300 seconds for all test modes except mode  10. The sample period for test mode 8 is 600 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If gaseous emissions are sampled using a batch-sampling method,  begin proportional sampling at the beginning of each sampling period and  terminate   sampling once the minimum time in each test mode is reached, 5 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If applicable, begin the smoke test at the start of the test  mode A. Continue collecting smoke data until the completion of test mode  8. Refer to Sec.  1033.101 to determine applicability of smoke testing  and Sec.  1033.525 for details on how to conduct a smoke test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Begin proportional sampling of PM emissions at the beginning of  each sampling period and terminate sampling within 5 seconds of the specified time in each test mode. If  the PM sample is not sufficiently large, take one of the following  actions consistent with good engineering judgment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Extend the sampling period up to a maximum of 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Group the modes in the same manner as the phases of the ramped  modal cycle and use three different dilution settings for the groups.  Use one setting for both idle modes, one for dynamic brake through notch  5, and one for notches 6 through 8. For each group, ensure that the mode  with the highest exhaust flow (typically normal idle, notch 5, and notch  8) meets the criteria for minimum dilution ratio in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proceed through each test mode in the order specified in Table 1  to this section until the locomotive test cycle is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> At the end of each numbered test mode, you may continue to  operate sampling and dilution systems to allow corrections for the  sampling system's response time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Following the completion of Mode 8, conduct the post sampling  procedures in Sec.  1065.530. Note that cycle validation criteria do not  apply to testing of complete locomotives.</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Sec.   1033.515--Locomotive Test Cycle ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Time in mode        Sample averaging period for</p><p class="depth3">Test mode                  Notch setting          (minutes) \1\              emissions \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-test idle.....................

Use a separate PM filter sample for each test mode of the locomotive  test cycle according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a)  through (c) of this section. You may ask to use a shorter sampling  period if the total mass expected to be collected would cause  unacceptably high pressure drop across the filter before reaching the  end of the required sampling time. We will not allow sampling times  shorter than 60 seconds. When we conduct locomotive emission tests, we  will adhere to the time limits for each of the numbered modes in Table 1  to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engines certified to a PM standard/FEL below 0.05 g/bhp-hr. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  You may use separate PM filter samples for each test mode as described  in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; however, we recommend that you do  not. The low rate of sample filter loading will result in very long  sampling times and the large number of filter samples may induce  uncertainty stack-up that will lead to unacceptable PM measurement  accuracy. Instead, we recommend that you   measure PM emissions as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may use a single PM filter for sampling PM over all of the  test modes of the locomotive test cycle as specified in this paragraph  (d)(2). Vary the sample time to be proportional to the applicable line- haul or switch weighting factors specified in Sec.  1033.530 for each  mode. The minimum sampling time for each mode is 400 seconds multiplied  by the weighting factor. For example, for a mode with a weighting factor  of 0.030, the minimum sampling time is 12.0 seconds. PM sampling in each  mode must be proportional to engine exhaust flow as specified in 40 CFR  part 1065. Begin proportional sampling of PM emissions at the beginning  of each test mode as is specified in paragraph (c) of this section. End  the sampling period for each test mode so that sampling times are  proportional to the weighting factors for the applicable duty cycles. If  necessary, you may extend the time limit for each of the test modes  beyond the sampling times in Table 1 to this section to increase the  sampled mass of PM emissions or to account for proper weighting of the  PM emission sample over the entire cycle, using good engineering  judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> describes how to test locomotive engines when  not installed in a locomotive. Note that the test procedures for  dynamometer engine testing of locomotive engines are intended to produce  emission measurements that are the same as emission measurements  produced during testing of complete locomotives using the same engine  configuration. The following requirements apply for all engine tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify a second-by-second set of engine speed and load points  that are representative of in-use locomotive operation for each of the  set-points of the locomotive test cycle described in Table 1 to this  section, including transitions from one notch to the next. This is your  reference cycle for validating your cycle. You may ignore points between  the end of the sampling period for one mode and the point at which you  change the notch setting to begin the next mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Keep the temperature of the air entering the engine after any  charge air cooling to within 5 [deg]C of the typical intake manifold air  temperature when the engine is operated in the locomotive under similar  ambient conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proceed as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this  section for testing complete locomotives.
