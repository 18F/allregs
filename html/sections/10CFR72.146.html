                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The licensee, applicant for a license, certificate holder, and  applicant for a CoC shall establish measures to ensure that applicable  regulatory requirements and the design basis, as specified in the  license or CoC application for those structures, systems, and components  to which this section applies, are correctly translated into  specifications, drawings, procedures, and instructions. These measures  must include provisions to ensure that appropriate quality standards are  specified and included in design documents and that deviations from  standards are controlled. Measures must be established for the selection  and review for suitability of application of materials, parts,  equipment, and processes that are essential to the functions of the  structures, systems, and components which are important to safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The licensee, applicant for a license, certificate holder, and  applicant for a CoC shall establish measures for the identification and  control of design interfaces and for coordination among participating  design organizations. These measures must include the establishment of  written procedures among participating design organizations for the  review, approval, release, distribution, and revision of documents  involving design interfaces. The design control measures must provide  for verifying or checking the adequacy of design by methods such as  design reviews, alternate or simplified calculational methods, or by a  suitable testing program. For the verifying or checking process, the  licensee and certificate holder shall designate individuals or groups  other than those who were responsible for the original design, but who  may be from the same organization. Where a test program is used to  verify the adequacy of a specific design feature in lieu of other  verifying or checking processes, the licensee and certificate holder  shall include suitable qualification testing of a prototype or sample  unit under the   most adverse design conditions. The licensee, applicant for a license,  certificate holder, and applicant for a CoC shall apply design control  measures to items such as the following: criticality physics, radiation,  shielding, stress, thermal, hydraulic, and accident analyses;  compatibility of materials; accessibility for inservice inspection,  maintenance, and repair; features to facilitate decontamination; and  delineation of acceptance criteria for inspections and tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The licensee, applicant for a license, certificate holder, and  applicant for a CoC shall subject design changes, including field  changes, to design control measures commensurate with those applied to  the original design. Changes in the conditions specified in the license  or CoC require prior NRC approval.</p>
