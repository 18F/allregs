                                Sec. 4.175  Meeting requirements for health, welfare, and/or pension
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining the required amount of benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Most fringe  benefit determinations containing health and welfare and/or pension  requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf of each service  employee. These payments are usually also stated as weekly or monthly  amounts. As set forth in Sec. 4.172, unless specified otherwise in the  applicable determination such payments are due for all hours paid for,  including paid vacation, sick leave, and holiday hours, up to a maximum  of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year on each contract. The  application of this rule can be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An employee who works 4 days a week, 10 hours a day is entitled  to 40 hours of health and welfare and/or pension fringe benefits. If an  employee works 3 days a week, 12 hours a day, then such employee is  entitled to 36 hours of these benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An employee who works 32 hours in a workweek and also receives  8 hours of holiday pay is entitled to the maximum of 40 hours of health  and welfare and/or pension payments in that workweek. If the employee  works more than 32 hours and also received 8 hours of holiday pay, the  employee is still only entitled to the maximum of 40 hours of health and  welfare and/or pension payments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an employee is off work for two weeks on vacation and  received 80 hours of vacation pay, the employee must also receive  payment for the 80 hours of health and welfare and/or pension benefits  which accrue during the vacation period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An employee entitled to two weeks paid vacation who instead  works the full 52 weeks in the year, receiving the full 2,080 hours  worth of health and welfare and/or pension benefits, would be due an  extra 80 hours of vacation pay in lieu of actually taking the vacation;  however, such an employee would not be entitled to have an additional 80  hours of health and welfare and/or pension benefits included in his  vacation pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A fringe benefit determination calling for a specified benefit  such as health insurance contemplates a fixed and definite contribution  to a ``bona fide'' plan (as that term is defined in Sec. 4.171) by an  employer on behalf of each employee, based on the monetary cost to the  employer rather than on the level of benefits provided. Therefore, in  determining compliance with an applicable fringe benefit determination,  the amount of the employer's contribution on behalf of each individual  employee governs. Thus, as set forth in Sec. 4.172, if a determination  should require a contribution to a plan providing a specified fringe  benefit and that benefit can be obtained for less than the required  contribution, it would be necessary for the employer to make up the  difference in cash to the employee, or furnish equivalent benefits, or a  combination thereof. The following illustrates the application of this  principle: A fringe benefit determination requires a rate of $36.40 per  month per employee for a health insurance plan. The employer obtains the  health insurance coverage specified at a rate of $20.45 per month for a  single employee, $30.60 for an employee with spouse, and $40.90 for an  employee with a family. The employer is required to make up the  difference in cash or equivalent benefits to the first two classes of  employees in order to satisfy   the determination, notwithstanding that coverage for an employee would  be automatically changed by the employer if the employee's status should  change (e.g., single to married) and notwithstanding that the employer's  average contribution per employee may be equal to or in excess of $36.40  per month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining eligibility for benefits under certain wage  determinations containing hours or length of service requirements (such  as having to work 40 hours in the preceding month), the contractor must  take into account time spent by employees on commercial work as well as  time spent on the Government contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Some fringe benefit determinations specifically provide for  health and welfare and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost.  Under this concept, a contractor's contributions per employee to a  ``bona fide'' fringe benefit plan are permitted to vary depending upon  the individual employee's marital or employment status. However, the  firm's total contributions for all service employees enrolled in the  plan must average at least the fringe benefit determination requirement  per hour per service employee. If the contractor's contributions average  less than the amount required by the determination, then the firm must  make up the deficiency by making cash equivalent payments or equivalent  fringe benefit payments to all service employees in the plan who worked  on the contract during the payment period. Where such deficiencies are  made up by means of cash equivalent payments, the payments must be made  promptly on the following payday. The following illustrates the  application of this principle: The determination requires an average  contribution of $0.84 an hour. The contractor makes payments to bona  fide fringe benefit plans on a monthly basis. During a month the firm  contributes $15,000 for the service employees employed on the contract  who are enrolled in the plan, and a total of 20,000 man-hours had been  worked by all service employees during the month. Accordingly, the  firm's average cost would have been $15,000/20,000 hours or $0.75 per  hour, resulting in a deficiency of $0.09 per hour. Therefore, the  contractor owes the service employees in the plan who worked on the  contract during the month an additional $0.09 an hour for each hour  worked on the contract, payable on the next regular payday for wages.  Unless otherwise provided in the applicable wage determination,  contributions made by the employer for non-service employees may not be  credited toward meeting Service Contract Act fringe benefit obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees not enrolled in or excluded from participating in  fringe benefit plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Some health and welfare and pension plans  contain eligibility exclusions for certain employees. For example,  temporary and part-time employees may be excluded from participating in  such plans. Also, employees receiving benefits through participation in  plans of an employer other than the Government contractor or by a  spouse's employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the  contractor's plan because of prohibitions against ``double coverage''.  While such exclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide insurance  plan, employer contributions to such a plan cannot be considered to be  made on behalf of the excluded employees. Accordingly, under fringe  benefit determination requirements as described in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section, the employees excluded from participation in the health  insurance plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide fringe benefits or  be paid a cash equivalent payment during the period that they are not  eligible to participate in the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not required that all employees participating in a fringe  benefit plan be entitled to receive benefits from that plan at all  times. For example, under some plans, newly hired employees who are  eligible to participate in an insurance plan from their first day of  employment may be prohibited from receiving benefits from the plan  during a specified ``waiting period''. Contributions made on behalf of  such employees would serve to discharge the contractor's obligation to  furnish the fringe benefit. However, if no contributions are made for  such employees, no credit may be taken toward the contractor's fringe  benefit obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of health and welfare and pension benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Health  and welfare and/or pension payments to a ``bona fide'' insurance plan or  trust program may be made on a periodic payment basis which is not less  often than quarterly. However, where fringe benefit determinations  contemplate a fixed contribution on behalf of each employee, and a  contractor exercises his option to make hourly cash equivalent or  differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the  regular payday for wages. (See Sec. 4.165.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rules and regulations for furnishing health and welfare and  pension benefits to temporary and part-time employees are discussed in  Sec. 4.176.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rules and regulations for furnishing equivalent fringe  benefits or cash equivalents in lieu of health and welfare and pension  benefits are discussed in Sec. 4.177.</p>
