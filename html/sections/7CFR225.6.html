                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General responsibilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall provide  sufficient qualified consultative, technical, and managerial personnel  to administer the Program, monitor performance, and measure progress in  achieving Program goals. The State agency shall assign Program  responsibilities to personnel to ensure that all applicable requirements  under this part are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By February 1 of each fiscal year, each State agency shall  announce the purpose, eligibility criteria, and availability of the  Program throughout the State, through appropriate means of  communication. As part of this effort, each State agency shall identify  rural areas, Indian tribal territories, and areas with a concentration  of migrant farm workers which qualify for the Program and actively seek  eligible applicant sponsors to serve such areas. State agencies shall  identify priority outreach areas in accordance with FNS guidance and  target outreach efforts in these areas. State agencies shall identify  priority outreach areas in accordance with FNS guidance and target  outreach efforts in these areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each State agency shall require applicant sponsors submitting  Program application site information sheets, Program agreements, or a  request for advance payments, and sponsors submitting claims for  reimbursement to certify that the information submitted on these forms  is true and correct and that the sponsor is aware that deliberate  misrepresentation or withholding of information may result in  prosecution under applicable State and Federal statutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to the warnings specified in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section, State agencies may include the following information on  applications and pre-application materials distributed to prospective  sponsors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The criminal penalties and provisions established in section  12(g) of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1760(g)) that states  substantially: Whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or  obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject of  a grant or other form of assistance under this Act or the Child  Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.), whether received  directly or indirectly from the United States Department of Agriculture,  or whoever receives, conceals, or retains such funds, assets, or  property to personal use or gain, knowing such funds, assets, or  property have been embezzled, willfully misapplied, stolen, or obtained  by fraud shall, if such funds, assets, or property are of the value of  $100 or more, be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than  five years, or both, or, if such funds, assets, or property are of a  value of less than $100, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or  imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The procedures for termination from Program participation of  any site or sponsor which is determined to be seriously deficient in its  administration of the Program. In addition, the application may also  state that appeals of sponsor or site terminations will follow  procedures mandated by the State agency and will also meet the minimum  requirements of 7 CFR 225.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval of sponsor applications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each State agency must  inform all of the previous year's sponsors which meet current  eligibility requirements and all other potential sponsors of the  deadline date for submitting a written application for participation in  the Program. The State agency must require that all applicant sponsors  submit written applications for Program participation to the State  agency by June 15. However, the State agency may establish an earlier  deadline for the Program application submission. Sponsors applying for  participation in the Program due to an unanticipated school closure  during the period from October through April (or at any time of the year  in an area with a continuous school calendar) shall be exempt from the  application submission deadline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each State agency shall inform potential sponsors of the  procedure for applying for advance operating and administrative costs  payments as provided for in Sec. 225.9(c). Where applicable, each State  agency shall inform sponsors of the procedure for applying for start-up  payments provided for in Sec. 225.9(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 30 days of receiving a complete and correct application,  the State   agency shall notify the applicant of its approval or disapproval. If an  incomplete application is received, the State agency shall so notify the  applicant within 15 days and shall provide technical assistance for the  purpose of completing the application. Any disapproved applicant shall  be notified of its right to appeal under Sec. 225.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The State agency shall determine the eligibility of sponsors  applying for participation in the Program in accordance with the  applicant sponsor eligibility criteria outlined in Sec. 225.14. However,  State agencies may approve the application of an otherwise eligible  applicant sponsor which does not provide a year-round service to the  community which it proposes to serve under the Program only if it meets  one or more of the following criteria: It is a residential camp; it  proposes to provide a food service for the children of migrant workers;  a failure to do so would deny the Program to an area in which poor  economic conditions exist; a significant number of needy children will  not otherwise have reasonable access to the Program; or it proposes to  serve an area affected by an unanticipated school closure during the  period from October through April (or at any time of the year in an area  with a continuous school calendar). In addition, the State agency may  approve a sponsor for participation during an unanticipated school  closure without a prior application if the sponsor participated in the  program at any time during the current year or in either of the prior  two calendar years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The State agency must use the following priority system in  approving applicants to operate sites that propose to serve the same  area or the same enrolled children:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Public or nonprofit private school food authorities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public agencies and private nonprofit organizations that have  demonstrated successful program performance in a prior year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> New public agencies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> New private nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If two or more sponsors that qualify under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)  of this section apply to serve the same area, the State agency must  determine on a case-by-case basis which sponsor or sponsors it will  select to serve the needy children in the area. The State agency should  consider the resources and capabilities of each applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The State agency must not approve any sponsor to operate more  than 200 sites or to serve more than an average of 50,000 children per  day. However, the State agency may approve exceptions if the applicant  can demonstrate that it has the capability of managing a program larger  than these limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The State agency shall review each applicant's administrative  budget as a part of the application approval process in order to assess  the applicant's ability to operate in compliance with these regulations  within its projected reimbursement. In approving the applicant's  administrative budget, the State agency shall take into consideration  the number of sites and children to be served, as well as any other  relevant factors. A sponsor's administrative budget shall be subject to  review for adjustments by the State agency if the sponsor's level of  site participation or the number of meals served to children changes  significantly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Applicants which qualify as camps shall be approved for  reimbursement only for meals served free to enrolled children who meet  the Program's eligibility standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The State agency shall not approve the application of any  applicant sponsor identifiable through its organization or principals as  a sponsor which has been determined to be seriously deficient as  described in Sec. 225.11(c). However, the State agency may approve the  application of a sponsor which has been disapproved or terminated in  prior years in accordance with this paragraph if the applicant  demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State agency that it has taken  appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the  deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the sponsor's application to participate is denied, the  official making the determination of denial must notify the applicant  sponsor in writing stating all of the grounds on which the State agency  based the denial. Pending the outcome of a review of a denial, the   State agency shall proceed to approve other applicants in accordance  with its responsibilities under paragraph (b)(5) of this section,  without regard to the application under review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The State agency shall not approve the application of any  applicant sponsor which submits fraudulent information or documentation  when applying for Program participation or which knowingly withholds  information that may lead to the disapproval of its application.  Complete information regarding such disapproval of an applicant shall be  submitted by the State agency through FNSRO to OIG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of sponsor application--(1) Application forms. The  applicant shall submit a written application to the State agency for  participation in the Program as a sponsor. Sponsors proposing to serve  an area affected by an unanticipated school closure during the period  from October through April (or at any time of the year in an area with a  continuous school calendar) may be exempt, at the discretion of the  State agency, from submitting a new application if they have  participated in the program at any time during the current year or in  either of the prior two calendar years. The State agency may use the  application form developed by FNS, or it may develop an application  form, for use in the Program. Application shall be made on a timely  basis in accordance with the deadline date established under  Sec. 225.6(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for new sponsors, new sites, and, as determined by  the State agency, sponsors and sites which have experienced significant  operational problems in the prior year--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Site information sheets.

The State agency shall develop a procedure for establishing  initial maximum approved levels for sites when no accurate record from  prior years is available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum approved level shall be adjusted, if warranted,  based upon information collected during site reviews. If attendance at  the site on the day of the review is significantly below the site's  approved level, the State agency should consider making a downward  adjustment in the approved level with the objective of providing only  one meal per child.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sponsor may seek an upward adjustment in the approved  level for its sites by requesting a site review or by providing the  State agency with evidence that attendance exceeds the sites' approved  levels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whenever the State agency establishes or adjusts approved  levels of meal service for a site, it shall document the action in its  files, and it shall provide the sponsor with immediate   written confirmation of the approved level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Upon approval of its application or any adjustment to its  maximum approved levels, the sponsor shall inform the food service  management company with which it contracts of the approved level for  each meal service at each site served by the food service management  company.

Whenever the sponsor notifies the food service  management company of the approved levels or any adjustments to these  levels for any of its sites, the sponsor shall clearly inform the food  service management company that an approved level of meal service  represents the maximum number of meals which may be served at a site and  is not a standing order for a specific number of meals at that site.  When the number of children attending is below the site's approved  level, the sponsor shall adjust meal orders with the objective of  serving only one meal per child as required under Sec. 225.15(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State-Sponsor Agreement. A sponsor approved for participation in  the Program must enter into a permanent written agreement with the State  agency.
