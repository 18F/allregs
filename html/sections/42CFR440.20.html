                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Outpatient hospital services means preventive, diagnostic,  therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are furnished to outpatients;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are furnished by or under the direction of a physician or  dentist; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Are furnished by an institution that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is licensed or formally approved as a hospital by an officially  designated authority for State standard-setting; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Meets the requirements for participation in Medicare as a  hospital; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> May be limited by a Medicaid agency in the following manner: A  Medicaid agency may exclude from the definition of ``outpatient hospital  services'' those types of items and services that are not generally  furnished by most hospitals in the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rural health clinic services. If nurse practitioners or  physician assistants (as defined in Sec.  481.1 of this chapter) are not  prohibited by State law from furnishing primary health care, ``rural  health clinic services'' means the following services when furnished by  a rural health clinic that has been certified in accordance with part  491 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Services furnished by a physician within the scope of practice  of his profession under State law, if the physician performs the  services in the clinic or the services are furnished away from the  clinic and the physician has an agreement with the clinic providing that  he will be paid by it for such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Services furnished by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner,  nurse midwife or other specialized nurse practitioner (as defined in  Sec. Sec.  405.2401 and 491.2 of this chapter) if the services are  furnished in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.   405.2414(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Services and supplies that are furnished as an incident to  professional services furnished by a physician, physician assistant,  nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, or specialized nurse practitioner.  (See Sec. Sec.  405.2413 and 405.2415   of this chapter for the criteria for determining whether services and  supplies are included under this paragraph.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Part-time or intermittent visiting nurse care and related  medical supplies (other than drugs and biologicals) if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The clinic is located in an area in which the Secretary has  determined that there is a shortage of home health agencies (see Sec.   405.2417 of this chapter):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The services are furnished by a registered nurse or licensed  practical nurse or a licensed vocational nurse employed by, or otherwise  compensated for the services by, the clinic;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The services are furnished under a written plan of treatment  that is established and reviewed at least every 60 days by a supervising  physician of the clinic or that is established by a physician, physician  assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, or specialized nurse  practitioner and reviewed and approved at least every 60 days by a  supervising physician of the clinic; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The services are furnished to a homebound beneficiary. For  purposes of visiting nurse care, a ``homebound'' beneficiary means one  who is permanently or temporarily confined to his place of residence  because of a medical or health condition. He may be considered homebound  if he leaves the place of residence infrequently. For this purpose,  ``place of residence'' does not include a hospital or a skilled nursing  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other ambulatory services furnished by a rural health clinic. If  the State plan covers rural health clinic services, other ambulatory  services means ambulatory services other than rural health clinic  services, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, that are  otherwise included in the plan and meet specific State plan requirements  for furnishing those services. Other ambulatory services furnishd by a  rural health clinic are not subject to the physician supervision  requirements specified in Sec.  491.8(b) of this chapter, unless  required by State law or the State plan.
