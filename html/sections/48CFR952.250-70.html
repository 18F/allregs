The provisions of this clause shall not be limited in any way by, and shall be interpreted without reference to, any other clause of this contract, including the clause entitled Contract Disputes, provided, however, that this clause shall be subject to the clauses entitled Covenant Against Contingent Fees, and Accounts, records, and inspection, and any provisions that are later added to this contract as required by applicable Federal law, including statutes, executive orders and regulations, to be included in Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Civil penalties. The Contractor and its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to civil penalties, pursuant to 234A of the Act, for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety related rules, regulations, or orders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Criminal penalties.
