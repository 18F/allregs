a supplier (e.g., catalysts, activators, accelerators).</p><p class="depth0">Add-on control means an air pollution control device, such as a thermal oxidizer or carbon adsorber, that reduces pollution in an air stream by destruction or removal before discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Adhesive, adhesive coating means any chemical substance that is applied for the purpose of bonding two surfaces together. Products used on humans and animals, adhesive tape, contact paper, or any other product with an adhesive incorporated onto or in an inert substrate shall not be considered adhesives under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Assembled on-road vehicle coating means any coating operation in which coating is applied to the surface of some component or surface of a fully assembled motor vehicle or trailer intended for on-road use including, but not limited to, components or surfaces on automobiles and light-duty trucks that have been repaired after a collision or otherwise repainted, fleet delivery trucks, and motor homes and other recreational vehicles (including camping trailers and fifth wheels). Assembled on-road vehicle coating includes the concurrent coating of parts of the assembled on-road vehicle that are painted off-vehicle to protect systems, equipment, or to allow full coverage. Assembled on-road vehicle coating does not include surface coating operations that meet the applicability criteria of the Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP. Assembled on-road vehicle coating also does not include the use of adhesives, sealants, and caulks used in assembling on-road vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">Automotive lamp coating means any coating operation in which coating is applied to the surface of some component of the body of an exterior automotive lamp, including the application of reflective argent coatings and clear topcoats.

Decorative, protective, or functional materials that consist only of protective oils for metal, acids, bases, or any combination of these substances, or paper film or plastic film which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the film manufacturer, are not considered coatings for the purposes of this subpart. A liquid plastic coating means a coating made from fine particle-size polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in solution (also referred to as a plastisol).</p><p class="depth0">Coating operation means equipment used to apply cleaning materials to a substrate to prepare it for coating application (surface preparation) or to remove dried coating; to apply coating to a substrate (coating application) and to dry or cure the coating after application; or to clean coating operation

equipment (equipment cleaning). A single coating operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a given quantity of coating or cleaning material is applied to a given part and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP are emitted from the specific quantity of coating or cleaning material on the specific part. There may be multiple coating operations in an affected source. Coating application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, or marking pens is not a coating operation for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Coatings solids means the nonvolatile portion of the coating that makes up the dry film.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this subpart, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of coating operation, or capture system, or add-on control device parameters.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled coating operation means a coating operation from which some or all of the organic HAP emissions are routed through an emission capture system and add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including but not limited to, any emission limit or operating limit or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limit, or operating limit, or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means the aggregate of all requirements associated with a compliance option including emission limit, operating limit, work practice standard, etc.</p><p class="depth0">Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a source of emissions and captures and directs the emissions to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Exempt compound means a specific compound that is not considered a VOC due to negligible photochemical reactivity. The exempt compounds are listed in 40 CFR 51.100(s).</p><p class="depth0">Facility maintenance means the routine repair or renovation (including the surface coating) of the tools, equipment, machinery, and structures that comprise the infrastructure of the affected facility and that are necessary for the facility to function in its intended capacity.</p><p class="depth0">General use coating means any coating operation that is not an automotive lamp, TPO, or assembled on-road vehicle coating operation.</p><p class="depth0">Hobby shop means any surface coating operation, located at an affected source, that is used exclusively for personal, noncommercial purposes by the affected source's employees or assigned personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer's formulation data means data on a material (such as a coating) that are supplied by the material manufacturer based on knowledge of the ingredients used to manufacture that material, rather than based on testing of the material with the test methods specified in Sec. 63.4541. Manufacturer's formulation data may include, but are not limited to, information on density, organic HAP content, volatile organic matter content, and coating solids content.</p><p class="depth0">Mass fraction of coating solids means the ratio of the mass of solids (also known as the mass of nonvolatiles) to the mass of a coating in which it is contained; kg of coating solids per kg of coating.</p><p class="depth0">Mass fraction of organic HAP means the ratio of the mass of organic HAP to the mass of a material in which it is contained, expressed as kg of organic HAP per kg of material.</p><p class="depth0">Month means a calendar month or a pre-specified period of 28 days to 35 days to allow for flexibility in recordkeeping when data are based on a business accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">Non-HAP coating means, for the purposes of this subpart, a coating that contains no more than 0.1 percent by mass of any individual organic HAP that is an OSHA-defined carcinogen as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and no more than 1.0 percent by mass for any other individual HAP.</p><p class="depth0">Organic HAP content means the mass of organic HAP emitted per mass of coating solids used for a coating calculated using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4541. The organic HAP content is determined for the coating in the condition it is in when received from its manufacturer or supplier and does not account for any alteration after receipt. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, organic HAP content is the mass of organic HAP that is emitted, rather than the organic HAP content of the coating as it is received.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent total enclosure (PTE) means a permanently installed enclosure that meets the criteria of Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51, for a PTE and that directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Personal watercraft means a vessel (boat) which uses an inboard motor powering a water jet pump as its primary source of motive power and which is designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel, rather than in the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside the vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Plastic part and product means any piece or combination of pieces of which at least one has been formed from one or more resins.

Appendix A to Subpart PPPP of Part 63--Determination of Weight</p><p class="depth0">Volatile Matter Content and Weight Solids Content of Reactive Adhesives</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Applicability and Principle</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability: This method applies to the determination of weight volatile matter content and weight solids content for most one-part or multiple-part reactive adhesives. Reactive adhesives are composed, in large part, of monomers that react during the adhesive curing reaction, and, as a result, do not volatilize. The monomers become integral parts of the cured adhesive through chemical reaction. At least 70 weight percent of the system, excluding water and non-volatile solids such as fillers, react during the process. This method is not appropriate for cyanoacrylates. For cyanoacrylates, South Coast Air Quality Management District Test Method 316B should be used. This method is not appropriate for one-part moisture cure urethane adhesives or for silicone adhesives. For one-part moisture cure urethane adhesives and for silicone adhesives, EPA Method 24 should be used.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Principle: One-part and multiple-part reactive adhesives undergo a reactive conversion from liquid to solid during the application and assembly process. Reactive adhesives are applied to a single surface, but then are usually quickly covered with another mating surface to achieve a bonded assembly. The monomers employed in such systems typically react and are converted to non-volatile solids. If left uncovered, as in a Method 24 (ASTM D2369) test, the reaction is inhibited by the presence of oxygen and volatile loss of the reactive components competes more heavily with the cure reaction. If this were to happen under normal use conditions, the adhesives would not provide adequate performance. This method minimizes this undesirable deterioration of the adhesive performance.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Materials and Apparatus</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Aluminum foil, aluminum sheet, non-leaching plastic film or non-leaching plastic sheet, approximately 3 inches by 3 inches.
