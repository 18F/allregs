A portable water car shall be capable of providing a flow through the hose of 50 gallons of water per minute at a nozzle pressure of 50 pounds per square inch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A portable chemical car shall carry enough chemicals to provide a

fire extinguishing capacity equivalent to that of a portable water car.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Portable foam-generating machines or devices: A portable foam-generating machine or device shall have facilities and equipment for supplying the machine with 30 gallons of water per minute at 30 pounds per square inch for a period of 35 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Portable fire extinguisher: A portable fire extinguisher shall be either (1) a multipurpose dry chemical type containing a nominal weight of 5 pounds of dry powder and enough expellant to apply the powder or (2) a foam-producing type containing at least 2\1/2\ gallons of foam-producing liquids and enough expellant to supply the foam. Only fire extinguishers approved by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., or Factory Mutual Research Corp., carrying appropriate labels as to type and purpose, shall be used. After March 30, 1971, all new portable fire extinguishers acquired for use in a coal mine shall have a 2A 10 BC or higher rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the fire hose shall be lined with a material having flame resistant qualities meeting requirements for hose in Bureau of Mines' Schedule 2G. The cover shall be polyester, or other material with flame-spread qualities and mildew resistance equal or superior to polyester. The bursting pressure shall be at least 4 times the water pressure at the valve to the hose inlet with the valve closed; the maximum water pressure in the hose nozzle shall not exceed 100 p.s.i.g.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the fire hose shall be lined with a material having flame resistant qualities meeting requirements for hose in Bureau of Mines' Schedule 2G.

The bursting pressure shall be at least 4 times the water pressure at the valve to the hose inlet with the valve closed; the maximum water pressure in the hose nozzle shall not exceed 100 p.s.i.g.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire hose installed for use in underground coal mines prior to December 30, 1970, shall be mildew-proof and have a bursting pressure at least 4 times the water pressure at the valve to the hose inlet with the valve closed, and the maximum water pressure in the hose nozzle with water flowing shall not exceed 100 p.s.i.g.


Sec. 75.1100-2  Quantity and location of firefighting equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Working sections. (1) Each working section of coal mines producing 300 tons or more per shift shall be provided with two portable fire extinguishers and 240 pounds of rock dust in bags or other suitable containers; waterlines shall extend to each section loading point and be equipped with enough fire hose to reach each working face unless the section loading point is provided with one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two portable water cars; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Two portable chemical cars; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> One portable water car or one portable chemical car, and either (a) a portable foam-generating machine or (b) a portable high-pressure rock-dusting machine fitted with at least 250 feet of hose and supplied with at least 60 sacks of rock dust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each working section of coal mines producing less than 300 tons of coal per shift shall be provided with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two portable fire extinguishers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 240 pounds of rock dust in bags or other suitable containers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least 500 gallons of water and at least three pails of 10-quart capacity; or a waterline with sufficient hose to reach the working places; or a portable water car of at least 500-gallons capacity; or a portable, all-purpose, dry-powder chemical car of at least 125-pounds capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each working section with no electrical equipment at the face of an anthracite coal mine producing less than 300 tons of coal per shift shall be provided with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Portable fire extinguishers containing a total capacity of at least 30 pounds of dry chemical or 15 gallons of foam and located at the entrance to the gangway at the bottom of the slope; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Portable fire extinguishers containing a total capacity of at least 20 pounds of dry chemical or 10 gallons of foam and located within 500 feet from the working face.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Belt conveyors. In all coal mines, waterlines shall be installed parallel to the entire length of belt conveyors and shall be equipped with firehose outlets with valves at 300-foot intervals along each belt conveyor and at tailpieces. At least 500 feet of firehose with fittings suitable for connection with each belt conveyor waterline system shall be stored at strategic locations along the belt conveyor. Waterlines may be
