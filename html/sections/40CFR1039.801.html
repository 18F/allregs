This includes, but is not limited to, parameters related to injection timing and fueling rate. You may ask us to exclude a parameter that is difficult to access if it cannot be adjusted to affect emissions without significantly degrading engine performance, or if you otherwise show us that it will not be adjusted in a way that affects emissions during in-use operation.</p><p class="depth0">Aftertreatment means relating to a catalytic converter, particulate filter, or any other system, component, or technology mounted downstream of the exhaust valve (or exhaust port) whose design function is to decrease emissions in the engine exhaust before it is exhausted to the environment.

For example, we would consider nonroad equipment that is certain to be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module to be emergency equipment, irrespective of the equipment manufacturer's original design. In making this determination, we may

consider any factor that has an effect on the totality of the actual risk to human life. For example, we may consider how frequently the equipment will be used in emergency situations or how likely it is that the emission controls will cause a significant risk to human life when the equipment is used in emergency situations. We will consider to what extent the flexibility provisions of Sec.  1039.665 already address the risk. In the example above, we would not consider equipment to be emergency equipment if there is merely a possibility (rather than a certainty) that the equipment will be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module.</p><p class="depth0">Emission-control system means any device, system, or element of design that controls or reduces the emissions of regulated pollutants from an engine.</p><p class="depth0">Emission-data engine means an engine that is tested for certification.

The use of valve timing to increase the amount of residual exhaust gas in the combustion chamber(s) that is mixed with incoming air before or during combustion is not considered exhaust-gas recirculation for the purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Family emission limit (FEL) means an emission level declared by the manufacturer to serve in place of an otherwise applicable emission standard under the ABT program in subpart H of this part. The family emission limit must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard it replaces.
