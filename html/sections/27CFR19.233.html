                            <p class="depth0">When the proprietor is required to prepay the tax prior to  withdrawal of spirits from the bonded premises, the proprietor must  prepay the tax with a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return,  and include the remittance with the return. The proprietor may prepay  tax for one or more withdrawals with a single prepayment return on TTB F  5000.24. The proprietor will note the serial number of the TTB F  5000.24, and the date and time of the prepayment on the individual  record of tax determination. The proprietor may not remove spirits from  the bonded premises until the tax has been paid.  (26 U.S.C. 5061)</p>
