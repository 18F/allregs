Within the meaning of this section, a  practitioner represents conflicting interest, when on behalf of one  client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client  requires him to oppose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The obligation to represent the client with undivided fidelity  and not to divulge secrets or confidence forbids also the subsequent  acceptance of retainers or employment from others in matters adversely  affecting any interest of the client with respect to which confidence  has been reposed.</p>
