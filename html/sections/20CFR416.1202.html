                                Sec. 416.1202  Deeming of resources.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Married individual. In the case of an individual who is living  with a person not eligible under this part and who is considered to be  the husband or wife of such individual under the criteria in  Secs. 416.1802 through 416.1835 of this part, such individual's  resources shall be deemed to include any resources, not otherwise  excluded under this subpart, of such spouse whether or not such  resources are available to such individual. In addition to the  exclusions listed in Sec. 416.1210, we also exclude the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pension funds that the ineligible spouse may have. Pension funds  are defined as funds held in individual retirement accounts (IRA), as  described by the Internal Revenue Code, or in work-related pension plans  (including such plans for self-employed persons, sometimes referred to  as Keogh plans);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of  receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of special pay  an ineligible spouse received from one of the uniformed services  pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of  receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of family  separation allowance an ineligible spouse received from one of the  uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 427 as a result of deployment  to or service in a combat zone (as defined in Sec. 416.1160(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Child--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In the case of a child (as defined in  Sec. 416.1856) who is under age 18, we will deem to that child any  resources, not otherwise excluded under this subpart, of his or her  ineligible parent who is living in the same household with him or her  (as described in Sec. 416.1851). We also will deem to the child the  resources of his or her ineligible stepparent. As used in this section,  the term ``parent'' means the natural or adoptive parent of a child, and  the term ``stepparent'' means the spouse (as defined in Sec. 416.1806)  of such natural or adoptive parent who is living in the same household  with the child and parent. We will deem to a child the resources of his  or her parent and stepparent whether or not those resources are  available to him or her. We will deem to a child the resources of his or  her parent and stepparent only to the extent that those resources exceed  the resource limits described in Sec. 416.1205. (If the child is living  with only one parent, we apply the resource limit for an individual. If  the child is living with both parents, or the child is living with one  parent and a stepparent, we apply the resource limit for an individual  and spouse.) We will not deem to a child the resources of his or her  parent or stepparent if the child is excepted from deeming under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition to the exclusions listed  in Sec. 416.1210, we also exclude the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pension funds of an ineligible parent (or stepparent). Pension  funds are defined as funds held in IRAs, as described by the Internal  Revenue Code, or in work-related pension plans (including such plans for  self-employed persons, sometimes referred to as Keogh plans);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of  receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of special pay  an ineligible parent (or stepparent) received from one of the uniformed  services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For 9 months beginning with the month following the month of  receipt, the unspent portion of any retroactive payment of family  separation allowance an ineligible parent (or stepparent) received from  one of the uniformed services pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 427 as a result of  deployment to or service in a combat zone (as defined in  Sec. 416.1160(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disabled child under age 18. In the case of a disabled child  under age 18 who is living in the same household with his or her  parents, the deeming provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section  shall not apply if such child--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Previously received a reduced SSI benefit while a resident of a  medical treatment facility, as described in Sec. 416.414;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is eligible for medical assistance under a Medicaid State home  care plan approved by the Secretary under the provisions of section  1915(c) or authorized under section 1902(e)(3) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would otherwise be ineligible because of the deeming of his or  her parents' resources or income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. When used in this subpart L, the term individual  refers to an eligible aged, blind, or disabled person, and also includes  a person whose resources are deemed to be the resources of such  individual (as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section).
