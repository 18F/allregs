                                Sec. 284.8  Release of firm capacity on interstate pipelines.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a  firm basis under subpart B or G of this part must include in its tariff  a mechanism for firm shippers to release firm capacity to the pipeline  for resale by the pipeline on a firm basis under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Firm shippers must be permitted to release their capacity, in  whole or in part, on a permanent or short-term basis, without  restriction on the terms or conditions of the release. A firm shipper  may arrange for a replacement shipper to obtain its released capacity  from the pipeline. A replacement shipper is any shipper that obtains  released capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate charged the replacement shipper for a release of  capacity may not exceed the applicable maximum rate, except that no rate  limitation applies to the release of capacity for a period of one year  or less if the release is to take effect on or before one year from the  date on which the pipeline is notified of the release. Payments or other  consideration exchanged between the releasing and replacement shippers  in a release to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this  section are not subject to the maximum rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a firm  shipper that wants to release any or all of its firm capacity must  notify the pipeline of the terms and conditions under which the shipper  will release its capacity. The firm shipper must also notify the  pipeline of any replacement shipper designated to obtain the released  capacity under the terms and conditions specified by the firm shipper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The pipeline must provide notice of offers to release or to  purchase capacity, the terms and conditions of such offers, and the name  of any replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section,  on an Internet web site, for a reasonable period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person  offering the highest rate and offering to meet any other terms and  conditions of the release. If more than one person offers the highest  rate and meets the terms and conditions of the release, the released  capacity may be allocated on a   basis provided in the pipeline's tariff, provided however, if the  replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section offers  the highest rate, the capacity must be allocated to the designated  replacement shipper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless otherwise agreed by the pipeline, the contract of the  shipper releasing capacity will remain in full force and effect, with  the net proceeds from any resale to a replacement shipper credited to  the releasing shipper's reservation charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To the extent necessary, a firm shipper on an interstate  pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under  subpart B or G of this part is granted a limited-jurisdiction blanket  certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 7 of  the Natural Gas Act solely for the purpose of releasing firm capacity  pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following releases need not comply with the bidding  requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A release of capacity to an asset manager as defined in  paragraph (h)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A release of capacity to a marketer participating in a state- regulated retail access program as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A release for more than one year at the maximum tariff rate;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A release for any period of 31 days or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a release is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1) of  this section, notice of the release must be provided on the pipeline's  Internet Web site as soon as possible, but not later than the first  nomination, after the release transaction commences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a release of capacity is exempt from bidding under  paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, a firm shipper may not roll over,  extend or in any way continue the release to the same replacement  shipper using the 31 days or less bidding exemption until 28 days after  the first release period has ended. The 28-day hiatus does not apply to  any re-release to the same replacement shipper that is posted for  bidding or that qualifies for any of the other exemptions from bidding  in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the capacity release is for a period of one year or less, the  asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day  during a minimum period of the lesser of five months (or 155 days) or  the term of the release.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the capacity release is for a period of more than one year,  the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any  day during a minimum period of five months (or 155 days) of each twelve- month period of the release, and on five-twelfths of the days of any  additional period of the release not equal to twelve months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the capacity release is a release of storage capacity, the  asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation need only be up to 100  percent of the daily contract demand under the release for storage  withdrawals or injections, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A release to a marketer participating in a state-regulated  retail access program exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph  (h)(1)(ii) of this section is any prearranged capacity release that will  be utilized by the replacement shipper to provide the gas supply  requirement of retail consumers pursuant to a retail access program  approved by the state agency with jurisdiction over the local  distribution company that provides delivery service to such retail  consumers.
