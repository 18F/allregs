                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual may request that the Food and Drug Administration  notify him whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about  him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal  identifier. An individual may at the same time, or after receiving  notification that such a record about him exists, requests that he be  given access to the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An individual desiring notification or access to records shall  mail or deliver a request for records in any Food and Drug  Administration Privacy Act Records System to the FDA Privacy Act  Coordinator (address is located on the agency web site at http:// www.gov.fda).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests shall be in writing and shall name the Privacy Act  Record System or Systems concerning which the individual requests  notification of whether there are records about him that are retrieved  by reference to his name or other personal identifier. To help assure a  prompt response, an individual should indicate that he is making a  ``Privacy Act Request'' on the envelope and in a prominent manner in the  letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An individual who merely wishes to be notified whether a Privacy  Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not  provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere  fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an  individual in any of its Privacy Act Records Systems would not be likely  to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Where  mere disclosure of the fact that a record about the individual exists  would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, further  verification of the identity of the individual shall be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An individual who requests that he be given access to a copy of  records about himself, if any exist, should indicate whether he prefers  (1) to have copies of any such records mailed to him in accordance with  Sec. 21.43(a)(1), which may involve a fee under Sec. 21.45, including  information to verify his identity under Sec. 21.44 or (2) to use the  procedures for access in person under Sec. 21.43(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A request for notification and access may be submitted under  this subpart concerning any Privacy Act Record System that is exempt  under Sec. 21.61, as indicated in the notice for the system. An  individual seeking access to records under Sec. 21.65(b)(2) to  investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes other than  criminal law enforcement purposes should submit a description of the  right, benefit, or privilege that he believes he was denied as the  result of the Food and Drug Administration's maintenance of the records.  Where the system is exempt under Sec. 21.61, and access to the  requested records is not granted under Sec. 21.65, the request shall be  handled under the provisions of part 20 of this chapter (the public  information regulations).
