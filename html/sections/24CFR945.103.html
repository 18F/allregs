They also may utilize housing resources for which they plan to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan, and that they have a reasonable expectation of obtaining. PHAs also may utilize, to the extent practicable, any housing facilities that they own or control in which supportive services are already provided, facilitated or coordinated, such as mixed housing, shared housing, family housing, group homes, and congregate housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exemption of mixed population projects.
