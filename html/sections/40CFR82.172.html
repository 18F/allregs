Chemical  identity is always part of a health and safety study. Information which  arises as a result of a formal, disciplined study is included in the  definition. Also included is information relating to the effects of a  substitute or its components on health or the environment. Any available  data that bear on the effects of a substitute or its components on  health or the environment would be included. Examples include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Long- and short-term tests of mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or  teratogenicity; data on behavioral disorders; dermatoxicity;  pharmacological effects; mammalian absorption, distribution, metabolism,  and excretion; cumulative, additive, and synergistic effects; acute,  subchronic, and chronic effects; and structure/activity analyses;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Tests for ecological or other environmental effects on  invertebrates, fish, or other animals, and plants, including: Acute  toxicity tests, chronic toxicity tests, critical life stage tests,  behavioral tests, algal growth tests, seed germination tests, microbial  function tests, bioconcentration or bioaccumulation tests, and model  ecosystem (microcosm) studies;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Assessments of human and environmental exposure, including  workplace exposure, and effects of a particular substitute on the  environment, including surveys, tests, and studies of:   Biological, photochemical, and chemical degradation; air, water and soil  transport; biomagnification and bioconcentration; and chemical and  physical properties, e.g., atmospheric lifetime, boiling point, vapor  pressure, evaporation rates from soil and water, octanol/water partition  coefficient, and water solubility;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring data, when they have been aggregated and analyzed to  measure the exposure of humans or the environment to a substitute; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Any assessments of risk to health or the environment resulting  from the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or  disposal of the substitute or its components.</p><p class="depth0">Importer means any person who imports a chemical substitute into the  United States. Importer includes the person primarily liable for the  payment of any duties on the merchandise or an authorized agent acting  on his or her behalf. The term also includes, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The consignee;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The importer of record;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The actual owner; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The transferee, if the right to draw merchandise in a bonded  warehouse has been transferred.</p><p class="depth2">Major Industrial Use Sector or Sector means an industrial category  which EPA has reviewed under the SNAP program with historically high  consumption patterns of ozone-depleting substances, including:  Refrigeration and air conditioning; foam-blowing; fire suppression and  explosion protection; solvents cleaning; aerosols; sterilants; tobacco  expansion; pesticides; and adhesives, coatings and inks sectors.</p><p class="depth2">Manufacturer means any person engaged in the direct manufacture of a  substitute.</p><p class="depth2">Mixture means any mixture or blend of two or more compounds.</p><p class="depth2">Person includes an individual, corporation, partnership,  association, state, municipality, political subdivision of a state, and  any agency, department, or instrumentality of the United States and any  officer, agent, or employee of such entities.</p><p class="depth2">Pesticide has the meaning contained in the Federal Insecticide,  Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. and the regulations  issued under it.</p><p class="depth2">Potentially available is defined as any alternative for which  adequate health, safety, and environmental data, as required for the  SNAP notification process, exist to make a determination of  acceptability, and which the Agency reasonably believes to be  technically feasible, even if not all testing has yet been completed and  the alternative is not yet produced or sold.</p><p class="depth2">Premanufacture Notice (PMN) Program has the meaning described in 40  CFR part 720, subpart A promulgated under the Toxic Substances Control  Act, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.</p><p class="depth2">Producer means any person who manufactures, formulates or otherwise  creates a substitute in its final form for distribution or use in  interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth2">Research and development means quantities of a substitute  manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured,  imported, or processed solely for research and development.</p><p class="depth2">Residential use means use by a private individual of a chemical  substance or any product containing the chemical substance in or around  a permanent or temporary household, during recreation, or for any  personal use or enjoyment.
