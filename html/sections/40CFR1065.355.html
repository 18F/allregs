                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. If you measure CO using an NDIR analyzer,  verify the amount of H2O and CO2 interference  after initial analyzer installation and after major maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement principles. H2O and CO2 can  positively interfere with an NDIR analyzer by causing a response similar  to CO. If the NDIR analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize  measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification,  simultaneously conduct these other measurements to test the compensation  algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System requirements. A CO NDIR analyzer must have combined  H2O and CO2 interference that is within 2 % of the flow-weighted mean concentration of CO  expected at the standard, though we strongly recommend a lower  interference that is within 1%.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure. Perform the interference verification as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Start, operate, zero, and span the CO NDIR analyzer as you would  before an emission test. If the sample is passed through a dryer during  emission testing, you may run this verification test with the dryer if  it meets the requirements of Sec.  1065.342. Operate the dryer at the  same conditions as you will for an emission test. You may also run this  verification test without the sample dryer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for that dryer. Use a CO2  span gas concentration at least as high as the maximum expected during  testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Introduce the humidified CO2 test gas into the sample  system. You may introduce it downstream of any sample dryer, if one is  used during testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the sample is not passed through a dryer during this  verification test, measure the H2O mole fraction,  xH2O, of the humidified CO2 test gas as close as  possible to the inlet of the analyzer. For example, measure dewpoint,  Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, to calculate  xH2O. Verify that the H2O content meets  the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the sample is  passed through a dryer during this verification test, you must verify  that the H2O content of the humidified test gas downstream of  the vessel meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section  based on either direct measurement of the H2O content (e.g.,  dewpoint and pressure) or an estimate based on the vessel pressure and  temperature. Use good engineering judgment to estimate the  H2O content. For example, you may use previous direct  measurements of H2O content to verify the vessel's level of  saturation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a sample dryer is not used in this verification test, use  good engineering judgment to prevent condensation in the transfer lines,  fittings, or valves from the point where xH2O is measured to  the analyzer. We recommend that you design your system so that the wall  temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the point  where xH2O is measured to the analyzer are at least 5 [deg]C  above the local sample gas dewpoint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Allow time for the analyzer response to stabilize. Stabilization  time may include time to purge the transfer line and to account for  analyzer response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> While the analyzer measures the sample's concentration, record  its output for 30 seconds. Calculate the arithmetic mean of this data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The analyzer meets the interference verification if the result  of paragraph (d)(7) of this section meets the tolerance in paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> You may also run interference procedures for CO2 and  H2O separately. If the CO2 and H2O  levels used are higher than the maximum levels expected during testing,  you may scale down each observed interference value by multiplying the  observed interference by the ratio of the maximum expected concentration  value to the actual value used during this procedure. You may run  separate interference concentrations of H2O (down to 0.025  mol/mol H2O content) that are lower than the maximum levels  expected during testing, but you must scale up the observed  H2O interference by multiplying the observed interference by  the ratio of the maximum expected H2O concentration value to  the actual value used during this procedure. The sum of the two scaled  interference values must meet the tolerance in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions. The following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may omit this verification if you can show by engineering  analysis that for your CO sampling system and your emission-calculation  procedures, the combined CO2 and H2O interference  for your CO NDIR analyzer always affects your brake-specific CO emission  results within 0.5% of the applicable CO standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may use a CO NDIR analyzer that you determine does not meet  this verification, as long as you try to correct the problem and the  measurement deficiency does not adversely affect your ability to show  that engines comply with all applicable emission standards.
