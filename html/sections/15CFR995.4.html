                            <p class="depth0">Certified NOAA ENC Distributor (CED) means an entity that is certified as a distributor of NOAA ENC files by NOAA. This certification indicates that the distributor meets certain requirements (in Subparts A, B, and D of this part) that ensure timely and accurate dissemination of NOAA ENC data.</p><p class="depth0">Certified NOAA ENC Value Added Distributor (CEVAD) means an entity that creates a derived product that has been produced from NOAA ENC files using a process certified by NOAA. This certification indicates that the CEVAD meets certain requirements (in Subparts A, C, and D of this part) that ensure timely and accurate dissemination of NOAA ENC data in a non-ENC format.</p><p class="depth0">Derived product means a navigational product produced by transforming the NOAA ENC files to another format while preserving the content and accuracy. It may contain information from other sources.</p><p class="depth0">Distributor means a person or company that redistributes a NOAA ENC to end users in its original format.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) means the internationally adopted computer-assisted navigation system which, when complying with all of the required specifications, can be accepted as the up-to-date chart required by V/20 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) means a database, standardized as to content, structure, and format, issued for use with ECDIS on the authority of government authorized hydrographic offices. The ENC contains all the chart information necessary for safe navigation and may contain supplementary information in addition to that contained in the paper chart (e.g., sailing directions), which may be considered necessary for safe navigation.</p><p class="depth0">Entity means one person, one person within a company, or one company.</p><p class="depth0">NOAA ENC [supreg] means Electronic Navigational Charts produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA ENC files comply with the IHO S-57 standard, Edition 3.1 and the ENC Product Specification. The phrase ``NOAA ENC'' is a registered trademark and may not be used without permission.</p><p class="depth0">Redistributed means to distribute again, either as a direct copy or in a different way. A redistributed NOAA ENC is one that has been downloaded from an official NOAA ENC Web site by one entity and provided to another entity.</p><p class="depth0">System Electronic Navigational Chart (SENC) means a database resulting from the transformation of the ENC by ECDIS for appropriate use, updates to the ENC by appropriate means and other data added by the mariner. It is this database that is actually accessed by ECDIS for the display generation and other navigational functions, and is equivalent to an up-to-date paper chart. The SENC may also contain information from other sources.</p><p class="depth0">Value Added Distributor means a person or company that redistributes a NOAA ENC with additional data included or in a different format to create newly derived products used by end users.</p>
