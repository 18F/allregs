                                Sec. 1.306-3  Section 306 stock defined.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of subchapter C, chapter 1 of the code, the term  section 306 stock means stock which meets the requirements of section  306(c)(1). Any class of stock distributed to a shareholder in a  transaction in which no amount is includible in the income of the  shareholder or no gain or loss is recognized may be section 306 stock,  if a distribution of money by the distributing corporation in lieu of  such stock would have been a dividend in whole or in part. However,  except as provided in section 306(g), if no part of a distribution of  money by the distributing corporation in lieu of such stock would have  been a dividend, the stock distributed will not constitute section 306  stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>,  the proceeds received from the disposition shall be treated as ordinary  income to the extent that the fair market value of the stock rights, on  the date distributed to the shareholder, would have been a dividend to  the shareholder had the distributing corporation distributed cash in  lieu of stock rights. Any excess of the amount realized over the sum of  the amount treated as ordinary income plus the adjusted basis of the  stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale of the stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(A)</em> provides that section 306 stock is any  stock (other than common issued with respect to common) distributed to  the shareholder selling or otherwise disposing thereof if, under section  305(a) (relating to distributions of stock and stock rights) any part of  the distribution was not included in the gross income of the  distributee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. The application of the  preceding sentence is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation A, having only common stock outstanding, is  merged in a statutory merger (qualifying as a reorganization under  section 368(a)) with Corporation B. Pursuant to such merger, the  shareholders of Corporation A received both common and preferred stock  in Corporation B. The preferred stock received by such shareholders is  section 306 stock.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. X and Y each own one-half of the 2,000 outstanding shares  of preferred stock and one-half of the 2,000 outstanding shares of  common stock of Corporation C. Pursuant to a reorganization within the  meaning of section 368(a)(1)(E) (recapitalization) each shareholder  exchanges his preferred stock for preferred stock of a new issue which  is not substantially different from the preferred stock previously held.  Unless the preferred stock exchanged was itself section 306 stock the  preferred stock received is not section 306 stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 306(c)(1)(C) includes in the definition of section 306  stock any stock (except as provided in section 306(c)(1)(B)) the basis  of which in the hands of the person disposing of such stock, is  determined by reference to section 306 stock held by such shareholder or  any other person. Under this paragraph common stock can be section 306  stock. Thus, if a person owning section 306 stock in Corporation A  transfers it to Corporation B which is controlled by him in exchange for  common stock of Corporation B in a transaction to which section 351 is  applicable, the common stock so received by him would be section 306  stock and subject to the provisions of section 306(a) on its  disposition. In addition, the section 306 stock transferred is section  306 stock in the hands of Corporation B, the transferee. Section 306  stock transferred by gift remains section 306 stock in the hands of the  donee. Stock received in exchange for section 306 stock under section  1036(a) (relating to exchange of stock for stock in the same  corporation) or under so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section  1036(a) becomes section 306 stock and acquires, for purposes of section  306, the characteristics of the section 306 stock exchanged. The entire  amount of the fair market value of the other property received in such  transaction shall be considered as received upon a disposition (other  than a redemption) to which section 306(a) applies. Section 306 stock  ceases to be so classified if the basis of such stock is determined by  reference to its fair market value on the date of the decedent- stockholder's death or the optional valuation date under section 1014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If section 306 stock which was distributed with respect to  common stock is exchanged for common stock in the same corporation  (whether or not such exchange is pursuant to a conversion privilege  contained in section 306 stock), such common stock shall not be section  306 stock. This paragraph applies to exchanges not coming within the  purview of section 306(c)(1)(B). Common stock which is convertible into  stock other than common stock or into property, shall not be considered  common stock. It is immaterial whether the conversion privilege is  contained in the stock or in some type of collateral agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If there is a substantial change in the terms and conditions of  any stock, then, for the purpose of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fair market value of such stock shall be the fair market  value at the time of distribution or the fair market value at the time  of such change, whichever is higher;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such stock's ratable share of the amount which would have been a  dividend if money had been distributed in lieu of stock shall be  determined by reference to the time of distribution or by reference to  the time of such change, whichever ratable share is higher; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 306(c)(2) shall be inapplicable if there would have been  a dividend to any extent if money had been distributed in lieu of the  stock either at the time of the distribution or at the time of such  change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When section 306 stock is disposed of, the amount treated under  section 306(a)(1)(A) as ordinary income, for the purposes of part I,  subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, be treated as derived from the same  source as would have been the source if money had been received from the  corporation as a dividend at the time of the distribution of such stock.  If the amount is determined to be derived from sources within the United  States, the amount shall be considered to be fixed or determinable  annual or periodic gains, profits, and income within the meaning of  section 871(a) or section 881(a), relating, respectively, to the tax on  nonresident alien individuals and on foreign corporations not engaged in  business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 306 shall be inapplicable to stock received before June  22, 1954, and to stock received on or after June 22, 1954, in  transactions subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of  1939.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11607, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7281, 38 FR  18540, July 12, 1973; T.D. 7556, 43 FR 34128, Aug. 3, 1978]</p>
