                            <p class="depth0">You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You may include both

controlled and uncontrolled coating operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option for any coating operation(s) in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090 and the work practice standards required in Sec. 63.4093; and each controlled coating operation must meet the operating limits required in Sec. 63.4092. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 63.4160(b)(4) and except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to the requirements of Sec. 63.4161(h), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4092, using the procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4167 and 63.4168.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plan required by Sec. 63.4093 during the initial compliance period as specified in Sec. 63.4130.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You must follow the procedures in paragraphs (d) through (l) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4090.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, volume used, and volume fraction of coating solids. Follow the procedures specified in Sec. 63.4151(a) through (d) to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during the compliance period, and the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during the compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls. Using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4151, calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls from all coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the compliance period in the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation. Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during the compliance period. The emissions reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emissions reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Calculate the organic HAP emissions reduction for controlled coating operations not using liquid-liquid material balance. For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate organic HAP emissions reduction, using Equation 1 of this section, by applying the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the

coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period. For any period of time a deviation specified in Sec. 63.4163(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled coating operation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation. You must not include those materials in the calculations of organic HAP emissions reduction in Equation 1 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY02.006
