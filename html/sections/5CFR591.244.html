                                Sec. 591.244  How does OPM select COLA Advisory Committee members?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In establishing a COLA Advisory Committee, OPM invites local  agencies and employee organizations to nominate committee members. OPM  also invites COLA Defense Corporations and the local Federal Executive  Board or Federal Executive Association each to nominate committee  members. Subject to Sec. 591.243, OPM selects committee members from  these nominations in a manner designed to achieve a balanced  representation that is reflective of agencies and employee organizations  in the area. In consultation with the committee, OPM may select  additional nominees to serve as alternates to the primary committee  members. OPM designates not more than two OPM representatives to serve  on each committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each Executive agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, must  cooperate and release appointed employees for committee proceedings and  activities unless the agency can demonstrate that exceptional  circumstances directly related to accomplishing the mission of the  employee's work unit require his or her presence on the job. Executive  agency employees serving as committee members are considered to be on  official assignment to an interagency function, rather than on leave,  and are eligible to receive reimbursement for authorized travel expenses  from their respective agencies.</p><p class="depth2">Sec.
