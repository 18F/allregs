                            <p class="depth0">After the pooling application is received (not less than 50 days before the effective date specified in the pooling agreement), the Board will either reject it or determine initially whether the pooling agreement is of major transportation importance and whether there is a substantial likelihood that the pooling agreement will unduly restrain competition. If neither of these two factors is present, the application will be granted without further hearing. Where either factor is found to exist, the application will be published in the Federal Register using the caption summary filed with the application, and a hearing will be scheduled (normally to receive written verified statements) to consider the issues further. In this second phase of the proceeding, the Board will consider whether the pooling agreement would be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition.</p>
