                                Sec. 199.16  Supplemental Health Care Program for active duty members.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of this section is to  implement, with respect to health care services provided under the  supplemental health care program for active duty members of the  uniformed services, the provision of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). This section of  law authorizes DoD to establish for the supplemental care program the  same payment rules, subject to appropriate modifications, as apply under  CHAMPUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section applies to the program, known as the supplemental  care   program, which provides for the payment by the uniformed services to  private sector health care providers for health care services provided  to active duty members of the uniformed services. Although not part of  CHAMPUS, the supplemental care program is similar to CHAMPUS in that it  is a program for the uniformed services to purchase civilian health care  services for active duty members. For this reason, the Director,  OCHAMPUS assists the uniformed services in the administration of the  supplemental care program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This section applies to all health care services covered by the  CHAMPUS. For purposes of this section, health care services ordered by a  military treatment facility (MTF) provider for an MTF patient (who is  not an active duty member) for whom the MTF provider maintains  responsibility are also covered by the supplemental care program and  subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obligation of providers concerning payment for supplemental  health care for active duty members--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hospitals covered by DRG-based  payment system. For a hospital covered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment  system to maintain its status as an authorized provider for CHAMPUS  pursuant to Sec. 199.6, that hospital must also be a participating  provider for purposes of the supplemental care program. As a  participating provider, each hospital must accept the DRG-based payment  system amount determined pursuant to Sec. 199.14 as payment in full for  the hospital services covered by the system. The failure of any hospital  to comply with this obligation subjects that hospital to exclusion as a  CHAMPUS-authorized provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other participating providers. For any institutional or  individual provider, other than those described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section that is a participating provider, the provider must also be  a participating provider for purposes of the supplemental care program.  The provider must accept the CHAMPUS allowable amount determined  pursuant to Sec. 199.14 as payment in full for the hospital services  covered by the system. The failure of any provider to comply with this  obligation subjects the provider to exclusion as a participating  provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rule for payment and administration. Subject to the  special rules and procedures in paragraph (d) of this section and the  waiver authority in paragraph (e) of this section, as a general rule the  provisions of Sec. 199.14 shall govern payment and administration of  claims under the supplemental care program as they do claims under  CHAMPUS. To the extent necessary to interpret or implement the  provisions of Sec. 199.14, related provisions of this part shall also be  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules and procedure. As exceptions to the general rule  in paragraph (c) of this section, the special rules and procedures in  this section shall govern payment and administration of claims under the  supplemental care program. These special rules and procedures are  subject to the TRICARE Prime Remote program for active duty service  members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and the waiver  authority of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is no patient cost sharing under the supplemental care  program. All amounts due to be paid to the provider shall be paid by the  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preauthorization by the Uniformed Services of each service is  required for the supplemental care program except for services in cases  of medical emergency (for which the definition in Sec. 199.2 shall  apply) or in cases governed by the TRICARE Prime Remote program for  active duty service members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.  It is the responsibility of the active duty members to obtain  preauthorization for each service. With respect to each emergency  inpatient admission, after such time as the emergency condition is  addressed, authorization for any proposed continued stay must be  obtained within two working days of admission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to the filing of claims and similar administrative  matters for which this part refers to activities of the CHAMPUS fiscal  intermediaries, for purposes of the supplemental care program,  responsibilities for claims processing, payment and some other  administrative matters may be assigned by the Director,   OCHAMPUS to the same fiscal intermediaries, other contractor, or to the  nearest military medical treatment facility or medical claims office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The annual cost pass-throughs for capital and direct medical  education costs that are available under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment  system are also available, upon request, under the supplemental care  program. To obtain payment include the number of active duty bed days as  a separate line item on the annual request to the CHAMPUS fiscal  intermediaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For providers other than participating providers, the Director,  OCHAMPUS may authorize payment in excess of CHAMPUS allowable amounts.  No provider may bill an active duty member any amount in excess of the  CHAMPUS allowable amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Members--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The  TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) program is available for certain active duty  members of the Uniformed Services assigned to remote locations in the  United States and the District of Columbia who are entitled to coverage  of medical care, and the standards for timely access to such care,  outside a military treatment facility that are comparable to coverage  for medical care and standards for timely access to such care as exist  under TRICARE Prime under Sec. 199.17. Those active duty members who are  eligible under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c)(3) and who enroll in  the TRICARE Prime Remote program, may not be required to receive routine  primary medical care at a military medical treatment facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. To receive health care services under the TRICARE  Prime Remote program, an individual must be an active duty member of the  Uniformed Services on orders for more than thirty consecutive days who  meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has a permanent duty assignment that is greater than fifty miles  or approximately one hour drive from a military treatment facility or  military clinic designated as adequate to provide the needed primary  care services to the active duty service member; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to the assignment of such duty, resides at a location  that is greater than fifty miles or approximately one hour from a  military medical treatment facility or military clinic designated as  adequate to provide the needed primary care services to the active duty  service member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Enrollment. An active duty service member eligible for the  TRICARE Prime Remote program must enroll in the program. If an eligible  active duty member does not enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote program,  the member shall receive health care services provide under the  supplemental health program subject to all requirements of this section  without application of the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Preauthorization. If a TRICARE Prime network under Sec. 199.17  exists in the remote location, the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active  duty member will select or be assigned a primary care manager. In the  absence of a TRICARE primary care manager in the remote location and if  the active duty member is not assigned to a military primary care  manager based on fitness for duty requirements, the TRICARE Prime Remote  enrolled active duty member may use a local TRICARE authorized provider  for primary health care services without preauthorization. Any referral  for specialty care will require the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active  duty member to obtain preauthorization for such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver authority. With the exception of statutory requirements,  any restrictions or limitations pursuant to the general rule in  paragraph (c) of this section, and special rules and procedures in  paragraph (d) of this section, may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS,  at the request of an authorized official of the uniformed service  concerned, based on a determination that such waiver is necessary to  assure adequate availability of health care services to active duty  members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Authorities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Uniformed Services may establish additional  procedures, consistent with this part, for the effective administration  of the supplemental care program in their respective services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is  responsible for the overall policy direction of the supplemental care  program and the administration of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue procedural requirements for  the implementation of this section, including requirement for claims  submission similar to those established by Sec. 199.7.  [56 FR 23801, May 24, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 58963, Nov. 5, 1993; 67  FR 5479, Feb. 6, 2002; 71 FR 50348, Aug. 25, 2006]</p>
