                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A statement of net worth must be filed with the  application for an award of fees. The statement shall reflect the net  worth of the applicant and all affiliates of the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The statement of net worth may be in any form  convenient to the applicant which fully discloses all the assets and  liabilities of the applicant and all the assets and liabilities of its  affiliates, as of the time of the initiation of the adversary  adjudication. Unaudited financial statements are acceptable unless the  administrative law judge or the Board of Directors otherwise requires.  Financial statements or reports to a Federal or state agency, prepared  before the initiation of the adversary adjudication for other purposes,  and accurate as of a date not more than three months prior to the  initiation of the proceeding, are acceptable in establishing net worth  as of the time of the initiation of the proceeding, unless the  administrative law judge or the Board of Directors otherwise requires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Assets and liabilities of individuals shall include  those beneficially owned within the meaning of the FDIC's rules and  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a bank, the portion  of the statement of net worth which relates to the bank shall consist of  a copy of the bank's last Consolidated Report of Condition and Income  filed before the initiation of the adversary adjudication. In all cases  the administrative law judge or the Board of Directors may call for  additional information needed to establish the applicant's net worth as  of the initiation of the proceeding. Except as adjusted by additional  information that was called for under the preceding sentence, net worth  shall be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the total  equity capital (or, in the case of mutual savings banks, the total  surplus accounts) as reported, in conformity with applicable  instructions and guidelines, on the bank's Consolidated Report of  Condition and Income filed for the last reporting date before the  initiation of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement confidential. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board of  Directors or required by law, the statement of net worth shall be for  the confidential use of counsel for the FDIC, the Board of Directors,  and the administrative law judge.</p>
