Requests for additional compensation must be supported by evidence that  the customary fees for the hours reasonably expended on the case would  result in an unreasonable fee award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing of petition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Petitions for attorney's fees shall be  filed within 30 days of a final reparation award:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With the presiding officer where the presiding officer's  decision awarding reparations became administratively final pursuant to  Sec. 502.227(a)(3) and Sec. 502.304(g); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With the Commission, if exceptions were filed to, or the  Commission reviewed, the presiding officer's reparation award decision  pursuant to Sec. 502.227 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, a reparation award shall be  considered final after a decision disposing of the merits of a complaint  is issued and the time for the filing of court appeals has run or after  a court appeal has terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Replies to petitions. Within 20 days of filing of the petition,  a reply to the petition may be filed by the respondent, addressing the  reasonableness of any aspect of the petitioner's claim. A respondent may  also suggest adjustments to the claim under the criteria stated in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ruling on petitions. Upon consideration of a petition and any  reply thereto, the Commission or the presiding officer shall issue an  order stating the total amount of attorney's fees awarded. The order  shall specify the hours and rate of compensation found awardable and  shall explain the basis for any additional adjustments. An award order  shall be served within 60 days of the date of the filing of the reply to  the petition or expiration of the reply period; except that in cases  involving a substantial dispute of facts   critical to the award determination, the Commission or presiding officer  may hold a hearing on such issues and extend the time for issuing a fee  award order by an additional 30 days.
