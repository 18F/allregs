                            <p class="depth0">The Coast Guard may grant an extension to the implementation schedule listed in Sec. 151.2035(b) of this subpart only in those cases where the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel subject to this subpart can document that despite all efforts to meet the ballast water discharge standard requirements in Sec. 151.2030 of this subpart, compliance is not possible. Any extension request must be made no later than 12 months before the scheduled implementation date listed in Sec. 151.2035(b) of this subpart and submitted in writing to the Commandant (CG-OES), Attn: Office of Operating and Environmental Standards, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7509. Summary information concerning all extension decisions, including the name of the vessel and vessel owner, the term of the extension, and the basis for the extension will be promptly posted on the Internet. Extensions will be for no longer than the minimum time needed, as determined by the Coast Guard, for the vessel to comply with the requirements of Sec. 151.2030.
