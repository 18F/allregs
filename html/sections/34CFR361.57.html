                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedures. The designated State unit must develop and implement procedures to ensure that an applicant or eligible individual who is dissatisfied with any determination made by personnel of the designated State unit that affects the provision of vocational rehabilitation services may request, or, if appropriate, may request through the individual's representative, a timely review of that determination. The procedures must be in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (k) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General requirements--(1) Notification. Procedures established by the State unit under this section must provide an applicant or eligible individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative notice of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The right to obtain review of State unit determinations that affect the provision of vocational rehabilitation services through an impartial due process hearing under paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The right to pursue mediation under paragraph (d) of this section with respect to determinations made by designated State unit personnel that affect the provision of vocational rehabilitation services to an applicant or eligible individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The names and addresses of individuals with whom requests for mediation or due process hearings may be filed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manner in which a mediator or impartial hearing officer may be selected consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The availability of the client assistance program, established under 34 CFR part 370, to assist the applicant or eligible individual during mediation sessions or impartial due process hearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing. Notice described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be provided in writing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time the individual applies for vocational rehabilitation services under this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time the individual is assigned to a category in the State's order of selection, if the State has established an order of selection under Sec. 361.36;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At the time the IPE is developed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whenever vocational rehabilitation services for an individual are reduced, suspended, or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evidence and representation. Procedures established under this section must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide an applicant or eligible individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative with an opportunity to submit during mediation sessions or due process hearings evidence and other information that supports the applicant's or eligible individual's position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allow an applicant or eligible individual to be represented during mediation sessions or due process hearings by counsel or other advocate selected by the applicant or eligible individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Impact on provision of services. The State unit may not institute a suspension, reduction, or termination of vocational rehabilitation services being provided to an applicant or eligible individual, including evaluation and assessment services and IPE development, pending a resolution through mediation, pending a decision by a hearing officer or reviewing official, or pending informal resolution under this section unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual or, in appropriate cases, the individual's representative requests a suspension, reduction, or termination of services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State agency has evidence that the services have been obtained through misrepresentation, fraud, collusion, or criminal conduct on the part of the individual or the individual's representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ineligibility.

no longer eligible for vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to Sec. 361.43 are permitted to challenge the determinations of ineligibility under the procedures described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Informal dispute resolution. The State unit may develop an informal process for resolving a request for review without conducting mediation or a formal hearing. A State's informal process must not be used to deny the right of an applicant or eligible individual to a hearing under paragraph (e) of this section or any other right provided under this part, including the right to pursue mediation under paragraph (d) of this section. If informal resolution under this paragraph or mediation under paragraph (d) of this section is not successful in resolving the dispute within the time period established under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a formal hearing must be conducted within that same time period, unless the parties agree to a specific extension of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mediation. (1) The State must establish and implement procedures, as required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, to allow an applicant or eligible individual and the State unit to resolve disputes involving State unit determinations that affect the provision of vocational rehabilitation services through a mediation process that must be made available, at a minimum, whenever an applicant or eligible individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative requests an impartial due process hearing under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mediation procedures established by the State unit under paragraph (d) must ensure that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Participation in the mediation process is voluntary on the part of the applicant or eligible individual, as appropriate, and on the part of the State unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use of the mediation process is not used to deny or delay the applicant's or eligible individual's right to pursue resolution of the dispute through an impartial hearing held within the time period specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section or any other rights provided under this part.

must be held within 60 days of an applicant's or eligible individual's request for review of a determination made by personnel of the State unit that affects the provision of vocational rehabilitation services to the individual, unless informal resolution or a mediation agreement is achieved prior to the 60th day or the parties agree to a specific extension of time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the rights described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the applicant or eligible individual or, if appropriate, the individual's representative must be given the opportunity to present witnesses during the hearing and to examine all witnesses and other relevant sources of information and evidence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The impartial hearing officer must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Make a decision based on the provisions of the approved State plan, the Act, Federal vocational rehabilitation regulations, and State regulations and policies that are consistent with Federal requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide to the individual or, if appropriate, the individual's representative and to the State unit a full written report of the findings and grounds for the decision within 30 days of the completion of the hearing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The hearing officer's decision is final, except that a party may request an impartial review under paragraph (g)(1) of this section if the State has established procedures for that review, and a party involved in a hearing may bring a civil action under paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Selection of impartial hearing officers. The impartial hearing officer for a particular case must be selected--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> From a list of qualified impartial hearing officers maintained by the State unit.
