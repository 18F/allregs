                            <p class="depth0">The Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535, generally permits agency heads, or  heads of major organizational units of agencies, to procure goods and  services from other agencies or within their own agency so long as funds  for procurement are available, the order is in the best interest of the  Government, the source from which the goods or services are ordered can  produce them or obtain them by contract, and the internal or inter- agency procurement is more convenient, or less expensive, than  commercial procurement. Provisions of the Economy Act apply to requests  from other Federal agencies for medical and dental care for  beneficiaries for whom they are responsible. Consult specific provisions  of the Act respecting financial and acounting limitations and  requirements.</p>
