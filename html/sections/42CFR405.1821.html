                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Discovery rule: Time limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limited prehearing discovery  may be permitted by the contractor hearing officer(s) upon request of a  party, provided the request is timely and the hearing officer(s) makes a  preliminary finding of its jurisdiction over the matters at issue in  accordance with Sec. 405.1814(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A prehearing discovery request is timely if the request by a  party is served no later than 120 days before the initially scheduled  starting date of the contractor hearing, unless the contractor hearing  officer(s) extends the time for requesting discovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the absence of a specific schedule for responses set by the  contractor hearing officer(s), responses to interrogatories and requests  for production of documents are due according to the schedule agreed  upon by the party serving discovery and the party to which the discovery  is directed. Responses by a party to interrogatories or requests for  production of documents must be served no later than 45 days before the  initially scheduled start of the contractor hearing, unless the  contractor hearing officer(s) orders otherwise. Responses by a nonparty  to requests for production of documents must be served no later than 75  days after the date the requests were served on the nonparty, unless the  party requesting the documents and the nonparty to which the requests  are directed agree on a different time for responding, or unless the  contractor hearing officer(s) extends the time for responding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before ruling on a request to extend the time for requesting  discovery or for responding to discovery, the hearing officer(s) must  give the other parties to the appeal and any nonparty subject to a  discovery request a reasonable period to respond to the extension  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the extension request is granted, the hearing officer(s) sets  a new deadline and has the discretion to reschedule the hearing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discovery criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The contractor hearing  officer(s) may permit discovery of a matter that is relevant to the  specific subject matter of the contractor hearing, provided the matter  is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and the  discovery request is not unreasonable, unduly burdensome or expensive,  or otherwise inappropriate. In determining whether to permit discovery,  and in fixing the scope and limits of any discovery, the hearing  officer(s) uses the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules 401 and  501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence for guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on discovery. Any discovery before the contractor  hearing officer(s) is limited as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A party may request of another party, or of a nonparty other  than CMS, HHS or any Federal agency, the reasonable production of  documents for inspection and copying.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A party may request another party to respond to a reasonable  number of written interrogatories.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A party may not request admissions, take oral or written  depositions, or take any other form of discovery not permitted under  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Discovery procedures. Rights of nonparties: Motions to compel or  for protective order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party may request discovery of another party  to the proceedings before the contractor hearing officer(s) or of a  nonparty other than CMS, HHS or other Federal agency. Any discovery  request filed with the contractor hearing officer(s) must be mailed  promptly to the party or nonparty from which the discovery is requested,  and to any other party to the contractor hearing (as described in Sec.  405.1815 of this subpart).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a discovery request is made of a nonparty to the contractor  hearing,   the nonparty has the rights any party has in responding to a discovery  request. The rights of the nonparty include, but are not limited to, the  right to select and use any attorney or other representative, and to  submit discovery responses, objections, or motions to the hearing  officer(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each party and nonparty is required to make a good faith effort  to resolve or narrow any discovery dispute, regardless of whether the  dispute is with another party or a nonparty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A party may submit to the contractor hearing officer(s) a motion  to compel discovery that is permitted under this section, and a motion  for a protective order regarding any discovery request may be submitted  to the hearing officer(s) by a party or nonparty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any motion to compel or for protective order must include a  self-sworn declaration describing the movant's efforts to resolve or  narrow the discovery dispute. A self-sworn declaration describing  efforts to resolve or narrow a discovery dispute also must be included  with any response to a motion to compel or for a protective order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The hearing officer(s) must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Decide the motion in accordance with this section and any prior  discovery ruling; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Issue and mail to each party and any affected nonparty a  discovery ruling that grants or denies the motion to compel or for  protective order in whole or in part; if applicable the discovery ruling  must specifically identify any part of the disputed discovery request  upheld and any part rejected, and impose any limits on discovery the  hearing officer(s) finds necessary and appropriate. Nothing in this  section authorizes the contractor hearing officer to compel any action  from the Secretary or CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reviewability of discovery or disclosure rulings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General  rule. A discovery ruling issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of  this section, or a disclosure ruling (such as one issued at a hearing),  is not subject to immediate review by a CMS official (as described in  Sec. 405.1834(b)(3) of this subpart). A discovery ruling may be  examined solely during the course of CMS review under Sec. 405.1834 of  this subpart of a jurisdictional dismissal decision (as described in  Sec. 405.1814(c)(2) of this subpart) or a hearing decision (as  described in Sec. 405.1831 of this subpart) by the contractor hearing  officer(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. To the extent a ruling authorizes discovery or  disclosure of a matter for which an objection based on privilege or  other protection from disclosure such as case preparation,  confidentiality, or undue burden, was made before the contractor hearing  officer(s), that portion of the discovery or disclosure ruling may  immediately be reviewed by a CMS reviewing official in accordance with  Sec. 405.1834(b)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon notice to the contractor hearing officer that the provider  intends to seek immediate review of a ruling, or that the contractor or  other affected nonparty intends to suggest that the Administrator  through the CMS reviewing official, take own motion review of the  ruling, the contractor hearing officer stays all proceedings affected by  the ruling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contractor hearing officer must determine, under the  circumstances of a given case, the length of any stay, but in no event  may the stay be less than 15 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the Administrator through the CMS reviewing official--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Grants a request for review, or takes own motion review, of a  ruling, the ruling is stayed until such time as the CMS reviewing  official issues a written decision that affirms, reverses, modifies, or  remands the contractor hearing officer's ruling.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Does not grant review or take own motion review within the time  allotted for the stay, the stay is lifted and the ruling is not subject  to immediate review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prehearing conference. The contractor hearing officer(s) has  discretion to schedule a prehearing conference. A prehearing conference  may be conducted in person or telephonically, at the discretion of the  contractor hearing officer(s). When a panel of contractor hearing  officers is designated, the panel may appoint one or more hearing  officers to act for the panel for any prehearing conference or any  matter addressed at the conference.
