                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The local number portability administrator, as defined in Sec. 52.21(h), of each regional database, as defined in Sec. 52.21(1), shall recover the shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to that regional database from

all telecommunications carriers providing telecommunications service in areas that regional database serves. Pursuant to its duties under Sec. 52.26, the local number portability administrator shall collect sufficient revenues to fund the operation of the regional database by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assessing a $100 yearly contribution on each telecommunications carrier identified in paragraph (a) introductory text that has no intrastate, interstate, or international end-user telecommunications revenue derived from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assessing on each of the other telecommunications carriers providing telecommunications service in areas that regional database serves, a charge that recovers the remaining shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to that regional database in proportion to the ratio of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the intrastate, interstate, and international end-user telecommunications revenues that such telecommunications carrier derives from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves, ii) to the sum of the intrastate, interstate, and international end-user telecommunications revenues that all telecommunications carriers derive from providing telecommunications service in the areas that regional database serves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All telecommunications carriers providing service in the United States shall complete and submit a ``Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet'' (as published by the Commission in the Federal Register), which sets forth the information needed to calculate contributions referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The worksheet shall be certified to by an officer of the contributor, and subject to verification by the Commission or the administrator at the discretion of the Commission. The Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or eliminate contributor reporting requirements that prove unnecessary and require additional reporting requirements that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound and efficient administration of long-term number portability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Local number portability administrators shall keep all data obtained from contributors confidential and shall not disclose such data in company-specific form unless directed to do so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau, the local number portability administrators may share data obtained from carriers with the administrators of the universal service support mechanism (See 47 CFR 54.701 of this chapter), the TRS Fund (See 47 CFR 64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter), and the North American Numbering Plan cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.16). The local number portability administrators shall keep confidential all data obtained from other administrators. The administrators shall use such data, from carriers or administrators, only for purposes of administering local number portability. The Commission shall have access to all data reported to the Administrator. Contributors may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of company-specific revenue information under Sec. 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data are submitted. The Commission shall make all decisions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Once a telecommunications carrier has been allocated, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, its portion of the shared costs of long-term number portability attributable to a regional database, the carrier shall treat that portion as a carrier-specific cost directly related to providing number portability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For the purposes of this section, the term ``telecommunications carrier'' shall include interconnected VoIP providers as that term is defined in Sec. 52.21(h); and ``telecommunications service'' shall include ``interconnected VoIP service'' as that term is defined in 47 CFR 9.3.
