                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Grantor revocable trust means a trust that holds irrigable land or  irrigation land that may be revoked at the discretion of the grantor(s),  or terminated by the terms of the trust, and revocation or termination  results in title to the   land held in trust reverting either directly or indirectly to the  grantor(s).</p><p class="depth2">Irrevocable trust means a trust that holds irrigable land or  irrigation land and does not allow any individual, including the grantor  or beneficiaries, the discretion to decide when or under what conditions  the trust terminates, and that upon termination the title to the land  held in trust transfers either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or  entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).</p><p class="depth2">Otherwise revocable trust means a trust that holds irrigable land or  irrigation land and that may be revoked at the discretion of the  grantor(s) or other parties, or terminated by the terms of the trust,  and revocation or termination results in the title to the land held in  trust transferring either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or  entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Attribution of land held by a trust. The acreage limitation  entitlements of a trust are only limited by the acreage limitation  entitlements of the trustees, grantors, or beneficiaries to whom land  held by the trust must be attributed as provided for in Sec. 426.4. The  entitlements of the parties to whom trusted land is attributed are  determined according to Sec. Sec. 426.5, 426.6, and 426.8, and other  applicable provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations.  Reclamation attributes nonexempt land held by a trust to the following  parties:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section are met. If the trust  fails to meet any portion of these criteria, Reclamation attributes the  land held in the trust to the trustee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The trust is in written form and approved by Reclamation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The beneficiaries of the trust and the beneficiaries'  respective interests are identified within the trust document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section are met.  If the trust fails to meet any portion of these criteria, the land held  in trust will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until all of the  criteria are met. The only exception is if the trust's and grantor's  standard certification or reporting forms indicate that the land held by  the trust has been attributed to the trust's grantor(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The grantor(s) of all land held by the trust is (are)  identified within the trust document;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The conditions under which the trust may be revoked or  terminated are identified within the trust document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The recipient(s) of the trust land upon revocation or  termination is (are) identified within the trust document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For land held in an otherwise revocable trust, the land is  attributed to the beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial  interests in the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the  trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section  and the trust meets the additional criteria specified in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If Reclamation cannot determine who will hold the land in trust  upon termination or revocation of the trust, or who is the grantor(s) of  the land held in trust, then irrigation water will not be made available  to the land held in trust until the trust satisfies the additional  criteria listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> through (iv) of this section, then the land is  attributed to the trustee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class beneficiaries. For purposes of identifying beneficiaries,  a class of beneficiaries specified within the trust document will be  acceptable, as long as the trust document is specific as to the  beneficial interest to which each member of the class will be entitled  and the members of the class are identifiable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attribution during any given water year will be provided only to   class beneficiaries that are natural persons and established legal  entities. For purposes of administering the acreage limitation  provisions, attribution to unborn or deceased persons, or entities not  yet established, will not be allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a trust includes a class of beneficiaries to which land  subject to the acreage limitation provisions will be attributed, the  trustee and each of the beneficiaries will be required to submit  standard certification or reporting forms annually. The submittal of  verification forms, as provided in Sec. 426.18(l), will not be  applicable to such trusts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of full-cost rate to land held by grantor revocable  trusts. If a grantor revocable trust that meets the criteria specified  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is revised by the grantor in a  manner that precludes attribution of the land held in trust to the  grantor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before April 20, 1988, Reclamation will not assess full-cost  rates for the land held by the revised trust for the period before it  was revised; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or after April 20, 1988, Reclamation will charge the full- cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any land held by the trust  that exceeds the grantor's nonfull-cost entitlement, commencing December  23, 1987, until the trust agreement is revised to make it an irrevocable  trust or an otherwise revocable trust.</p>
