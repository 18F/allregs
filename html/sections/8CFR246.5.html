The Government shall be represented at the  hearing by a Service counsel who shall have authority to present  evidence, and to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the respondent  and other witnesses. The Service counsel is authorized to appeal from a  decision of the immigration judge pursuant to Sec. 246.7 and to move  for reopening or reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 3.23 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opening. The immigration judge shall advise the respondent of  the nature of the proceeding and the legal authority under which it is  conducted; advise the respondent of his or her right to representation,  at no expense to the Government, by counsel or representative of his or  her own choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter and require him  or her to state then and there whether he or she desires representation;  advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity  to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to present  evidence in his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses  presented by the Government; place the respondent under oath; read the  allegations in the notice to the respondent and explain them in  nontechnical language, and enter the notice and respondent's answer, if  any, as exhibits in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pleading by respondent. The immigration judge shall require the  respondent to state for the record whether he or she admits or denies  the allegations contained in the notice, or any of them, and whether he  or she concedes that his or her adjustment of status should be  rescinded. If the respondent admits all of the allegations and concedes  that the adjustment of status in his or her case should be rescinded  under the allegations set forth in the notice, and the immigration judge  is   satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, he or she may determine  that rescission as alleged has been established by the respondent's  admissions. The allegations contained in the notice shall be taken as  admitted when the respondent, without reasonable cause, fails or refuses  to attend or remain in attendance at the hearing.</p>
