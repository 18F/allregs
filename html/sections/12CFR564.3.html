For a transaction that does not require the services of a State certified or licensed appraiser under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(5) or (a)(7) of this section, the institution shall obtain an appropriate evaluation of real property collateral that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Appraisals to address safety and soundness concerns. The OTS reserves the right to require an appraisal under this part whenever the agency believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transactions requiring a State certified appraiser--(1) All transactions of $1,000,000 or more. All federally related transactions having a transaction value of $1,000,000 or more shall require an appraisal prepared by a State certified appraiser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonresidential and residential (other than 1-to-4 family) transactions of $250,000 or more. All federally related transactions having a transaction value of $250,000 or more, other than those involving appraisals of 1-to-4 family residential properties, shall require an appraisal prepared by a State certified appraiser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Complex residential transactions of $250,000 or more. All complex 1-to-4 family residential property appraisals rendered in connection with federally related transactions shall require a State certified appraiser if the transaction value is $250,000 or more. A regulated institution may presume that appraisals of 1-to-4 family residential properties are not complex, unless the institution has readily available information that a given appraisal will be complex. The regulated institution shall be responsible for making the final determination of whether the appraisal is complex. If during the course of the appraisal a licensed appraiser identifies factors that would result in the property, form of ownership, or market conditions being considered atypical, then either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and co-sign the appraisal; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transactions requiring either a State certified or licensed appraiser. All appraisals for federally related transactions not requiring the services of a State certified appraiser shall be prepared by either a State certified appraiser or a State licensed appraiser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. Savings associations are required to use State certified or licensed appraisers as set forth in this part no later than December 31, 1992.
