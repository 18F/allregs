                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Covered employees. Each calendar year, agencies must give verbal  ethics training to employees who are required by 5 CFR part 2634 to file  public financial disclosure reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of training. Agencies are encouraged to vary the content  of verbal training from year to year but the training must include, at  least, a review of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Principles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any agency supplemental standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Federal conflict of interest statutes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The names, titles, and office addresses and telephone numbers of  the designated agency ethics official and other agency ethics officials  available to advise the employee on ethics issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Length and presentation of training. Employees must be given at  least one hour of official duty time for verbal training. The training  must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Presented by a qualified instructor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prepared by a qualified instructor and presented by  telecommunications, computer, audiotape, or videotape.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Availability of qualified instructor. A qualified instructor  must be available during and immediately after the training. Qualified  instructors are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated agency ethics official;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternate agency ethics official;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A deputy agency ethics official;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employees of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) designated by  OGE; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Persons whom the designated agency ethics official (or his or  her designee) determines are qualified to respond to ethics questions  raised during the training.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1 to paragraph (d): An agency provides annual ethics  training for public filers in a regional office by establishing a video  conference link between the regional office and a qualified instructor  in the headquarters office. The video link provides for   direct and immediate communication between the qualified instructor and  the employees receiving the training. Even though the qualified  instructor is not physically located in the room where the training  occurs, the qualified instructor is available.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2 to paragraph (d): The agency described in the preceding  example provides videotaped training instead of training through a video  conference link. The employees viewing the videotape are provided with a  telephone at the training site and the telephone number of a qualified  instructor who is standing by during and immediately after the training  to answer any questions. Under these circumstances, a qualified  instructor is available.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3 to paragraph (d): In the preceding example, if no  telephone had been provided at the training site or if a qualified  instructor was not standing by to respond to any questions raised, there  would not be a qualified instructor available. Merely providing the  phone number of the qualified instructor would not satisfy the  requirement that a qualified instructor be available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions. Verbal training without a qualified instructor  available or written training prepared by a qualified instructor will  satisfy the verbal training requirement for a public filer (or group of  public filers) if one hour of official duty time is provided for the  training and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated agency ethics official (or his or her designee)  makes a written determination that it would be impractical to provide  verbal training with a qualified instructor available; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee is a special Government employee.</p><p class="depth3">Example to paragraph (e)(1): The only public filer in the American  Embassy in Ulan Bator, Mongolia is the Ambassador. Because of the  difference in time zones and the uncertainty of the Ambassador's  schedule, the designated agency ethics official for the State Department  is justified in making a written determination that it would be  impractical to provide the Ambassador with verbal training. In this  case, the Ambassador may receive written training prepared by a  qualified instructor.</p>
