                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Labor has been designated by the Governor of North Carolina to administer the plan throughout the State. The Department of Labor has entered into an agreement with the State Board of Health whereby the State Board of Health is to assist the Department of Labor in the administration and enforcement of occupational health standards. However, full authority for the promulgation and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards remains with the Department of Labor. The plan defines the covered occupational safety and health issues as defined by the Secretary of Labor in Sec. 1902.2(c)(1) of this chapter. Moreover, it is understood that the plan will cover all employers and employees in the State except those whose working conditions are not covered by the Federal act by virtue of section 4(b)(1) thereof, dockside maritime and domestic workers. The Department of Labor is currently exercising statewide inspection authority to enforce many State standards. The plan describes procedures for the development and promulgation of additional laws, and orders in all places of employment in the State; the procedures for prompt restraint or elimination of imminent danger conditions; and procedures for inspections in response to complaints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The plan includes proposed draft legislation to be considered by the North Carolina General Assembly during its 1973 session. Such legislation is designed to implement major portions of the plan and to bring it into conformity with the requirements of part 1902 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under this legislation, all occupational safety and health standards and amendments thereto which have been promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, except those found in parts 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918 of this chapter (ship repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and longshoring) will be adopted upon ratification of the proposed legislation. Enforcement of such standards will take place 90 days thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The legislation will give the Department of Labor full authority to administer and enforce all laws, rules and orders protecting employee safety and health in all places of employment in the State. It also proposes to bring the plan into conformity in procedures for providing prompt and effective standards for the protection of employees against new and unforeseen hazards and for furnishing information to employees on hazards, precautions, symptoms, and emergency treatment; and procedures for variances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The proposed legislation will insure employer and employee representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors and to call attention to possible violations before, during, and after inspections; protection of employees against discharge or discrimination in terms and conditions of employment; notice to employees of their protections and obligations; adequate safeguards to protect trade secrets; prompt notice to employers and employees of alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements; effective sanctions against employers; and employer's right to review of alleged violations, abatement periods, and proposed penalties with opportunity for employee participation in the review proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Plan also provides for the development of a program to encourage voluntary compliance by employers and employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Plan includes a statement of the Governor's support for the proposed legislation and a statement of legal opinion that it will meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and is consistent with the constitution and laws of North Carolina. The Plan sets out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full conformity with part 1902 upon enactment of the proposed legislation by the State legislature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The North Carolina Plan includes the following documents as of the date of approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Plan description document with appendixes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Telegram from the Governor of North Carolina, James E. Holshouser, Jr., expressing his full support for the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina and his anticipation of its passage during the 1973 session of the North Carolina General Assembly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Letter from W. C. Creel, Commissioner, North Carolina Department of Labor, to Mr. Thomas C. Brown, Director, Federal and State Operations, clarifying several issues raised during the review process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Also available for inspection and copying with the Plan documents will be the public comments received during the review process.
