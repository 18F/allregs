Upon an adequate preliminary showing to SBA,  SBA will publish in the Federal Register a notice of its receipt of a  request that it considers a change in the subcontracting percentage  requirements for a particular industry. The notice will identify the  group making the request, and give the public an opportunity to submit  information and arguments in both support and opposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comments. SBA will provide a period of not less than 30 days for  public comment in response to the Federal Register notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Decision. SBA will render its decision after the close of the  comment period. If SBA decides against a change, SBA will publish notice  of its decision in the Federal Register. Concurrent with the notice, SBA  will advise the requester of its decision in writing. If SBA decides in  favor of a change, SBA will propose an appropriate change to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance will be considered an element of responsibility and  not a component of size eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The period of time used to determine compliance for a total or  partial set-aside contract will be the base term and then each  subsequent option period. For an order set aside under a full and open  contract or a full and open contract with reserve, the agency will use  the period of performance for each order to determine compliance unless  the order is competed amongst small and other-than-small businesses (in  which case the subcontracting limitations will not apply). However, the  contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the concern  to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the  nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under a total or partial set  aside contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Work to be performed by subsidiaries or other affiliates of a  concern is not counted as being performed by the concern for purposes of  determining whether the concern will perform the required percentage of  work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(3)</em> of this chapter and qualifies as a small business  concern, the performance of work requirements set forth in this section  apply to the cooperative effort of the joint venture, not its individual  members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Where an offeror is exempt from affiliation under  Sec. 121.103(b)(8) of this chapter and qualifies as a small business  concern for a reserve of a bundled contract, the performance of work  requirements set forth in this section apply to the cooperative effort  of the small business team members of the Small Business Teaming  Arrangement, not its individual members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The contracting officer must document a small business concern's  performance of work requirements as part of the small business'  performance evaluation in accordance with the procedures set forth in  FAR 42.1502.
