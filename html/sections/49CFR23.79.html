                            <p class="depth0">No. As a recipient you must not use a local geographic preference.  For purposes of this section, a local geographic preference is any  requirement that gives an ACDBE located in one place (e.g., your local  area) an advantage over ACDBEs from other places in obtaining business  as, or with, a concession at your airport.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 23--Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation</p><p class="depth0">Instructions for Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation</p><p class="depth0">1. Insert name of airport receiving FAA financial assistance and AIP  number.</p><p class="depth0">2. Provide the name and contact information (phone, fax, e-mail) for  the person FAA should contact with questions about the report.</p><p class="depth0">3a. Provide the annual reporting period to which the report pertains  (e.g., October 2005-September 2006).</p><p class="depth0">3b. Provide the date on which the report is submitted to FAA.</p><p class="depth0">4. This block and blocks 5 and 6 concern non-car rental goals and  participation only. In this block, provide the overall non-car rental  percentage goal and the race-conscious (RC) and race-neutral (RN)  components of it. The RC and RN percentages should add up to the overall  percentage goal.</p><p class="depth0">5. For purposes of this block and blocks 6, 8, and 9, the  participation categories listed at the left of the block are the  following: ``Prime Concessions'' are concessions who have a direct  relationship with the airport (e.g., a company who has a lease agreement  directly with the airport to operate a concession). A ``subconcession''  is a firm that has a sublease or other agreement with a prime  concessionaire, rather than with the airport itself, to operate a  concession at the airport. A ``management contract'' is an agreement  between the airport and a firm to manage a portion of the airport's  facilities or operations (e.g., manage the parking facilities). ``Goods/ services'' refers to those goods and services purchased by the airport  itself or by concessionaires and management contractors from certified  DBEs.</p><p class="depth0">Block 5 concerns all non-car rental concession activity covered by  49 CFR part 23 during the reporting period, both new or continuing.</p><p class="depth0">In Column A, enter the total concession gross revenues for  concessionaires (prime and sub) and purchases of goods and services  (ACDBE and non-ACDBE combined) at the airport. In Column B, enter the  number of lease agreements, contracts, etc. in effect or taking place  during the reporting period in each participation category for all  concessionaires and purchases of goods and services (ACDBE and non-ACDBE  combined).</p><p class="depth0">Because, by statute, non-ACDBE management contracts do not count as  part of the base for ACDBE goals, the cells for total management  contract participation and ACDBE participation as a percentage of total  management contracting dollars are not intended to be filled in blocks  5, 6, 8, and 9.</p><p class="depth0">In Column C, enter the total gross revenues in each participation  category (ACDBEs) only. In Column D, enter the number of lease  agreements, contracts, etc., in effect or entered into during the  reporting period in each participation category for all concessionaires  and purchases of goods and services (ACDBEs only).</p><p class="depth0">Columns E and F are subsets of Column C: break out the total gross  revenues listed in Column C into the portions that are attributable to  race-conscious and race-neutral measures, respectively. Column G is a  percentage calculation. It answers the question, what percentage of the  numbers in Column A is represented by the corresponding numbers in  Column C?</p><p class="depth0">6. The numbers in this Block concern only new non-car rental  concession opportunities that arose during the current reporting period.  In other words, the information requested in Block 6 is a subset of that  requested in Block 5. Otherwise, this Block is filled out in the same  way as Block 5.</p><p class="depth0">7. Blocks 7-9 concern car rental goals and participation. In Block  7, provide the overall car rental percentage goal and the race-conscious  (RC) and race-neutral (RN) components of it. The RC and RN percentages  should add up to the overall percentage goal.</p><p class="depth0">8. Block 8 is parallel to Block 5, except that it is for car  rentals. The instructions for filling it out are the same as for Block  5.</p><p class="depth0">9. Block 9 is parallel to Block 6, except that it is for car  rentals. The information requested in Block 9 is a subset of that  requested in Block 8. The instructions for filling it out are the same  as for Block 6.</p><p class="depth0">10. Block 10 instructs recipients to bring forward the cumulative  ACDBE participation figures from Blocks 5 and 8, breaking down these  figures by race and gender categories. Participation by non-minority   women-owned firms should be listed in the ``non-minority women'' column.  Participation by firms owned by minority women should be listed in the  appropriate minority group column. The ``other'' column should be used  to reflect participation by individuals who are not a member of a  presumptively disadvantaged group who have been found disadvantaged on a  case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">11. This block instructs recipients to attach five information items  for each ACDBE firm participating in its program during the reporting  period. If the firm's participation numbers are reflected in Blocks 5-6  and/or 8-9, the requested information about that firm should be attached  in response to this item.</p><p class="depth0">Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation</p><p class="depth0">1.
