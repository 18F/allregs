The two digits following the hyphen designate the first model year for which a section is effective. A section remains effective until superseded.</p><p class="depth2">Example: Section 86.411-78 applies to 1978 and subsequent model years until it is superseded. If a Sec. 86.411-81 is promulgated it would take effect beginning with 1981; Sec. 86.411-78 would apply to years 1978 through 1980.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A reference to a section without a year designation implies the appropriate model year.</p><p class="depth2">Example: When considering 1979 vehicles a reference to Sec. 86.411 implies Sec. 86.411-79. However if no Sec. 86.411-79 has been promulgated then Sec. 86.411-78 is implied; See paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
