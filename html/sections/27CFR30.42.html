In the case of  completely denatured spirits, the gallonage of any lot or package may be  ascertained by determining its weight and apparent proof (hydrometer  indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and then multiplying the  weight of the wine gallons per pound factor shown in Table 4 for the  (apparent) proof.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))</p>
