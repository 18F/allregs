                            <p class="depth0">All bicycles (other than sidewalk bicycles) shall meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Locking devices. Wheels shall be secured to the bicycle frame  with a positive lock device. Locking devices on threaded axles shall be  tightened to the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rear wheels. There shall be no relative motion between the axle  and the frame when a force of 1,780 N (400 lbf) is applied symmetrically  to the axle for a period of 30 seconds in the direction of wheel  removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Front wheels. Locking devices, except quick-release devices,  shall withstand application of a torque in the direction of removal of  17 N-m (12.5 ft-lb).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quick-release devices. Lever-operated, quick-release devices  shall be adjustable to allow setting the lever position for tightness.  Quick-release levers shall be clearly visible to the rider and shall  indicate whether the levers are in a locked or unlocked position. Quick- release clamp action shall emboss the frame or fork when locked, except  on fiber reinforced plastics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Front hubs. Front hubs not equipped with lever-operated quick- release devices shall have a positive retention feature that shall be  tested in accordance with the front hub retention test, Sec.  1512.18(j)(3), to assure that when the locking devices are released the  wheel will not separate from the fork.
