The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing and as consent to the making

of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at OHA in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by OHA unless that office determines that the convenience of the complainant, applicant, recipient or SBA requires that another place be selected.

The administrative law judge may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record.
