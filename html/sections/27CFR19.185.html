                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A proprietor who uses a scale tank for tax determination must  ensure the accuracy of the scale through periodic testing. Testing of  the scale must be conducted at least every 6 months and whenever the  scale is adjusted or repaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A proprietor also must test, at least once a month, the  gallonage represented to be in a scale tank against the gallonage  indicated by volumetric determination of the contents of the tank.  However, if the scale is not used during a month, it is only necessary  to verify against the volumetric determination when the scale is next  used. The proprietor must make the volumetric determination in  accordance part 30 of this chapter. If the variation exceeds 0.5 percent  of the quantity shown in the tank, the proprietor must take appropriate  action to verify the accuracy of the scale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the appropriate TTB officer determines that a scale may be  inaccurate, the proprietor must test the accuracy of the scale.
