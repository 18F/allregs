You must identify in your notification of  compliance status report required by Sec. 63.2382(d) the subpart of  this part 63 with which the owner or operator of the offsite reloading  or cleaning facility complies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)(ii)(I)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the emission limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart  and comply with the applicable requirements for transfer racks specified  in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, for meeting emission limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Route emissions to fuel gas systems or back into a process as  specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use a vapor balancing system that routes organic HAP vapors  displaced from the loading of organic liquids into transport vehicles to  the storage tank from which the liquid being loaded originated or to  another storage tank connected to a common header.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a vapor balancing system that routes the organic HAP vapors  displaced from the loading of organic liquids into containers directly  (e.g., no intervening tank or containment area such as a room) to the  storage tank from which the liquid being loaded originated or to another  storage tank connected to a common header.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equipment leak components. For each pump, valve, and sampling  connection that operates in organic liquids service for at least 300  hours per year, you must comply with the applicable requirements under  40 CFR part 63, subpart TT (control level 1), subpart UU (control level  2), or subpart H. Pumps, valves, and sampling connectors that are  insulated to provide protection against persistent sub-freezing  temperatures are subject to the ``difficult to monitor'' provisions in  the applicable subpart selected by the owner or operator. This paragraph  only applies if the affected source has at least one storage tank or  transfer rack that meets the applicability criteria for control in Table  2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow the steps in 40 CFR 60.502(e) to ensure that organic  liquids are loaded only into vapor-tight transport vehicles and comply  with the provisions in 40 CFR 60.502(f) through (i), except substitute  the term ``transport vehicle'' at each occurrence of the term ``tank  truck'' or ``gasoline tank truck'' in those paragraphs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that organic liquids are loaded only into transport  vehicles that have a current certification in accordance with the U.S.  Department of Transportation (DOT) pressure test requirements in 49 CFR  part 180 for cargo tanks or 49 CFR 173.31 for tank cars.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operating limits. For each high throughput transfer rack, you  must meet each operating limit in Table 3 to this subpart for each  control device used to comply with the provisions of this subpart  whenever emissions from the loading of organic liquids are routed to the  control device. For each storage tank and low throughput transfer rack,  you must comply with the requirements for monitored parameters as  specified in subpart SS of this part for storage vessels and, during the  loading of organic liquids, for low throughput transfer racks,  respectively. Alternatively, you may comply with the operating limits in  Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For noncombustion devices, if you elect to demonstrate  compliance with a percent reduction requirement in Table 2 to this  subpart using total organic compounds (TOC) rather than organic HAP, you  must first demonstrate, subject to the approval of the Administrator,  that TOC is an appropriate surrogate for organic HAP in your case; that  is, for your storage tank(s) and/or transfer rack(s), the percent  destruction of organic HAP is equal to or higher than the percent  destruction of TOC. This demonstration must be conducted prior to or  during the initial compliance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Opening of a safety device is allowed at any time that it is  required to avoid unsafe operating conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If you elect to comply with this subpart by combining emissions  from different emission sources subject to this subpart in a single  control device, then you must comply with the provisions specified in  Sec. 63.982(f).
