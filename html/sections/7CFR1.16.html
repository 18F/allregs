                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, when additional time is needed to respond to the initial request or to an appeal, agencies shall acknowledge the request or the appeal in writing within the 20 working day time period, describe the unusual circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the anticipated date for a substantive response that may not exceed 10 additional working days, except as provided in the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In instances in which the agency, with respect to a particular request, has extended the response date by 10 additional working days, if the agency finds that it cannot make a response determination within the additional 10 working day period, the agency shall notify the requester and provide the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request to allow the agency to process the request within the extended time limit, or an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the requester refuses to reasonably modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for processing the request, the FOIA provides that such refusal shall be considered as a factor in determining whether there are exceptional circumstances that warrant granting additional time for the agency to complete its review of the records, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C)(iii). The term ``exceptional circumstances'' does not include a delay that results from a predictable agency backlog, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' that may justify delay are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another Department or agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of agency having substantial subject-matter interest in the request.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (b): Consultation regarding policy or legal issues between an agency and the Office of the General Counsel, Office of Communications, or the Department of Justice is not a basis for extension under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The 10-day extension authorized by this section may be divided between the initial and appellate reviews, but in no event shall the total extension exceed 10 working days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in this section shall preclude the agency and the requester from agreeing to an extension of time. Any such agreement should be confirmed in writing and should specify clearly the total time agreed upon.
