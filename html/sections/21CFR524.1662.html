Each 3-ounce unit of oxytetracycline  hydrochloride and hydrocortisone spray contains 300 milligrams of  oxytetracycline hydrochloride and 100 milligrams of hydrocortisone with  an inert freon propellant such that a 1-second spray treatment will  deliver approximately 2.5 milligrams of oxytetracycline hydrochloride  and 0.8 milligram of hydrocortisone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sponsor. See No. 054771 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of use in dogs and cats--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amount. A small quantity  should be sprayed on the affected surface by holding the container about  6 inches from the area to be treated and pressing the nozzle for 1 or 2  seconds. Only sufficient spray to coat the skin thinly is necessary. The  application of small amounts at frequent intervals will give best  results. Before treating animals with long or matted hair, it may be  necessary to clip the affected area or spread the hairs to allow the  medication to contact the skin surface. Relief may be noted following  the first or second treatment; however, treatment should not be  discontinued too soon after the initial favorable response has been  obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indications for use. For the relief of discomfort and continued  treatment of many allergic, infectious, and traumatic skin conditions;  for the prevention of bacterial infections in superficial wounds, cuts,  and abrasions, treatment of allergic dermatoses, including urticaria,  eczemas, insect bites, and cutaneous drug reactions, infections  associated with minor burns and wounds, and nonspecific pruritus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations. Keep away from eyes or other mucous membranes;  avoid inhaling; use with adequate ventilation; in case of deep or  puncture wounds or serious burns, consult a veterinarian.

Administer  topically to the eye two to four times daily.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indications for use. For the prophylaxis and local treatment of  superficial ocular infections due to oxytetracycline- and polymyxin- sensitive organisms including ocular infections due to streptococci,  rickettsiae, E. coli, and A. aerogenes (such as conjunctivitis,  keratitis, pinkeye, corneal ulcer, and blepharitis in dogs, cats,  cattle, sheep, and horses); ocular infections due to secondary bacterial  complications associated with distemper in dogs; and ocular infections  due to bacterial inflammatory conditions which may occur secondary to  other infectious diseases in dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, and horses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations. Allergic reactions may occasionally occur.  Treatment should be discontinued if reactions are severe. If new  infections due to nonsensitive bacteria or fungi appear during therapy,  appropriate measures should be taken.  [40 FR 13873, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 79 FR 10972, Feb. 27, 2014]</p>
