                                Sec. 1.564-1  Dividend carryover.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The dividend carryover from the two preceding  years, allowable only to personal holding companies, is includible in  the dividends paid deduction under section 561. It is computed as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, for each of the preceding two years, the deduction for  dividends paid under section 561 (determined without regard to the  dividend carryover to each such year) exceeds the taxable income  (adjusted as provided in section 545 for purposes of determining  undistributed personal holding company income) then the dividend  carryover to the taxable year is the sum of both such excess amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the  second preceding year (determined without regard to the dividend  carryover to such year) exceeds the taxable income for such year  (adjusted as provided in section 545), and if the taxable income for the  first preceding year (as so adjusted) exceeds the dividends paid  deduction for such first preceding year (as so determined), then the  dividend carryover to the taxable year shall be such excess amount for  the second preceding year, less such excess amount for the first  preceding year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If for the first preceding year the deduction for dividends paid  under section 561 (determined without regard to the dividend carryover  to such year) exceeds the taxable income (adjusted as provided in  section 545) for such year, and such excess is not present in the second  preceding year, then the dividend carryover to the taxable year shall be  such excess amount for the first preceding year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dividend carryover from year in which taxpayer was not a  personal holding company. In computing the dividend carryover, the  taxable income as adjusted under section 545 of any preceding taxable  year shall be determined as if the corporation was, under the law  applicable to such taxable year, a personal holding company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dividend carryover from year in which taxpayer was subject to  1939 Code. In a case where the first or the second preceding taxable  year began before the taxpayer's first taxable year under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954, the amount of the dividend carryover shall be  determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statement to be filed with return. Every corporation claiming a  dividend carryover for any taxable year shall   file with its return for such year a concise statement setting forth the  amount of the dividend carryover claimed and all material and pertinent  facts relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the  computation of the dividend carryover claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Computation of dividend carryover. The computation of the  dividend carryover may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The X Corporation, which files its income tax returns on  the calendar year basis, has taxable income, adjusted as required by  section 545, in the amount of $110,000 and has a dividends paid  deduction of $150,000 for the year 1954. For 1955, its taxable income,  adjusted as required by section 545, is $200,000 and its dividends paid  deduction is $300,000. The dividend carryover to the year 1956 is  $140,000, computed as follows:  Dividends paid deduction for 1954...........................    $150,000 Taxable income for 1954.....................................     110,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Dividend carryover from 1954................................      40,000</p><p class="depth2">=========== Dividends paid deduction for 1955...........................     300,000 Taxable income for 1955.....................................     200,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Dividend carryover from 1955................................     100,000</p><p class="depth2">=========== Dividend carryover for 2 preceding taxable years, allowable      140,000</p><p class="depth2">as a deduction for the year 1956...........................</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The Y Corporation, which files its income tax returns on  the calendar year basis, has taxable income, adjusted as required by  section 545, in the amount of $100,000 and has a dividends paid  deduction of $150,000 for the year 1954. For 1955, its taxable income,  adjusted as required by section 545, is $200,000 and its dividends paid  deduction is $170,000. The dividend carryover to the year 1956 is  $20,000 computed as follows:  Dividends paid deduction for 1954...........................    $150,000 Taxable income for 1954.....................................     100,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Dividend carryover from 1954................................      50,000</p><p class="depth2">=========== Taxable income for 1955.....................................     200,000 Dividends paid deduction for 1955...........................     170,000</p><p class="depth2">----------- Excess of taxable income over dividends paid deduction......      30,000</p><p class="depth2">=========== Dividend carryover for second preceding taxable year,             20,000</p><p class="depth2">allowable as a deduction for the year 1956.................</p><p class="depth2"></p>
