Any program income earned after the end of grant support should be returned to the United States Treasury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No salary or fringe benefit payments may be made from HHS awarding agency grant funds to support career, career-conditional, or other Federal employees (civilian or uniformed services) without permanent appointments at a Federal institution receiving a grant.
