Flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol may be used in producing a malt beverage. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no more than 49% of the overall alcohol content of the finished product may be derived from the addition of flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol. For example, a finished malt beverage that contains 5.0% alcohol by volume must derive a minimum of 2.55% alcohol by volume from the fermentation of barley malt and other materials and may derive not more than 2.45% alcohol by volume from the addition of flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of malt beverages with an alcohol content of more than 6% by volume, no more than 1.5% of the volume of the malt beverage may consist of alcohol derived from added flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Processing. Malt beverages may be filtered or otherwise processed in order to remove color, taste, aroma, bitterness, or other characteristics derived from fermentation.
