                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(A)</em> of the Act,  hereby identifies the following as the best technology, treatment  techiques or other means generally available for achieving compliance  with the maximum contaminant level for total trihalomethanes (Sec.   141.12(c)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of chloramines as an alternate or supplemental disinfectant  or oxidant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of chlorine dioxide as an alternate or supplemental  disinfectant or oxidant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Improved existing clarification for THM precursor reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Moving the point of chlorination to reduce TTHM formation and,  where necessary, substituting for the use of chlorine as a pre-oxidant  chloramines, chlorine dioxide or potassium permanganate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use of powdered activated carbon for THM precursor or TTHM  reduction seasonally or intermittently at dosages not to exceed 10 mg/L  on an annual average basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator in a state that does not have primary  enforcement responsibility or a state with primary enforcement  responsibility (primacy state) that issues variances shall require a  community water system to install and/or use any treatment method  identified in Sec.  142.60(a) as a condition for granting a variance  unless the Administrator or primacy state determines that such treatment  method identified in Sec.  142.60(a) is not available and effective for  TTHM control for the system. A treatment method shall not be considered  to be ``available and effective'' for an individual system if the  treatment method would not be technically appropriate and technically  feasible for that system or would only result in a marginal reduction in  TTHM for the system. If, upon application by a system for a variance,  the Administrator or primacy state that issues variances determines that  none   of the treatment methods identified in Sec.  142.60(a) is available and  effective for the system, that system shall be entitled to a variance  under the provisions of section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the Act. The  Administrator's or primacy state's determination as to the availability  and effectiveness of such treatment methods shall be based upon studies  by the system and other relevant information. If a system submits  information intending to demonstrate that a treatment method is not  available and effective for TTHM control for that system, the  Administrator or primacy state shall make a finding whether this  information supports a decision that such treatment method is not  available and effective for that system before requiring installation  and/or use of such treatment method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> through (g) or corresponding state  regulations, the Administrator or primacy state that issues variances  shall issue a schedule of compliance that may require the system being  granted the variance to examine the following treatment methods (1) to  determine the probability that any of these methods will significantly  reduce the level of TTHM for that system, and (2) if such probability  exists, to determine whether any of these methods are technically  feasible and economically reasonable, and that the TTHM reductions  obtained will be commensurate with the costs incurred with the  installation and use of such treatment methods for that system:</p><p class="depth2">Introduction of off-line water storage for THM precursor reduction.</p><p class="depth2">Aeration for TTHM reduction, where geographically and  environmentally appropriate.</p><p class="depth2">Introduction of clarification where not currently practiced.</p><p class="depth2">Consideration of alternative sources of raw water.</p><p class="depth2">Use of ozone as an alternate or supplemental disinfectant or  oxidant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Administrator or primacy state that issues variances  determines that a treatment method identified in Sec.  142.60(c) is  technically feasible, economically reasonable and will achieve TTHM  reductions commensurate with the costs incurred with the installation  and/or use of such treatment method for the system, the Administrator or  primacy state shall require the system to install and/or use that  treatment method in connection with a compliance schedule issued under  the provisions of section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the Act. The Administrator's  or primacy state's determination shall be based upon studies by the  system and other relevant information. In no event shall the  Administrator require a system to install and/or use a treatment method  not described in Sec.  142.60 (a) or (c) to obtain or maintain a  variance from the TTHM Rule or in connection with any variance  compliance schedule.
