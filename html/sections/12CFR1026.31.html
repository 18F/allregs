                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Relation to other subparts in this part. The requirements and limitations of this subpart are in addition to and not in lieu of those contained in other subparts of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of disclosures. The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep. The disclosures required by this subpart may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of disclosure--(1) Disclosures for high-cost mortgages. The creditor shall furnish the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.32 at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening of a high-cost mortgage as defined in Sec. 1026.32(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosures for high-cost mortgages. The creditor shall furnish the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.32 at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening of a high-cost mortgage as defined in Sec. 1026.32(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Change in terms. After complying with this paragraph (c)(1) and prior to consummation or account opening, if the creditor changes any term that makes the disclosures inaccurate, new disclosures shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Telephone disclosures. A creditor may provide new disclosures required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by telephone if the consumer initiates the change and if, prior to or at consummation or account opening:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The creditor provides new written disclosures; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The consumer and creditor sign a statement that the new disclosures were provided by telephone at least three days prior to consummation or account opening, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Consumer's waiver of waiting period before consummation or account opening. The consumer may, after receiving the disclosures required by this paragraph (c)(1), modify or waive the three-day waiting period between delivery of those disclosures and consummation or account opening if the consumer determines that the extension of credit is needed to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency. To modify or waive the right, the consumer shall give the creditor a dated written statement that describes the emergency, specifically modifies or waives the waiting period, and bears the signature of all the consumers entitled to the waiting period. Printed forms for this purpose are prohibited, except when creditors are permitted to use printed forms pursuant to Sec. 1026.23(e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosures for reverse mortgages. The creditor shall furnish the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.33 at least three business days prior to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consummation of a closed-end credit transaction; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The first transaction under an open-end credit plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Basis of disclosures and use of estimates--(1) Legal Obligation. Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legal Obligation. Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimates. If any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best information reasonably available at the time the disclosure is provided, and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Per-diem interest. For a transaction in which a portion of the interest is determined on a per-diem basis and collected at consummation, any disclosure affected by the per-diem interest shall be considered accurate if the disclosure is based on the information known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are prepared.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If a transaction involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be given and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the

requirements that this part imposes on any or all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation. If the transaction is rescindable under Sec. 1026.15 or Sec. 1026.23, however, the disclosures shall be made to each consumer who has the right to rescind.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effect of subsequent events. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the creditor delivers the required disclosures, the inaccuracy is not a violation of Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026), although new disclosures may be required for mortgages covered by Sec. 1026.32 under paragraph (c) of this section, Sec. 1026.9(c), Sec. 1026.19, or Sec. 1026.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accuracy of annual percentage rate. For purposes of section 1026.32, the annual percentage rate shall be considered accurate, and may be used in determining whether a transaction is covered by section 1026.32, if it is accurate according to the requirements and within the tolerances under section 1026.22 for closed-end credit transactions or 1026.6(a) for open-end credit plans. The finance charge tolerances for rescission under section 1026.23(g) or (h) shall not apply for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Corrections and unintentional violations. A creditor or assignee in a high-cost mortgage, as defined in Sec. 1026.32(a), who, when acting in good faith, failed to comply with any requirement under section 129 of the Act will not be deemed to have violated such requirement if the creditor or assignee satisfies either of the following sets of conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Within 30 days of consummation or account opening and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of or discovers the violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 30 days of consummation or account opening and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of or discovers the violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appropriate restitution is made within a reasonable time; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within a reasonable time, whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan or credit plan to either, at the choice of the consumer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Make the loan or credit plan satisfy the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1631-1651; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Change the terms of the loan or credit plan in a manner beneficial to the consumer so that the loan or credit plan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> Within 60 days of the creditor's discovery or receipt of notification of an unintentional violation or bona fide error and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of the compliance failure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 60 days of the creditor's discovery or receipt of notification of an unintentional violation or bona fide error and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of the compliance failure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appropriate restitution is made within a reasonable time; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within a reasonable time, whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan or credit plan to either, at the choice of the consumer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Make the loan or credit plan satisfy the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1631-1651; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Change the terms of the loan or credit plan in a manner beneficial to the consumer so that the loan or credit plan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage.
