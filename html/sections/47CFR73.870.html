                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A minor change for an LPFM station authorized under this subpart is limited to transmitter site relocations of 5.6 kilometers or less. These distance limitations do not apply to amendments or applications proposing transmitter site relocation to a common location filed by applicants that are parties to a voluntary time-sharing agreement with regard to their stations pursuant to Sec.  73.872 paragraphs (c) and (e). These distance limitations also do not apply to an amendment or application proposing transmitter site relocation to a common location or a location very close to another station operating on a third-adjacent channel in order to remediate interference to the other station; provided, however, that the proposed relocation is consistent with all localism certifications made by the applicant in its original application for the LPFM station. Minor changes of LPFM stations may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Changes in frequency to adjacent or IF frequencies or, upon a technical showing of reduced interference, to any frequency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amendments to time-sharing agreements, including universal agreements that supersede involuntary arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission will specify by Public Notice a window filing period for applications for new LPFM stations and major modifications in the facilities of authorized LPFM stations. LPFM applications for new facilities and for major modifications in authorized LPFM stations will be accepted only during the appropriate window. Applications submitted prior to the window opening date identified in the Public Notice will be returned as premature. Applications submitted after the deadline will be dismissed with prejudice as untimely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications subject to paragraph (b) of this section that fail to meet the Sec.  73.807 minimum distance separations with respect to all applications and facilities in existence as the date of the pertinent public notice in paragraph (b) of this section other than to LPFM station facilities proposed in applications filed in the same window, will be dismissed without any opportunity to amend such applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Following the close of the window, the Commission will issue a Public Notice of acceptance for filing of applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section that meet technical and legal requirements and that are not in conflict with any other application filed during the window. Following the close of the window, the Commission also will issue a Public Notice of the acceptance for filing of all applications tentatively selected pursuant to the procedures for mutually exclusive LPFM applications set forth at Sec.  73.872. Petitions to deny such applications may be filed within 30 days of such public notice and in accordance with the procedures set forth at Sec.  73.3584. A copy of any petition to deny must be served on the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minor change LPFM applications may be filed at any time, unless restricted by the staff, and generally, will be processed in the order in which they are tendered. Such applications must meet all technical and legal requirements applicable to new LPFM station applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> New entrants seeking to apply for unused or unwanted time on a time-sharing frequency will only be accepted during an open filing window, specified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
