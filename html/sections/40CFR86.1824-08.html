                                Sec. 86.1824-08  Durability demonstration procedures for evaporative
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes durability demonstration procedures for  evaporative emissions. Eligible small-volume manufacturers or small- volume test groups may optionally meet the requirements of Secs. 86.1826  and 86.1838 instead of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (j) of  this section. A separate durability demonstration is required for each  evaporative/refueling family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Durability program objective. The durability program must  predict an expected in-use emission deterioration rate and emission  level that effectively represents a significant majority of the  distribution of emission levels and deterioration in actual use over the  full useful life of candidate in-use vehicles of each vehicle design  which uses the durability program. This requirement applies for all  SHED-based measurements except the bleed emission test. The standard for  bleed emissions applies for the full useful life, but manufacturers do  not need to establish deterioration factors for bleed emissions. The  requirements of this section do not apply for spitback or leak  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required durability demonstration. Manufacturers must conduct a  durability demonstration which satisfies the provisions of either  paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whole vehicle evaporative durability demonstration. (1) Mileage  accumulation must be conducted using the SRC or any road cycle approved  under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mileage accumulation must be conducted for either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicable full useful life mileage period specified in  Sec. 86.1805, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, except that the DF  must be based upon a line projected to the full-useful life mileage  using the upper 80 percent statistical confidence limit calculated from  the emission data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer must conduct at least one evaporative emission  test at each of the five different mileage points selected using good  engineering judgement. The required testing must include testing at  5,000 miles and at the highest mileage point run during mileage  accumulation (e.g. the full useful life mileage). Additional testing may  be conducted by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement. The  manufacturer may select to run either the 2-day and/or 3-day evaporative  test at each test point using good engineering judgement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bench aging evaporative durability procedures. Manufacturers may  use bench procedures designed, using good engineering judgement, to  evaluate the emission deterioration of evaporative control systems.  Manufacturers may base the bench procedure on an evaluation the  following potential causes of evaporative emission deterioration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cycling of canister loading due to diurnal and refueling events,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of various commercially available fuels, including the Tier  2 requirement to include alcohol fuel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vibration of components;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Deterioration of hoses, etc. due to environmental conditions;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Deterioration of fuel cap due to wear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Combined whole-vehicle and bench-aging programs. Manufacturers  may combine the results of whole vehicle aging and bench aging  procedures using good engineering judgement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fuel requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For gasoline fueled vehicles certified to  meet the evaporative emission standards set forth in this subpart, any  mileage accumulation method for evaporative emissions must employ  gasoline fuel for the entire mileage accumulation period which contains  ethanol in, at least, the highest concentration permissible in gasoline  under federal law   and that is commercially available in any state in the United States.  Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer must  determine the appropriate ethanol concentration by selecting the highest  legal concentration commercially available during the calendar year  before the one in which the manufacturer begins its mileage  accumulation. The manufacturer must also provide information acceptable  to the Administrator to indicate that the mileage accumulation method is  of sufficient design, duration and severity to stabilize the  permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system components  to the mileage accumulation fuel constituents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For flexible-fueled, dual-fueled, multi-fueled, ethanol-fueled  and methanol-fueled vehicles certified to meet the evaporative emission  standards set forth in Sec. 86.1811-04(e)(1), any mileage accumulation  method must employ fuel for the entire mileage accumulation period which  the vehicle is designed to use and which the Administrator determines  will have the greatest impact upon the permeability of evaporative and  fuel system components. The manufacturer must also provide information  acceptable to the Administrator to indicate that the mileage  accumulation method is of sufficient design, duration and severity to  stabilize the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative  system components to mileage accumulation fuel constituents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer may use other methods, based upon good  engineering judgment, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and  (2) of this section, as applicable. These methods must be approved in  advance by the Administrator and meet the objectives of paragraphs  (f)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable: to provide assurance that  the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system  components will not lead to evaporative emission standard exceedance  under sustained exposure to commercially available alcohol-containing  fuels for the useful life of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Calculation of a deterioration factor. The manufacturer must  calculate a deterioration factor which is applied to the evaporative  emission results of the emission data vehicles. The deterioration factor  must be based on a linear regression, or an other regression technique  approved in advance by the Administrator. The DF will be calculated to  be the difference between the full life mileage evaporative level minus  the stabilized mileage (e.g., 4000-mile) evaporative level from the  regression analysis. The full useful life regressed emission value, the  stabilized mileage regressed emission value, and the DF result must be  rounded to the same precision and using the same procedures as the raw  emission results according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1837-01.  Calculated DF values of less than zero must be changed to zero for the  purposes of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If EPA determines based on IUVP data or other information that  the durability procedure does not achieve the durability objective of  paragraph (a) of this section, EPA may withdraw approval to use the  durability procedure or condition approval on modifications to the  durability procedure. Such withdrawal or conditional approval will apply  to future applications for certification and to the portion of the  manufacturer's product line (or the entire product line) that the  Administrator determines to be affected. Prior to such a withdrawal the  Administrator will give the manufacturer a preliminary notice at least  60 days prior to the final decision. During this period, the  manufacturer may submit technical discussion, statistical analyses,  additional data, or other information which is relevant to the decision.  The Administrator will consider all information submitted by the  deadline before reaching a final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's  withdrawal of approval in paragraph (i) of this section. The request  must be in writing and must include a statement specifying the  manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and  data in support of such objection. If, after review of the request and  supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a  substantial factual issue, she/he must provide the manufacturer a  hearing in   accordance with Sec. 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Emission component durability.
