                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section a record will be made of any communication, whether written, by telephone, at a meeting, or otherwise, received by the Internal Revenue Service or Office of its Chief Counsel prior to the issuance

of written determination from any person other than a person to whom the written determination pertains or the authorized representative of such person. This rule applies to any communication concerning such written determination, any communication concerning the request for such written determination, or any communication concerning other matters involving such written determination. A notation that such communication has been made shall be placed on such written determination when it is made open to public inspection or available for inspection upon written request pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-5. The notation to be placed on a written determination shall consist of the date on which the communication was received and the category of the person making such communication, for example, Congressional, Department of Commerce, Treasury, trade association, White House, educational institution. Any person may request the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the name of any person about whom a notation has been made pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to communications received by the Internal Revenue Service from employee of the Internal Revenue Service or Office of its Chief Counsel, from the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, from the Department of Justice with respect to any pending civil or criminal case or investigation, or from another government agency in response to a request made by the Internal Revenue Service to such agency for assistance involving the expertise of such agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action to obtain disclosure of identity of person to whom written determination pertains--(1) Creation of remedy. With respect to any written determination on which a notation has been placed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, any person may file a petition in the United States Tax Court or file a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that the identity of any person to whom such written determination pertains be disclosed, but such petition or complaint must be filed within 36 months of the date such written determination is made open or subject to inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creation of remedy. With respect to any written determination on which a notation has been placed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, any person may file a petition in the United States Tax Court or file a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that the identity of any person to whom such written determination pertains be disclosed, but such petition or complaint must be filed within 36 months of the date such written determination is made open or subject to inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Necessary disclosure. Whenever an action is brought pursuant to section 6110(d)(3), the court may order that the identity of any person to whom the written determination pertains be disclosed. Such disclosure may be ordered if the court determines that there is evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be concluded that an impropriety occurred or undue influence was exercised with respect to such written determination by or on behalf of the person to whom the written determination pertains. The court may, pursuant to section 6110(d)(3), also order the disclosure of any material deleted pursuant to section 6110(c) if such disclosure is in the public interest. The written determination or background file document with respect to which the disclosure was sought shall be revised to disclose the information which the court orders to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required notice. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to any written determination, the Secretary shall send notice of the commencement of such proceeding to any person whose identity is subject to being disclosed and to the person about whom a third-party communication notation has been made pursuant to section 6110(d)(1). Such notice shall be sent, by registered or certified mail, to the last known address of the persons described in this paragraph (c)(3) within 15 days after notice of the petition or complaint filed pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) is served on the Secretary. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall have the right to intervene in any action brought pursuant to section 6110(d)(3). If appropriate such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.
