                            <p class="depth0">This section establishes bond requirements for the lessee of an OCS  oil and gas or sulphur lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before BOEM will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of  an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner  for the lease must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that  guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain a $300,000 areawide bond that guarantees compliance  with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulphur  leases in the area where the lease is located; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain a lease or area wide bond in the amount required in  Sec.  556.53(a) or (b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The area  offshore the Atlantic Coast is included in the Gulf of Mexico. Areawide  bonds issued in the Gulf of Mexico will cover oil and gas or sulphur  operations offshore the Atlantic Coast. The three areas are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California,  Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security  instruments) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec.  556.53(a)  and (b) is satisfied if your operator provides a lease bond in the  required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and  conditions of the lease. Your operator may use an areawide bond under  this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or  alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's  remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is  reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section  for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is  reduced because of a default, or for any other reason, you must provide  additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under  this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the  Regional Director may direct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may pledge U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be  negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they  replace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you  must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of  bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional  Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the  required amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority  for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds when the  Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease  obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You may pledge alternative types of security instruments instead  of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the  alternative security protects the interests of the United States to the  same extent as the required bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you pledge an alternative type of security under this  paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value  falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you  must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities  pledged to the required amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you pledge an alternative type of security, you must include  authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the  proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to  satisfy any lease obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you fail to replace a deficient bond or to provide additional  bond coverage upon demand, the Regional Director may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assess penalties under part 550, subpart N of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspend production and other operations on your leases in  accordance with 30 CFR 250.173; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Initiate action to cancel your lease.</p>
