                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operator systems equipment is contained in Account 2220. It  includes all types of manual telephone switchboards except tandem  switchboards and those used solely for recording of calling telephone  numbers in connection with customer dialed charge traffic. It includes  all face equipment, terminating relay circuits of trunk and toll line  circuits, cord circuits, cable turning sections, subscriber line  equipment, associated toll connecting trunk equipment, number checking  facilities, ticket distributing systems, calculagraphs, chief operator  and other desks, operator chairs, and other such equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operator systems equipment is generally classified according to  operating arrangements of which the following are typical:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Separate toll boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Separate local manual boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Combined local manual and toll boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Combined toll and DSA boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Separate DSA and DSB boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Service observing boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Auxiliary service boards</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Traffic service positions</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If switchboards as set forth in Sec. 36.123(a) are of the key  pulsing type, the cost of the key pulsing senders, link and trunk finder  equipment is included with the switchboards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DSB boards include the associated DSB dial equipment, such as  link and sender equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Traffic service position systems include the common control and  trunk equipment in addition to the associated groups of positions  wherever located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2017, study areas  subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to Sec. 61.41 of this  chapter, shall assign the average balance of Account 2220, Operator  Systems, to the categories/subcategories, as specified in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section, based on the relative percentage assignment of  the average balance of Account 2220 to these categories/subcategories  during the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Effective July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2017, all study areas  shall apportion the costs assigned to the categories/subcategories, as  specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, among the jurisdictions  using the relative use measurements for the twelve month period ending  December 31, 2000 for each of the categories/subcategories specified in  paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The cost of the following operator systems equipment is  apportioned among the operations on the basis of the relative number of  weighted standard work seconds handled at the switchboards under  consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following types of switchboards at toll centers are  generally apportioned individually:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Separate toll boards. These usually include outward, through and  inward positions in separate lines and associated inward toll  switchboard positions in line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Switchboards handling both local and toll, either combined or  having segregated local and toll positions in the same line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Switchboards handling both toll and DSA, either combined or  having segregated toll and DSA positions in the same line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Traffic service positions, including separately located groups  of these positions when associated with a common basic control unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following types of switchboards at toll centers are  apportioned individually, or by groups of comparable types of boards for  each exchange:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Separate local manual boards. This includes the local positions  of manual boards where inward toll positions are in the same line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Separate DSA boards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Separate DSB boards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tributary boards may be treated individually if warranted or  they may be treated on a group basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Auxiliary service boards generally handle rate and route,  information, and intercept service at individual or joint positions. The  cost of these boards is apportioned as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of separate directory assistance boards is apportioned  among the operations on the basis of the relative number of weighted  standard work seconds handled at the boards under consideration.  Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds are apportioned  among the operations on the basis of the classification of these  weighted standard work seconds as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directory assistance weighted standard work seconds first are  classified between calls received over toll directory assistance trunks  from operators or customers and all other directory assistance calls.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The directory assistance weighted standard work seconds of each  type further are classified separately among the operations on the basis  of an analysis of a representative sample of directory assistance calls  of each type with reference to the locations of the calling and called  stations for each call.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of separate intercept boards and automated intercept  systems in the study area is apportioned among the operations on the  basis of the relative number of subscriber line minutes of use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cost of separate rate and route boards is generally included  with the cost of the toll boards served and is apportioned with those  boards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where more than one auxiliary service is handled at an auxiliary  board, the cost of the board is apportioned among the auxiliary services  on the basis of the relative number of weighted standard work seconds  for each service. The cost of that part of the board allocated to each  auxiliary service is apportioned among the operations in the same manner  as for a separate auxiliary board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The cost of joint exchange and toll service observing boards is  first apportioned between exchange and toll use on the basis of the  relative number of exchange and toll service observing units at these  boards. The cost of separate toll service observing boards and the toll  portion of joint service observing boards is apportioned between state  and interstate operations on the basis of the relative number of toll  minutes of use associated with the toll messages originating in the  offices observed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) investments are  apportioned as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operator position investments are apportioned on the basis of  the relative weighted standard work seconds for the entire TSPS complex.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remote trunk arrangement (RTA) investments are apportioned on  the basis of the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds)  required to process TSPS traffic originating from the end offices served  by each RTA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The remaining investments at the central control location, such  as the stored program control and memory, is apportioned on the basis of  the relative processor real time (i.e., actual seconds) for the entire  TSPS complex.
