                            <p class="depth0">An appeal to the Director is not required prior to filing an appeal  with the U.S. Court of Appeals for judicial review. An appeal may be  taken by the applicant, licensee, or permittee to the Director from a  decision resulting from a hearing under Sec. 555.73 or Sec. 555.75. An  appeal may also be taken by a Director, Industry Operations from a  decision resulting from a hearing under Sec. 555.75 as provided in  Sec. 555.76(b). The appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for  review on appeal with the Director within 15 days of the service of an  administrative law judge's decision or an order. The petition will set  forth facts tending to show (a) action of an arbitrary nature, (b)  action without reasonable warrant in fact, or (c) action contrary to law  and regulations. A copy of the petition will be filed with the Director,  Industry Operations or served on the applicant, licensee, or permittee,  as the case may be. In the event of appeal, the Director, Industry  Operations shall immediately forward the complete original record, by  certified mail, to the Director for his consideration, review, and  disposition as provided in subpart I of part 71 of this chapter. When,  on appeal, the Director affirms the initial decision of the Director,  Industry Operations or the administrative law judge, as the case may be,  the initial decision will be final.  [T.D. ATF-87, 46 FR 40384, Aug. 7, 1981, as amended by T.D. ATF 2013R- 9F, 79 FR 46694, Aug. 11, 2014]</p>
