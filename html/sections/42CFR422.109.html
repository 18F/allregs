                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The term significant cost, as it relates to a  particular NCD or legislative change in benefits, means either of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average cost of furnishing a single service exceeds a cost  threshold that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For calendar years 1998 and 1999, is $100,000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For calendar year 2000 and subsequent calendar years, is the  preceding year's dollar threshold adjusted to reflect the national per  capita growth percentage described in Sec. 422.308(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated cost of Medicare services furnished as a result of  a particular NCD or legislative change in benefits represents at least  0.1 percent of the national average per capita costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. If CMS determines and announces that an individual  NCD or legislative change in benefits meets the criteria for significant  cost described in paragraph (a) of this section, a MA organization is  not required to assume risk for the costs of that service or benefit  until the contract year for which payments are appropriately adjusted to  take into account the cost of the NCD service or legislative change in  benefits. If CMS determines that an NCD or legislative change in  benefits does not meet the ``significant cost'' threshold described in  Sec. 422.109(a), the MA organization is required to provide coverage for  the NCD or legislative change in benefits and assume risk for the costs  of that service or benefit as of the effective date stated in the NCD or  specified in the legislation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before payment adjustments become effective. Before the contract  year that payment adjustments that take into account the significant  cost of the NCD service or legislative change in benefits become  effective, the service or benefit is not included in the MA  organization's contract with CMS, and is not a covered benefit under the  contract. The following rules apply to these services or benefits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medicare payment for the service or benefit is made directly by  the fiscal intermediary and carrier to the provider furnishing the  service or benefit in accordance with original Medicare payment rules,  methods, and requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs for NCD services or legislative changes in benefits for  which CMS intermediaries and carriers will not make payment and are the  responsibility of the MA organization are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Services necessary to diagnose a condition covered by the NCD or  legislative changes in benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Most services furnished as follow-up care to the NCD service or  legislative change in benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any service that is already a Medicare-covered service and  included in the annual MA capitation rate or previously adjusted  payments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any services, including the costs of the NCD service or  legislative change in benefits, to the extent the MA organization is  already obligated to cover it as a supplemental benefit under  Sec. 422.102.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs for significant cost NCD services or legislative changes  in benefits for which CMS fiscal intermediaries and carriers will make  payment are those Medicare costs not listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)  through (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Beneficiaries are liable for any applicable coinsurance amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After payment adjustments become effective. For the contract  year in which payment adjustments that take into account the significant  cost of the NCD service or legislative change in benefits are in effect,  the service or   benefit is included in the MA organization's contract with CMS, and is a  covered benefit under the contract. Subject to all applicable rules  under this part, the MA organization must furnish, arrange, or pay for  the NCD service or legislative change in benefits. MA organizations may  establish separate plan rules for these services and benefits, subject  to CMS review and approval. CMS may, at its discretion, issue overriding  instructions limiting or revising the MA plan rules, depending on the  specific NCD or legislative change in benefits. For these services or  benefits, the Medicare enrollee will be responsible for MA plan cost  sharing, as approved by CMS or unless otherwise instructed by CMS.
