                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior approval requirement. Before engaging in any outside  employment, whether or not for compensation, an employee, other than a  special Government employee, must obtain the written approval of the  employee's immediate supervisor and the DAEO. Requests for approval  shall be forwarded through normal supervisory channels to the DAEO and  shall include the name of the person, group, or organization for whom  the work is to be performed; the type of work to be performed; and the  proposed hours of work and approximate dates of employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, approval will be granted only for each individual matter in  the course of practicing such profession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of employment. For purposes of this section,  ``employment'' means any form of non-Federal employment or business  relationship involving the provision of personal services by the  employee. It includes but is not limited to personal services as an  officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor,  general partner, trustee or teacher. It also includes writing when done  under an arrangement with another person for production or publication  of the written product. It does not, however, include participation in  the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional,  social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic  organization, unless such activities involve the provision of  professional services or advice or are for compensation other than  reimbursement of expenses.
