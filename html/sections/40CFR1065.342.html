                                Sec.  1065.342  Sample dryer verification.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. If you use a sample dryer as allowed in  Sec.  1065.145(e)(2) to remove water from the sample gas, verify the  performance upon installation, after major maintenance, for thermal  chiller. For osmotic membrane dryers, verify the performance upon  installation, after major maintenance, and within 35 days of testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement principles. Water can inhibit an analyzer's ability  to properly measure the exhaust component of interest and thus is  sometimes removed before the sample gas reaches the analyzer. For  example water can negatively interfere with a CLD's NOX  response through collisional quenching and can positively interfere with  an NDIR analyzer by causing a response similar to CO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System requirements. The sample dryer must meet the  specifications as determined in Sec.  1065.145(e)(2) for dewpoint,  Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, downstream of  the osmotic-membrane dryer or thermal chiller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sample dryer verification procedure. Use the following method to  determine sample dryer performance. Run this verification with the dryer  and associated sampling system operating in the same manner you will use  for emission testing (including operation of sample pumps). You may run  this verification test on multiple sample dryers sharing the same  sampling system at the same time. You may run this verification on the  sample dryer alone, but you must use the maximum gas flow rate expected  during testing. You may use good engineering judgment to develop a  different protocol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use PTFE or stainless steel tubing to make necessary  connections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidify room air, N2, or purified air by bubbling it  through distilled water in a sealed vessel that humidifies the gas to  the highest sample water content that you estimate during emission  sampling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Introduce the humidified gas upstream of the sample dryer. You  may disconnect the transfer line from the probe and introduce the  humidified gas at the inlet of the transfer line of the sample system  used during testing. You may use the sample pumps in the sample system  to draw gas through the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Maintain the sample lines, fittings, and valves from the  location where the humidified gas water content is measured to the inlet  of the sampling system at a temperature at least 5 [deg]C above the  local humidified gas dewpoint. For dryers used in NOX sample  systems, verify the sample system components used in this verification  prevent aqueous condensation as required in Sec.  1065.145(d)(1)(i). We  recommend that the sample system components be maintained at least 5  [deg]C above the local humidified gas dewpoint to prevent aqueous  condensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Measure the humidified gas dewpoint, Tdew, and  absolute pressure, ptotal, as close as possible to the inlet  of the sample dryer or inlet of the sample system to verify the water  content is at least as high as the highest value that you estimated  during emission sampling. You may verify the water content based on any  humidity parameter (e.g. mole fraction water, local dewpoint, or  absolute humidity).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Measure the humidified gas dewpoint, Tdew, and  absolute pressure, ptotal, as close as possible to the outlet  of the sample dryer. Note that the dewpoint changes with absolute  pressure. If the dewpoint at the sample dryer outlet is measured at a  different pressure, then this reading must be corrected to the dewpoint  at the sample dryer absolute pressure, ptotal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The sample dryer meets the verification if the dewpoint at the  sample dryer pressure as measured in paragraph (d)(6) of this section is  less than the dewpoint corresponding to the sample dryer specifications  as determined in Sec.  1065.145(e)(2) plus 2 [deg]C or if the mole  fraction of water as measured in (d)(6) is less than the corresponding  sample dryer specifications plus 0.002 mol/mol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternate sample dryer verification procedure. The following  method may   be used in place of the sample dryer verification procedure in (d) of  this section. If you use a humidity sensor for continuous monitoring of  dewpoint at the sample dryer outlet you may skip the performance check  in Sec.  1065.342(d), but you must make sure that the dryer outlet  humidity is at or below the minimum value used for quench, interference,  and compensation checks.
