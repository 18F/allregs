The Regional Administrator shall provide an Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/ram/default.htm. An Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF is not required for the return of unharvested GAF by NMFS to the IFQ permit holder's account from which it was derived, 15 calendar days prior to the closing of the commercial halibut fishing season for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application timing. The Regional Administrator will not approve any Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF before annual IFQ is issued for each year or after one month prior to the closing of the commercial fishing season for that year. Applications to transfer GAF to IFQ will be accepted from August 1 through August 31 only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transfer due to court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. NMFS may approve an Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF to return GAF to the IFQ permit holder's account from which it derived pursuant to a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notification of decision on application.

NMFS will notify applicants with incomplete applications of the specific information necessary to complete the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF approval criteria. An Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF will not be approved until the Regional Administrator has determined that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The person applying to transfer IFQ to GAF or receive IFQ from a transfer of GAF to IFQ:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Possesses at least one unit of halibut quota share (QS), as defined in Sec. 679.2 of this title, in the applicable Commission regulatory area, either Area 2C or Area 3A, for which the transfer of IFQ to GAF is requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has been issued an annual IFQ Permit, as defined in Sec. 679.4(d)(1) of this title, for the Commission regulatory area corresponding to the person's QS holding, either Area 2C or Area 3A, resulting from that halibut QS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has an IFQ permit holder's account with an IFQ amount equal to or greater than amount of IFQ to be transferred in the Commission regulatory area, either Area 2C or Area 3A, for which the transfer of IFQ to GAF is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person applying to receive or transfer GAF possesses a valid charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit in the Commission regulatory area (Area 2C or Area 3A) that corresponds to the IFQ permit area from or to which the IFQ will be transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a transfer of IFQ to GAF:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer between IFQ and GAF must not cause the GAF permit issued to exceed the GAF use limits in paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(H)(1) and (2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transfer must not cause the person applying to transfer IFQ to exceed the GAF use limit in paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(H)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There must be no fines, civil penalties, sanctions, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal fishery violations involving either person or permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a Community Quota Entity (CQE), as defined in Sec. 679.2 of this title, submits a ``Community Quota Entity Application for Transfer Between Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) and Guided Angler Fish (GAF),'' the application will not be approved until the Regional Administrator has determined that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The CQE applying to transfer IFQ to GAF is eligible to hold IFQ on behalf of the eligible community in Commission regulatory area 2C or 3A designated in Table 21 to 50 CFR part 679;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The CQE applying to transfer IFQ to GAF has received notification of approval of eligibility to receive IFQ for that community as described in Sec. 679.41(d)(1) of this title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The CQE applying to receive GAF from a Commission regulatory area 2C or 3A IFQ permit holder holds one or more charter halibut permits or community charter halibut permits for the corresponding area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The CQE applying to transfer between IFQ and GAF has submitted a complete annual report(s) as required by Sec. 679.5(t) of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Conversion between IFQ and GAF--(1) General. An annual conversion factor will be calculated to convert between net pounds (whole number, no decimal points) of halibut IFQ and number(s) of GAF (whole number, no decimal points) for Area 2C and Area 3A. This conversion factor will be posted on the NMFS Alaska Region Web

site before the beginning of each commercial halibut fishing season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conversion calculation. The net pounds of IFQ transferred to or from an IFQ permit holder in Commission regulatory area 2C or 3A will be equal to the number(s) of GAF transferred to or from the GAF account of a GAF permit holder in the corresponding area, multiplied by the estimated average net weight determined as follows. For the first calendar year after the effective date of this rule, the average net weight will be estimated for all halibut harvested by charter vessel anglers during the most recent year without a size limit in effect. After the first calendar year after the effective date of this rule, the average net weight will be estimated from the average length of GAF retained in that area during the previous year as reported to RAM via the GAF electronic reporting system. If no GAF were harvested in a year, the conversion factor will be calculated using the same method as for the first calendar year after the effective date of this rule. NMFS will round up to the nearest whole number (no decimals) when transferring IFQ to GAF and when transferring GAF to IFQ. Expressed algebraically, the conversion formula is:</p><p class="depth0">IFQ net pounds = (number of GAF x average net weight).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The total number of net pounds converted from unharvested GAF and transferred to the IFQ permit holder's account from which it derived cannot exceed the total number of net pounds NMFS transferred from the IFQ permit holder's account to the GAF permit holder's account for that area in the current year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Guided Angler Fish (GAF) permit--(A) General. (1) A GAF permit authorizes a charter vessel angler to catch and retain GAF in the specified Commission regulatory area, subject to the limits in paragraphs (c)(5)(iv)(A) through (K) of this section, during a charter vessel fishing trip authorized by the charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit that is designated on the GAF permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A GAF permit authorizes a charter vessel angler to catch and retain GAF in the specified Commission regulatory area from the time of permit issuance until any of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of GAF in the GAF permit holder's account is zero;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permit expires at 11:59 p.m. (Alaska local time) on the day prior to 15 days prior to the end of the commercial halibut fishing season for that year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NMFS replaces the GAF permit with a modified GAF permit following NMFS approval of an Application for Transfer Between IFQ and GAF; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The GAF permit is revoked or suspended under 15 CFR part 904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A GAF permit is issued for use in a Commission regulatory area (2C or 3A) to the person who holds a valid charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit in the corresponding Commission regulatory area. Regulations governing issuance, transfer, and use of charter halibut permits are located in Sec. 300.67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A GAF permit is assigned to only one charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit held by the GAF permit holder in the corresponding Commission regulatory area (2C or 3A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If a charter vessel angler harvests GAF from a charter vessel with a charter vessel guide on board, a legible copy of a valid GAF permit and the assigned charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit appropriate for the Commission regulatory area (2C or 3A) must be carried by the charter vessel operator on board the charter vessel used to harvest GAF at all times that such fish are retained on board and must be presented for inspection on request of any authorized officer. If a charter vessel angler harvests GAF from a charter vessel without a charter vessel guide on board, the charter vessel guide must retain the legible copy of the GAF permit and the assigned charter halibut permit, community charter halibut permit, or military charter halibut permit must be on the charter vessel with the charter vessel angler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No person may alter, erase, mutilate, or forge a GAF permit or document issued under this section (Sec. 300.65(c)(5)(iii)).
