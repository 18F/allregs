                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party desiring to seek review, including judicial review, of  a decision of the administrative law judge, or a named person alleging  that the complaint was frivolous or brought in bad faith who seeks an  award of attorney's fees, must file a written petition for review with  the Administrative Review Board (``the Board''), which has been  delegated the authority to act for the Secretary and issue final  decisions under this part. The decision of the administrative law judge  shall become the final order of the Secretary unless, pursuant to this  section, a petition for review is timely filed with the Board. The  petition for review must specifically identify the findings, conclusions  or orders to which exception is taken. Any exception not specifically  urged ordinarily shall be deemed to have been waived by the parties. To  be effective, a petition must be filed within ten business days of the  date of the decision of the administrative law judge. The date of the  postmark, facsimile transmittal, or e-mail communication will be  considered to be the date of filing; if the petition is filed in person,  by hand-delivery or other means, the petition is considered filed upon  receipt. The petition must be served on all parties and on the Chief  Administrative Law Judge at the time it is filed with the Board. Copies  of the petition for review and all briefs must be served on the  Assistant Secretary, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and  on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor Standards, U.S.  Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a timely petition for review is filed pursuant to paragraph  (a) of this section, the decision of the administrative law judge shall  become the final order of the Secretary unless the Board, within 30 days  of the filing of the petition, issues an order notifying the parties  that the case has been accepted for review. If a case is accepted for  review, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be  inoperative unless and until the Board issues an order adopting the  decision, except   that a preliminary order of reinstatement shall be effective while  review is conducted by the Board. The Board will specify the terms under  which any briefs are to be filed. The Board will review the factual  determinations of the administrative law judge under the substantial  evidence standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final decision of the Board shall be issued within 120 days  of the conclusion of the hearing, which shall be deemed to be the  conclusion of all proceedings before the administrative law judge--i.e.,  ten business days after the date of the decision of the administrative  law judge unless a motion for reconsideration has been filed with the  administrative law judge in the interim. The decision will be served  upon all parties and the Chief Administrative Law Judge by mail to the  last known address. The final decision will also be served on the  Assistant Secretary, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and  on the Associate Solicitor, Division of Fair Labor Standards, U.S.  Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, even if the Assistant  Secretary is not a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Board concludes that the party charged has violated the  law, the final order shall order the party charged to take appropriate  affirmative action to abate the violation, including, where appropriate,  reinstatement of the complainant to that person's former position,  together with the compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions,  and privileges of that employment, and compensatory damages. At the  request of the complainant, the Board shall assess against the named  person all costs and expenses (including attorney's and expert witness  fees) reasonably incurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Board determines that the named person has not violated  the law, an order shall be issued denying the complaint. If, upon the  request of the named person, the Board determines that a complaint was  frivolous or was brought in bad faith, the Board may award to the named  person a reasonable attorney's fee, not exceeding $1,000.</p>
