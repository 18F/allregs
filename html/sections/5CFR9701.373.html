                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a pay system is established under this subpart and applied  to a category of employees, DHS must convert employees to the system  without a reduction in their rate of pay (including basic pay and any  applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate under 5  U.S.C. 5305, locality rate supplement under Sec. 9701.332, or special  rate supplement under Sec. 9701.333).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an employee receiving a special rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305  before conversion is converted to an equal rate of pay under the DHS pay  system that consists of a basic rate and a locality or special rate  supplement, the conversion will not be considered as resulting in a  reduction in basic pay for the purpose of applying subpart F of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If another personnel action (e.g., promotion, geographic  movement) takes effect on the same day as the effective date of an  employee's conversion to the new pay system, DHS must process the other  action under the rules pertaining to the employee's former system before  processing the conversion action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee on a temporary promotion at the time of conversion  must be returned to his or her official position of record prior to  processing the conversion. If the employee is temporarily promoted  immediately after the conversion, pay must be set under the rules for  promotion increases under the DHS system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Secretary has discretion to make one-time pay adjustments  for GS and prevailing rate employees when they are converted to the DHS  pay system. DHS will issue implementing directives governing any such  pay adjustment, including rules governing employee eligibility, pay  computations, and the timing of any such pay adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Secretary has discretion to convert entry/developmental  employees in noncompetitive career ladder paths to the pay progression  plan established for the Entry/Developmental band to which the employee  is assigned under the DHS pay system. DHS will issue implementing  directives governing any such conversion, including rules governing  employee eligibility, pay computations, and the timing of any such  conversion. As provided in paragraph (a) of this section, DHS must  convert employees without a reduction in their rate of pay.</p>
