Vacancy payments under the HAP contract will not be made unless the conditions for receipt of these housing assistance payments set forth in this section are fulfilled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vacancies during rent-up. For each unit that is not leased as of the effective date of the HAP contract, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy, if the Borrower:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complied with Sec. 891.600;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vacancies after rent-up. If an eligible family vacates a unit, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy if the Borrower:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifies that it did not cause the vacancy by violating the lease, the HAP contract, or any applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy immediately upon learning of the vacancy or prospective vacancy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in Sec. 891.600(a)(2) and (3), and in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any vacancy resulting from the Borrower's eviction of an eligible family, certifies that it has complied with Sec. 891.630.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vacancies for longer than 60 days. If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Borrower may apply to receive additional vacancy payments in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt service attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months for the unit if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payment is claimed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Borrower has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HUD that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the period of vacancy, the project is not providing the Borrower with revenues at least equal to project expenses (exclusive of depreciation) and the amount of payments requested is not more than the portion of the deficiency attributable to the vacant unit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies. If the Borrower collects payments for vacancies from other sources (tenant rent, security deposits, payments under Sec. 891.435(c), or governmental payments under other programs), the Borrower shall not be entitled to collect vacancy payments to the extent these collections from other sources plus the vacancy payment exceed contract rent.
