                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an incomplete vehicle manufacturer assumes legal  responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed on manufacturers  by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended (49  U.S.C. chapter 301) (hereafter referred to as the Act), with respect to  a vehicle as finally manufactured, the requirements of Sec. Sec. 568.4,  568.5 and 568.6 do not apply to that vehicle. In such a case, the  incomplete vehicle manufacturer shall ensure that a label is affixed to  the final vehicle in conformity with 49 CFR 567.5(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an intermediate manufacturer of a vehicle assumes legal  responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed on manufacturers  by the Vehicle Safety Act, with respect to the vehicle as finally  manufactured, Sec. Sec. 568.5 and 568.6 do not apply to that vehicle.  In such a case, the intermediate manufacturer shall ensure that a label  is affixed to the final vehicle in conformity with 49 CFR 567.5(g). The  assumption of responsibility by an intermediate manufacturer does not,  however, change the requirements for incomplete vehicle manufacturers in  Sec. 568.4.</p>
