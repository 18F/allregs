                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you do not become entitled to benefits at the time you reach  age 62, we adjust the guaranteed alternative computed for you under  Sec. 404.232 as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the primary insurance amount computed under the guaranteed  alternative, we apply any automatic cost-of-living or ad hoc increases  in primary insurance amounts that go into effect in the year you reach  age 62 and in years up through the year you become entitled to benefits.  (See appendix VI for a list of the percentage increases in primary  insurance amounts since December 1978.)</p><p class="depth2">Example: Mr. C reaches age 62 in January 1981 and becomes entitled  to old-age insurance benefits in April 1981. He had no social security  earnings before 1951 and his year-by-year social security earnings after  1950 are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Year                               Earnings ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1951.......................................................       $3,600 1952.......................................................        3,600 1953.......................................................        3,600 1954.......................................................        3,600 1955.......................................................        4,200 1956.......................................................        4,200 1957.......................................................        4,200 1958.......................................................        4,200 1959.......................................................        4,800 1960.......................................................        4,800 1961.......................................................        4,800 1962.......................................................        4,800 1963.......................................................        4,800 1964.......................................................        4,800 1965.......................................................        4,800 1966.......................................................        6,600 1967.......................................................        6,600 1968.......................................................        7,800 1969.......................................................        7,800 1970.......................................................        7,800 1971.......................................................        7,800 1972.......................................................        9,000 1973.......................................................       10,800 1974.......................................................       13,200 1975.......................................................       14,100 1976.......................................................       15,300 1977.......................................................       16,500 1978.......................................................       17,700 1979.......................................................       22,900 1980.......................................................       25,900 1981.......................................................       29,700 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Mr. C's elapsed years are the 30 years 1951 through 1980. We  subtract 5 from his 30 elapsed years to find that we must use 25 benefit  computation years in computing his average monthly wage. His computation  base years are 1951 through 1980 which are years after 1950 up to the  year he reached age 62. We will use his 25 computation base years with  the highest earnings to compute his average monthly wage. Thus, we  exclude the years 1951-1955. The year 1981 is not a base year for this  computation.</p><p class="depth2">We total his earnings in his benefit computation years and get  $236,000. We then divide by the 300 months in his 25 benefit computation  years, and find his average monthly wage to be $786.66 which is rounded  down to $786.</p><p class="depth2">The primary insurance amount in the benefit table in appendix III  that corresponds to Mr. C's average monthly wage is $521.70. The 9.9  percent and 14.3 percent cost of living increase for 1979 and 1980,  respectively, are not applicable because Mr. C reached age 62 in 1981.</p><p class="depth2">The average indexed monthly earnings method described in  Secs. 404.210 through 404.212 considers all of the earnings after 1950,  including 1981 earnings which, in Mr. C's case cannot be used in the  guaranteed alternative method. Mr. C's primary insurance amount under  the average indexed earnings method is $548.40. Therefore, his benefit  is based upon the $548.40 primary insurance amount. As in the guaranteed  alternative method, Mr. C is not entitled to the cost of living  increases for years before the year he reaches age 62.</p><p class="depth2">Old-Start Method of Computing Primary Insurance Amounts</p>
