                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adjustment process. To implement a framework adjustment for the Skate FMP, the Council shall develop and analyze proposed actions over the span of at least two Council meetings (the initial meeting agenda must include notification of the impending proposal for a framework adjustment) and provide advance public notice of the availability of both the proposals and the analyses. Opportunity to provide written and oral comments shall be provided throughout the process before the Council submits its recommendations to the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Council review and analyses. In response to the annual review, or at any other time, the Council may initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Skate FMP. After a framework action has been initiated, the Council shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions within the scope of measures specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The Council shall publish notice of its intent to take action and provide the public with any relevant analyses and opportunity to comment on any possible actions. Documentation and analyses for the framework adjustment shall be available at least 1 week before the final meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Council recommendation. After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council may make a recommendation to the Regional Administrator. The Council's recommendation shall include supporting rationale, an analysis of impacts required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the framework measures should be issued directly as a final rule, without opportunity for public notice and comment, the Council shall consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Regional Administrator may publish the recommended framework measures in the Federal Register. If the Council's recommendation is first published as a proposed rule and the Regional Administrator concurs with the Council's recommendation after receiving additional public comment, the measures shall then be published as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Regional Administrator approves the Council's recommendations, the Secretary may, for good cause found under the standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, waive the requirement for a proposed rule and opportunity for public comment in the Federal Register. The Secretary, in so doing, shall publish only the final rule. Submission of recommendations does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for prior notice and comment in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Regional Administrator may approve, disapprove, or partially approve the Council's recommendation. If the Regional Administrator does not approve the Council's specific recommendation, the Regional Administrator must notify the Council in writing of the reasons for the action prior to the first Council meeting following publication of such decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible framework adjustment measures. Measures that may be changed or implemented through framework action, provided that any corresponding management adjustments can also be implemented through a framework adjustment, include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Skate permitting and reporting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Skate overfishing definitions and related targets and thresholds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prohibitions on possession and/or landing of individual skate species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Skate possession limits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Skate closed areas (and consideration of exempted gears and fisheries);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Seasonal skate fishery restrictions and specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Target TACs for individual skate species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Hard TACs/quotas for skates, including species-specific quotas, fishery quotas, and/or quotas for non-directed fisheries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Establishment of a mechanism for TAC set-asides to conduct scientific research, or for other reasons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Onboard observer requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Gear modifications, requirements, restrictions, and/or prohibitions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Minimum and/or maximum sizes for skates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Adjustments to exemption area requirements, area coordinates, and/or management lines established by the FMP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Measures to address protected species issues, if necessary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Description and identification of EFH;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Description and identification of habitat areas of particular concern;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Measures to protect EFH;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> OY and/or MSY specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Changes to the accountability measures described at Sec. 648.323;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Changes to TAL allocation proportions to the skate wing and bait fisheries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Changes to seasonal quotas in the skate bait or wing fisheries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Reduction of the baseline 25-percent ACL-ACT buffer to less than 25 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> Changes to catch monitoring procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(24)</em> Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
