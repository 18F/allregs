                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direct identification manufacturing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records required. Each  manufacturer or producer under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) shall keep records to  allow the verifying Customs official to trace all articles manufactured  or produced for exportation or destruction with drawback, from  importation, through production, to exportation or destruction. To this  end, these records shall specifically establish:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The quantity and identity of the imported duty-paid merchandise  or drawback products used in or appearing in (see Sec. 191.23) the  articles manufactured or produced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The quantity, if any, of the nondrawback merchandise used,  when these records are necessary to determine the quantity of imported  duty-paid merchandise or drawback product used in the manufacture or  production of the exported or destroyed articles or appearing in them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The quantity and description of the articles manufactured or  produced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The quantity of waste incurred, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> That the finished articles on which drawback is claimed were  exported or destroyed within 5 years after the importation of the duty- paid merchandise, without having been used in the United States prior to  such exportation or destruction. (If the completed articles were  commingled after manufacture, their identity may be maintained in the  manner prescribed in Sec. 191.14 of this part.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accounting. The merchandise and articles to be exported or  destroyed shall be accounted for in a manner which will enable the  manufacturer, producer, or claimant:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To determine, and the Customs official to verify, the applicable  import entry, certificate of delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture  and delivery associated with the claim; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To identify with respect to that import entry, certificate of  delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture and delivery, the imported  duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in manufacture or  production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> shall establish the facts in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (iv)  through (vi) of this section, and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The quantity, identity, and specifications of the merchandise  designated (imported duty-paid, or drawback product);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The quantity, identity, and specifications of merchandise of the  same kind and quality as the designated merchandise before its use to  manufacture or produce (or appearing in) the exported or destroyed  articles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise  at its plant, the manufacturer or producer used it in manufacturing or  production and that during the same 3-year period it manufactured or  produced the exported or destroyed articles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the designated merchandise is a chemical element that was  contained in imported material that was subject to an ad valorem rate of  duty, and a substitution drawback claim is made based on that chemical  element:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The duty paid on the imported material must be apportioned among  its constituent components. The claim on the chemical element that is  the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to  that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure  set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)  that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a  compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity  of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory  analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the  percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to  establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the  pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the  constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their  respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against  the above-determined amount of pure compound.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount claimed as drawback based on the chemical element  must be deducted from the duty paid on the imported material that may be  claimed on any other drawback claim.</p><p class="depth4">Example to paragraph (b)(4): Synthetic rutile that is shown by  appropriate analysis in the entry papers to be 91.7% pure titanium  dioxide is imported and dutiable at a 5% ad valorem duty rate. The  amount of imported synthetic rutile is 30,000 pounds with an entered  value of $12,000. The total duty paid is $600. Titanium in the synthetic  rutile is designated as the basis for a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C.  1313(b). The amount of titanium dioxide in the synthetic rutile is  determined by converting the purity percentage (91.7%) to its decimal  equivalent (.917) and multiplying the entered amount of synthetic rutile  (30,000 pounds) by that decimal equivalent (.917 x 30,000 = 27,510  pounds of titanium dioxide contained in the 30,000 pounds of imported  synthetic rutile). The titanium, based on atomic weight, represents  59.93% of the constituents in titanium dioxide. Multiplying that  percentage, converted to its decimal equivalent, by the amount of  titanium dioxide determines the titanium content of the imported  synthetic rutile (.5993 x 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide = 16,486.7  pounds of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile).  Therefore, up to 16,486.7 pounds of titanium is available to be  designated as the basis for drawback. As the per-unit duty paid on the  synthetic rutile is calculated by dividing the duty paid ($600) by the  amount of imported synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds), the per-unit duty  is two cents of duty per pound of the imported synthetic rutile ($600 /  30,000 = $0.02). The duty on the titanium is calculated by multiplying  the amount of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile by two  cents of duty per pound (16,486.7 x $0.02 = $329.73 duty apportioned to  the titanium). The product is then multiplied by 99% to determine the  maximum amount of drawback available ($329.73 x .99=$326.44). If an  exported titanium alloy ingot weighs 17,000 pounds, in which 16,000  pounds of titanium was used to make the ingot, drawback is determined by  multiplying the duty per pound ($0.02) by the weight of the titanium  contained in the ingot (16,000 pounds) to calculate the duty available  for drawback ($0.02 x 16,000 = $320.00). Because only 99% of the duty  can be claimed, drawback is determined by multiplying this available  duty amount by 99% (.99 x $320.00 = $316.80). As the oxygen content of  the titanium dioxide is 45% of the synthetic rutile, if oxygen is the  designated merchandise on another drawback claim, 45% of the duty  claimed on the synthetic rutile would be available for drawback based on  the substitution of oxygen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Valuable waste records. When waste has a value and the  manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on  the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the  articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer shall keep  records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture  or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity  and market value of the waste incurred (see Sec. 191.2(u) of this  part). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or  designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b),  respectively, shall be based on the quantity of merchandise actually  used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The  waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the  quantity of merchandise actually used the amount of merchandise which  the value of the waste would replace.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Purchase of manufactured articles for exportation. Where the  claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer and exports them, the  claimant shall file the related certificate of manufacture and delivery  as part of the claim (see Sec. 191.51(a)(1) of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple claimants--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Multiple claimants may file for  drawback with respect to the same export (for example, if an automobile  is exported, where different parts of the automobile have been produced  by different manufacturers under drawback conditions and the exporter  waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the  manufacturers under Sec. 191.82 of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submission of letter. Each drawback claimant  shall file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the  component article on the export bill of lading to which each claim will  relate. Each letter shall show the name of the claimant and bear a  statement that the claim shall be limited to its respective component  article. The exporter shall endorse the letters, as required, to show  the respective interests of the claimants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Blanket waivers and assignments of drawback rights. Exporters  may waive and assign their drawback rights for all, or any portion, of  their exportations with respect to a particular commodity for a given  period to a drawback claimant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use of export summary procedure. If the parties elect to use  the export summary procedure (Sec. 191.73 of this part) each drawback  claimant shall complete a chronological summary of exports for the  respective component product to which each claim will relate. Each  claimant shall identify in the chronological summary the name of the  other claimant(s) and the component product for which each will  independently claim drawback, if known at the time the drawback claim is  filed. The exporter shall endorse the summaries, as required, to show  the respective interests of the claimants. Each claimant shall have on  file and make available to Customs upon request, the endorsement from  the exporter assigning the right to claim drawback.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retention of records. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all  records required to be kept by the manufacturer, producer, or claimant  with respect to drawback claims, and records kept by others to  complement the records of the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with  respect to drawback claims shall be retained for 3 years after the date  of payment of the related claims (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records  may be subject to a different retention period for different purposes).
