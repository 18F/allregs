                            <p class="depth0">A certificate holder may schedule and a flightcrew member may accept  up to five consecutive flight duty periods that infringe on the window  of circadian low if the certificate holder provides the flightcrew  member with an opportunity to rest in a suitable accommodation during  each of the consecutive nighttime flight duty periods. The rest  opportunity must be at least 2 hours, measured from the time that the  flightcrew member reaches the suitable accommodation, and must comply  with the conditions specified in Sec. 117.15(a), (c), (d), and (e).  Otherwise, no certificate holder may schedule and no flightcrew member  may accept more than three consecutive flight duty periods that infringe  on the window of circadian low. For purposes of this section, any split  duty rest that is provided in accordance with Sec. 117.15 counts as  part of a flight duty period.</p>
