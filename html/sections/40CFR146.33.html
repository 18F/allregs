                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operating requirements. Operating requirements prescribed shall,  at a minimum, specify that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except during well stimulation injection pressure at the  wellhead shall be calculated so as to assure that the pressure in the  injection zone during injection does not initiate new fractures or  propagate existing fractures in the injection zone. In no case, shall  injection pressure initiate fractures in the confining zone or cause the  migration of injection or formation fluids into an underground source of  drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Injection between the outermost casing protecting underground  sources of drinking water and the well bore is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring requirements. Monitoring requirements shall, at a  minimum, specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring of the nature of injected fluids with sufficient  frequency to yield representative data on its characteristics. Whenever  the injection fluid is modified to the extent that the analysis required  by Sec.  146.34(a)(7)(iii) is incorrect or incomplete, a new analysis as  required by Sec.  146.34(a)(7)(iii) shall be provided to the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring of injection pressure and either flow rate or volume  semi-monthly, or metering and daily recording of injected and produced  fluid volumes as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstration of mechanical integrity pursuant to Sec.  146.08  at least once every five years during the life of the well for salt  solution mining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring of the fluid level in the injection zone semi- monthly, where appropriate and monitoring of the parameters chosen to  measure water quality in the monitoring wells required by Sec.   146.32(e), semi-monthly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Quarterly monitoring of wells required by Sec.  146.32(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All Class III wells may be monitored on a field or project basis  rather than an individual well basis by manifold monitoring. Manifold  monitoring may be used in cases of facilities consisting of more than  one injection well, operating with a common manifold. Separate  monitoring systems for each well are not required provided the   owner/operator demonstrates that manifold monitoring is comparable to  individual well monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements. Reporting requirements shall, at a  minimum, include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quarterly reporting to the Director on required monitoring;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Results of mechanical integrity and any other periodic test  required by the Director reported with the first regular quarterly  report after the completion of the test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring may be reported on a project or field basis rather  than individual well basis where manifold monitoring is used.
