Such procedures should recognize that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equipment, spares, stores items, and materials peculiar to a plant should be retained for possible future operation of the plant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where practicable, common-use stores should be removed and used elsewhere; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uninstalled equipment and other personal property not required should be utilized elsewhere on-site or be disposed of as excess.</p>
