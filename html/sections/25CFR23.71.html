The chief tribal enrollment officer of the BIA is authorized to

disclose enrollment information relating to an adopted Indian child where the biological parents have by affidavit requested anonymity. In such cases, the chief tribal enrollment officer shall certify the child's tribe, and, where the information warrants, that the child's parentage and other circumstances entitle the child to enrollment consideration under the criteria established by the tribe.</p>
