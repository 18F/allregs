The pilot in command must review for accuracy and comply with the performance plan on the day the flight is flown. The performance plan must be based on the information in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for that helicopter, taking into consideration the maximum density altitude for which the operation is planned, in order to determine:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum gross weight and center of gravity (CG) limitations for hovering in ground effect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maximum gross weight and CG limitations for hovering out of ground effect; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maximum combination of weight, altitude, and temperature for which height/velocity information in the RFM is valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except for the approach to and transition from a hover for the purpose of takeoff and landing, or during takeoff and landing, the pilot in command must make a reasonable plan to operate the helicopter outside of the caution/warning/avoid area of the limiting height/velocity diagram.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for the approach to and transition from a hover for the purpose of takeoff and landing, during takeoff and landing, or when necessary for safety of flight, the pilot in command must operate the helicopter in compliance with the plan described in paragraph (b) of this section.
