                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where events require the State or local governments of the  affected metropolitan area to provide protection to meet an  extraordinary protective need otherwise qualifying for reimbursement,  such reimbursement may be made even if the provisions of Sec. Sec. 13.4  and 13.5 have not been complied with fully. In such circumstances the  provisions of Sec. 13.6 shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases where State or local governments, or both, utilized  their own services, personnel, equipment, and facilities to provide  protection for an extraordinary protective need, and no request for  protective assistance pursuant to Sec. 13.4 was made because the  extraordinary protective need occurred prior to the promulgation of this  part but after July 1, 1974, an application by such government to the  Assistant Secretary for reimbursement otherwise conforming to the  requirements of this part will be considered.
