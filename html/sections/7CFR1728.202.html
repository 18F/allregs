                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This specification describes in more detail the responsibilities and procedures pertaining to quality control for crossarms, as specified in Sec. 1728.201 of this part, and poles, covered in Bulletin 1728F-700, ``Specification for Wood Poles, Stubs and Anchor Logs,'' incorporated by reference in Sec. 1728.97 of this part and in Sec. 1755.97 of 7 CFR part 1755.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General stipulations. (1) Conformance of poles and crossarms to agency specifications for the most part is the responsibility of the producer's management.</p><p class="depth0">A member of the producer's staff shall be designated quality control designee and charged with the responsibility for the exercise of proper quality control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of AWPA M3-05 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1728.97), covering records, adequate laboratory, plant gauges, and other plant facilities including proper storage, shall be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methods of inspection described in this section shall be used no matter which plan timber products are purchased under, i.e., Insured Warranty Plan, Independent Inspection Plan, or Quality Assurance Plans, as described in Sec. 1728.201 of this part or Bulletin 1728F-700 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1728.97). The number of poles and crossarms actually inspected by monitors for quality control under a Quality Assurance Plan or the Insured Warranty Plan may vary from the number of poles and crossarms inspected under the Independent Inspection Plan. Under the Independent Inspection Plan, each pole and a sample number of crossarms shall be inspected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Under the Independent Inspection Plan, the borrower should designate in the purchase order which inspection agency it has selected. Unless the borrower contracts for inspection as a separate transaction, the treating company shall obtain the services of the borrower's designated inspection agency. For reserve treated stock for purchase under the Independent Inspection Plan, the treating company shall obtain the services of an inspection agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Individual inspectors in the employ of Independent Inspection Agencies shall be experienced and competent. The inspector shall perform all phases of the inspection personally and in the proper sequence. The primary responsibility of the inspector is to determine, for the borrower, by careful inspection and verification, that the timber products, preservative, and treatment meet the requirements of Bulletins 1728F-700 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1728.97) and Sec. 1728.201 of this part (Bulletin 1728H-701) and that the methods, storage facilities, and production equipment conform to applicable specifications. For details of the inspector's qualifications see Appendix A of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Independent inspection agencies and inspectors shall maintain their impartiality. To do so, inspection agencies, inspectors, producers and brokers must maintain the greatest degree of separation and eliminate even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Inspection agencies shall not receive gratuities from or enter into financial agreements, other than for inspection services, with suppliers for which they perform inspection. Inspection agencies shall not provide gratuities or free services to suppliers. Inspection agencies shall not offer product warranties on inspected material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure of an individual inspector to follow proper procedures or failure of an inspection agency to properly train and supervise inspectors or follow the appropriate RUS specifications

constitutes grounds for RUS debarment of said company from future inspection of RUS financed material</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Inspection agencies shall have and maintain liability insurance in the amount of $500,000 and a surety bond or miscellaneous errors and omission insurance for consequential damages for not less than $250,000. Upon request, evidence of compliance to this requirement shall be forwarded to the agency. The evidence shall be in the form of a certificate of insurance or a Bond signed by a representative of the insurance or Surety Bonding company and include a provision that no change in, or cancellation of, will be made without the prior written notice to Chairman, Technical Standards Committee ``A'' (Electric).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Inspection agencies shall maintain their own laboratory that is properly equipped, and capable of completely analyzing the respective preservatives and retentions, and at a minimum able to run referee methods. This laboratory shall be independent from any treating plant laboratory. Independent Inspection Agencies may use one central laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Laminated materials manufactured for use on borrower systems shall comply with manufacturing and quality control requirements specified in ANSI O5.2 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 1728.97). The product shall be marked and certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Laminated material shall be inspected in accordance with ANSI O5.2, (incorporated by reference in Sec. 1728.97).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Quality control of material shall be performed to determine conformance with Sec. 1728.201 of this part and AITC 200, (incorporated by reference in Sec. 1728.97).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Quality control and inspection procedures for product acceptance. It is the responsibility of the plant quality control designee to perform the following procedures to ensure that a particular lot of material conforms to the requirements of the applicable Agency specification prior to treatment. After the plant quality control designee has performed these procedures, a particular lot of material shall be released to the inspector for verification of conformance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Poles can be purchased under any of the three purchase plans. These plans are Insured Warranty Plan, Independent Inspection Plan, or a Quality Assurance Plan. Under all of these plans, all poles in a lot shall be inspected by the plant quality control designee.</p><p class="depth0">Under the Insured Warranty Plan and a Quality Assurance Plan, the number of poles inspected by a third party inspector may be less than every pole, depending on the terms of the plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ample space and assistance shall be provided by the treating plant for handling and turning to ensure that the surfaces of all items can be adequately inspected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the Independent Inspection Plan, all poles shall be inspected by the Independent Inspector for conformance to the requirements of Bulletin 1728F-700 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1728.97). If a pole is rejected and the cause of rejection is corrected, the rejected pole may be offered again for inspection as new material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dimensions, length, and circumference shall be measured by a standard steel tape to determine that they are in agreement with the details for class and length in the brand and butt stamp. If it is obvious by visual comparison with a measured pole that the brand information is correct, individual poles need not be measured. Pole circumference dimensions made prior to treatment shall govern acceptance. Reduction in dimension due to treatment and shipping shall be not more than 2 percent below the minimum for the pole class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If 5 percent of the poles in a lot offered for inspection are defective, the inspector shall terminate the inspection. Re-examination of an entire lot by plant quality control shall be required when the number of rejected poles equals or exceeds 5 percent of the lot inspected. All defective or nonconforming poles either shall be removed from the lot or have their brands marked out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Poles in a lot shall be inspected for decay and all poles shall be of the same seasoning condition. If the plant quality control designee suspects that decay is present, a slice from both ends shall be cut for closer examination. If 3

percent of the inspected poles in a lot show evidence of decay, the entire lot shall be unconditionally rejected without further sorting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Moisture content, when limited by the purchaser, as stated on the purchaser's purchase order, shall be measured by calibrated electronic moisture meter. Calibration of the meter shall include not only the zero settings for the X and Y readings, but also two resistance standards for 12 and 22 percent moisture content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Material failing to conform for moisture content may be retested upon request after a recalibration of the instrument. The results of the second test shall govern disposition of the lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Re-examination for any mechanical damage or deterioration and for original acceptance shall be conducted on timber products not treated within 10 days after original inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Crossarms can be purchased only under either of two purchase plans. These plans are the Independent Inspection Plan or Quality Assurance Plans. Under the Independent Inspection Plan, crossarms are to be inspected prior to manufacture, during manufacture, and after treatment. Under a Quality Assurance Plan, crossarms are inspected according to the terms of the quality assurance program acceptable to Rural Utilities Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inspection prior to treatment shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Surface inspection of all ends of all arms. This is usually done on the stacks of arms prior to manufacture. Particular attention shall be paid to defects commonly found in the ends, such as compression wood, red heart and other forms of decay, shakes, splits, through checks, scantiness, honeycomb, and low density, determined by rings per inch and percent of summerwood. All non-conforming arms shall be rejected. Whenever the number of nonconforming arms is found to exceed 0.5 percent of the lot or one arm, whichever is greater, the entire lot shall be rejected for excess number of defective ends. After the producer has removed or marked out the defective material, the arms may be resubmitted for inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Surface inspection of the lengthwise sides performed on a random representative sample. The sample size shall equal 20 percent of a lot size or 200 arms, whichever is smaller. The inspector shall examine side surfaces as they are slowly rotated. When necessary, the rotation may be stopped for closer inspection. All non-conforming arms shall be rejected. Whenever the number of nonconforming arms is found to exceed 2 percent of the sample size, the entire lot shall be rejected. After the producer has removed or marked out the defective material, the arms may be resubmitted for inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Check of moisture content of the random sample by a calibrated moisture meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Check of crossarm dimensions of the random sample measured after surfacing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inspection during manufacture shall consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Checking bolt and insulator pin holes for squareness and excessive splintering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Checking brands for completeness, location, and legibility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Checking arms for conformance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under the Independent Inspection Plan, there shall be a final inspection after treatment for preservative retention and penetration and for damage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Structural glued laminated timber shall be tested and inspected in accordance with AITC 200 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 1728.97).
