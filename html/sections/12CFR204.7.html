A supplemental reserve requirement may be imposed if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sole purpose of the requirement is to increase the amount of  reserves maintained to a level essential for the conduct of monetary  policy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement is not imposed for the purpose of reducing the  cost burdens resulting from the imposition of basic reserve  requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such requirement is not imposed for the purpose of increasing  the amount of balances needed for clearing purposes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On the date on which supplemental reserve requirements are  imposed, the total amount of basic reserve requirements is not less than  the amount of reserves that would be required on transaction accounts  and nonpersonal time deposits under the initial reserve ratios  established by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-221) in  effect on September 1, 1980.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Term. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a supplemental reserve requirement has been imposed  for a period of one year or more, the Board shall review and determine  the need for   continued maintenance of supplemental reserves and shall transmit annual  reports to the Congress regarding the need for continuing such  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any supplemental reserve requirement shall terminate at the  close of the first 90-day period after the requirement is imposed during  which the average amount of supplemental reserves required are less than  the amount of reserves which would be required if the ratios in effect  on September 1, 1980, were applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Earnings Participation Account. A depository institutions's  supplemental reserve requirement shall be maintained by the Federal  Reserve Banks in an Earnings Participation Account. Such balances shall  receive earnings to be paid by the Federal Reserve Banks during each  calendar quarter at a rate not to exceed the rate earned on the  securities portfolio of the Federal Reserve System during the previous  calendar quarter. Additional rules and regulations maybe prescribed by  the Board concerning the payment of earnings on Earnings Participation  Accounts by Federal Reserve Banks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Report to Congress. The Board shall transmit promptly to the  Congress a report stating the basis for exercising its authority to  require a supplemental reserve under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reserve requirements. At present, there are no supplemental  reserve requirements imposed under this section.  [45 FR 56018, Aug. 22, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 81537, Dec. 11, 1980.
