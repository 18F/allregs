                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State revenue matching. For each school year, the amount of State revenues appropriated or used specifically by the State for program purposes shall not be less than 30 percent of the funds received by such State under section 4 of the National School Lunch Act during the school year beginning July 1, 1980; provided that, the State revenues derived from the operation of such programs and State revenues expended for salaries and administrative expenses of such programs at the State level are not considered in this computation. However, if the per capita income of any State is less than the per capita income of the United States, the matching requirements so computed shall be decreased by the percentage by which the State per capita income is below the per capita income of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Private school exemption. No State in which the State agency is prohibited by law from disbursing State appropriated funds to nonpublic schools shall be required to match general cash assistance funds expended for meals served in such schools, or to disburse to such schools any of the State revenues required to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Furthermore, the requirements of this section do not apply to schools in which the Program is administered by a FNSRO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Territorial waiver. American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be exempted from the matching requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if their respective matching requirements are under $100,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicable revenues. The following State revenues, appropriated or used specifically for program purposes which are expended for any school year shall be eligible for meeting the applicable percentage of the matching requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section for that school year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State revenues disbursed by the State agency to school food authorities for program purposes, including revenue disbursed to nonprofit private schools where the State administers the program in such schools;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State revenues made available to school food authorities and transferred by the school food authorities to the nonprofit school food service accounts or otherwise expended by the school food authorities in connection with the nonprofit school food service program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State revenues used to finance the costs (other than State salaries or other State level administrative costs) of the nonprofit school food service program, i.e.:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Local program supervision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operating the program in participating schools; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The intrastate distribution of foods donated under part 250 of this chapter to schools participating in the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Distribution of matching revenues. All State revenues made available under paragraph (a) of this section are to be disbursed to school food authorities participating in the Program, except as provided for under paragraph (b) of this section. Distribution of matching revenues may be made with respect to a class of school food authorities as well as with respect to individual school food authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to match. If, in any school year, a State fails to meet the State revenue matching requirement, as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, the general cash assistance funds utilized by the State during that school year shall be subject to recall by and repayment to FNS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reports. Within 120 days after the end of each school year, each State agency shall submit an Annual Report of Revenues (FNS-13) to FNS. This report identifies the State revenues to be counted toward the State revenue matching requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accounting system. The State agency shall establish or cause to be established a system whereby all expended State revenues counted in meeting the matching requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section are properly documented and accounted for.</p>
