                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 102 of the Act requires that criteria for the issuance  of ocean disposal permits be promulgated after consideration of the  environmental effect of the proposed dumping operation, the need for  ocean dumping, alternatives to ocean dumping, and the effect of the  proposed action on esthetic, recreational and economic values and on  other uses of the ocean. These parts 227 and 228 of this subchapter H  together constitute the criteria established pursuant to section 102 of  the Act. The decision of the Administrator, Regional Administrator or  the District Engineer, as the case may be, to issue or deny a permit and  to impose specific conditions on any permit issued will be based on an  evaluation of the permit application pursuant to the criteria set forth  in this part 227 and upon the requirements for disposal site management  pursuant to the cri teria set forth in part 228 of this sub chapter H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to the criteria to be used in evaluating disposal  of dredged materials, this section and subparts C, D, E, and G apply in  their entirety. To determine whether the proposed dumping of dredged  material complies with subpart B, only Sec. Sec. 227.4, 227.5, 227.6,  227.9, 227.10 and 227.13 apply. An applicant for a permit to dump  dredged material must comply with all of subparts C, D, E, G and  applicable sections of B, to be deemed to have met the EPA criteria for  dredged material dumping promulgated pursuant to section 102(a) of the  Act. If, in any case, the Chief of Engineers finds that, in the  disposition of dredged material, there is no economically feasible  method or site available other than a dumping site, the utilization of  which would result in noncompliance with the criteria established  pursuant to subpart B relating to the effects of dumping or with the  restrictions established pursuant to section 102(c) of the Act relating  to critical areas, he shall so certify and request that the Secretary of  the Army seek a waiver from the Administrator pursuant to part 225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Criteria of this part 227 are established pursuant to  section 102 of   the Act and apply to the evaluation of proposed dumping of materials  under title I of the Act. The Criteria of this part 227 deal with the  evaluation of proposed dumping of materials on a case-by-case basis from  information supplied by the applicant or otherwise available to EPA or  the Corps of Engineers concerning the characteristics of the waste and  other considerations relating to the proposed dumping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After consideration of the provisions of Sec. Sec. 227.28 and  227.29, no permit will be issued when the dumping would result in a  violation of applicable water quality standards.</p>
