                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Status quo employees. Individuals who were Bureau employees on  October 31, 1979, with an appointment in either the competitive or  excepted service without time limitation, and who are serving in an  education position, shall be continued in their positions under the  terms and conditions of that appointment with no change in their status  or positions. Such employees are entitled to receive any changes in  compensation attached to the position. Although such employees occupy  ``education positions'' as defined in this part, the terms and  conditions of their appointment, status, and entitlements are determined  by competitive service regulations and procedures. Under applicable  procedures, these employees are eligible for consideration for movement  to other positions that are defined as ``contract education'' positions.  Such movement shall change the terms and conditions of their appointment  to the terms and conditions of employment established under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the tribe or school board waives the Indian preference law,  the employee loses the early-out retirement eligibility under Pub. L.  96-135, ``early-out for non-Indians,'' if they are entitled to the  early-out retirement. A memorandum for the record on BIA letterhead  shall be signed by the employee and placed on the permanent side of his/ her Official Personnel Folder, along with the tribal resolution, if the  tribe/school board has waived the Indian preference law to employ the  non-Indian.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conversion of status quo employees to contract positions. Status  quo employees may request in writing to the school supervisor, ASE or  AEPA, as applicable, that their position be converted to contract. The  appropriate school board will be consulted and a determination made by  such school board whether such individual should be converted to a  contract employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written determination by the school board should be received  within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days from receipt of  the request. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall  have the effect of disapproving the proposed conversion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With school board approval, an involuntary change in position  shall not affect the current status of status quo education employees.</p>
