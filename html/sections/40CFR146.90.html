                            <p class="depth0">The owner or operator of a Class VI well must prepare, maintain, and  comply with a testing and monitoring plan to verify that the geologic  sequestration project is operating as permitted and is not endangering  USDWs. The requirement to maintain and implement an approved plan is  directly enforceable regardless of whether the requirement is a  condition of the permit. The testing and monitoring plan must be  submitted with the permit application, for Director approval, and must  include a description of how the owner or operator will meet the  requirements of this section, including accessing sites for all  necessary monitoring and testing during the life of the project. Testing  and monitoring associated with geologic sequestration projects must, at  a minimum, include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Analysis of the carbon dioxide stream with sufficient frequency  to yield data representative of its chemical and physical  characteristics;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installation and use, except during well workovers as defined in  Sec.  146.88(d), of continuous recording devices to monitor injection  pressure, rate, and volume; the pressure on the annulus between the  tubing and the long string casing; and the annulus fluid volume added;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrosion monitoring of the well materials for loss of mass,  thickness, cracking, pitting, and other signs of corrosion, which must  be performed on a quarterly basis to ensure that the well components  meet the minimum standards for material strength and performance set  forth in Sec.  146.86(b), by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Analyzing coupons of the well construction materials placed in  contact with the carbon dioxide stream; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routing the carbon dioxide stream through a loop constructed  with the material used in the well and inspecting the materials in the  loop; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Using an alternative method approved by the Director;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality and geochemical  changes above the confining zone(s) that may be a result of carbon  dioxide movement through the confining zone(s) or additional identified  zones including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location and number of monitoring wells based on specific  information about the geologic sequestration project, including  injection rate and volume, geology, the presence of artificial  penetrations, and other factors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monitoring frequency and spatial distribution of monitoring  wells based on baseline geochemical data that has been collected under  Sec.  146.82(a)(6) and on any modeling results in the area of review  evaluation required by Sec.  146.84(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A demonstration of external mechanical integrity pursuant to  Sec.  146.89(c) at least once per year until the injection well is  plugged; and, if required by the Director, a casing inspection log  pursuant to requirements at Sec.  146.89(d) at a frequency established  in the testing and monitoring plan;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A pressure fall-off test at least once every five years unless  more frequent testing is required by the Director based on site-specific  information;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Testing and monitoring to track the extent of the carbon dioxide  plume and the presence or absence of elevated pressure (e.g., the  pressure front) by using:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct methods in the injection zone(s); and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indirect methods (e.g., seismic, electrical, gravity, or  electromagnetic surveys and/or down-hole carbon dioxide detection  tools), unless the Director determines, based on site-specific geology,  that such methods are not appropriate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Director may require surface air monitoring and/or soil gas  monitoring to detect movement of carbon dioxide that could endanger a  USDW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design of Class VI surface air and/or soil gas monitoring must  be based on potential risks to USDWs within the area of review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monitoring frequency and spatial distribution of surface air  monitoring and/or soil gas monitoring must be decided using baseline  data, and the monitoring plan must describe how the proposed monitoring  will yield useful information on the area of review delineation and/or  compliance with standards under Sec.  144.12 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an owner or operator demonstrates that monitoring employed  under Sec. Sec.  98.440 to 98.449 of this chapter (Clean Air Act, 42  U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) accomplishes the goals of paragraphs (h)(1) and (2)  of this section, and meets the requirements pursuant to Sec.   146.91(c)(5), a Director that requires surface air/soil gas monitoring  must approve the use of monitoring employed under Sec. Sec.  98.440 to  98.449 of this chapter. Compliance with Sec. Sec.  98.440 to 98.449 of  this chapter pursuant to this provision is considered a condition of the  Class VI permit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any additional monitoring, as required by the Director,  necessary to support, upgrade, and improve computational modeling of the  area of review evaluation required under Sec.  146.84(c) and to  determine compliance with standards under Sec.  144.12 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The owner or operator shall periodically review the testing and  monitoring plan to incorporate monitoring data collected under this  subpart, operational data collected under Sec.  146.88, and the most  recent area of review reevaluation performed under Sec.  146.84(e). In  no case shall the owner or operator review the testing and monitoring  plan less often than once every five years. Based on this review, the  owner or operator shall submit an amended testing and monitoring plan or  demonstrate to the Director that no amendment to the testing and  monitoring plan is needed. Any amendments to the testing and monitoring  plan must be approved by the Director, must be incorporated into the  permit, and are subject to the permit modification requirements at Sec.   144.39 or Sec.  144.41 of this chapter, as appropriate. Amended plans or  demonstrations shall be submitted to the Director as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within one year of an area of review reevaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following any significant changes to the facility, such as  addition of monitoring wells or newly permitted injection wells within  the area of review, on a schedule determined by the Director; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When required by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A quality assurance and surveillance plan for all testing and  monitoring requirements.</p>
