In requesting a salary offset, the creditor DOL agency must provide the paying DOL agency or other paying Federal agency with written certification stating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the debtor owes the creditor agency a debt (including the basis and amount of the debt);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date on which payment was due;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date on which the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the paying agency is another federal agency, that the creditor agency's regulations under 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management, and that the creditor agency has followed such regulations to the best of its information and belief.</p>
