                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval. MARAD may approve applications to enter into a MSP Operating Agreement and make MSP Payments with respect to vessels that are determined to be necessary to maintain a United States presence in international commercial shipping or those that are deemed, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to be militarily useful for meeting the sealift needs of the United States in national emergencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date--(1) General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the effective date of a MSP Operating Agreement is the date when executed by the Contractor and MARAD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the effective date of a MSP Operating Agreement is the date when executed by the Contractor and MARAD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. In the case of an Eligible Vessel to be included in a MSP Operating Agreement that is subject to an ODS contract under subtitle A, title VI, of the act or on charter to the U.S. Government, other than a charter under the provisions of an Emergency Preparedness Program Agreement provided by section 653 of the act, unless an earlier date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for a MSP Operating Agreement shall be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The expiration or termination date of the ODS contract or Government charter covering the vessel, respectively, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any earlier date on which the vessel is withdrawn from that contract or charter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Replacement Vessels. MARAD may approve the replacement of an Eligible Vessel in a MSP Operating Agreement provided the replacement vessel is eligible under Sec. 295.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to shipbuilders. The Contractor agrees that no later than 30 days after soliciting any offer or bid for the construction of any vessel in a foreign shipyard, and before entering into

any contract for construction of a vessel in a foreign shipyard, the Contractor shall provide notice of its intent to enter into such a contract (for vessels being considered for U.S.-flag registry) to MARAD. Within 10 business days after the receipt of such notification, MARAD shall issue a notice in the Federal Register of the Contractor's intent. The Contractor is prohibited from entering into any such contract until 10 business days after the date of publication of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Early termination. A MSP Operating Agreement shall terminate on a date specified by the Contractor if the Contractor notifies MARAD not later than 60 days before the effective date of the proposed termination, that the Contractor intends to terminate the Agreement. The Contractor shall be bound by the provisions relating to vessel documentation and national security commitments to the extent and for the period contained in section 652(m) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Non-renewal for lack of funds. If, by the first day of a fiscal year, insufficient funds have been appropriated under section 655 of the act for that fiscal year, MARAD shall notify the Congress that MSP Operating Agreements for which insufficient funds are available will be terminated on the 60th day of that fiscal year if sufficient funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available by that date. If only partial funding is appropriated by the 60th day of such fiscal year, then MSP Operating Agreements for which funds are not available shall be terminated using the pro rata distribution method used to award MSP Operating Agreements set forth in Sec. 295.12(d). With respect to each terminated agreement the Contractor shall be released from any further obligation under the agreement, and the Contractor may transfer and register the applicable vessel under a foreign registry deemed acceptable by MARAD. In the event that no funds are appropriated, then all MSP Operating Agreements shall be terminated and each Contractor shall be released from its obligations under the agreement. Final payments under the terminated agreements shall be made in accordance with Sec. 295.30. To the extent that funds are appropriated in a subsequent fiscal year, existing operating agreements may be renewed if mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Contractor and the MSP vessel remains eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Operation under a Continuing Resolution. In the event a Continuing Resolution (CR) is in place that does not provide sufficient appropriations to fully meet obligations under MSP Operating Agreements, a Contractor may request termination of the agreement in accordance with paragraph (f), herein, and Sec. 295.30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Requisition authority. To the extent section 902 of the act is applicable to any vessel transferred foreign under this section, the vessel shall remain available to be requisitioned by the Maritime Administration under that provision of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Transfer of Operating Agreements. A Contractor subject to an Agreement may transfer that Agreement (including all rights and obligations thereunder) to any person eligible to enter into an Agreement under the same priority established in section 652(i)(1)(A) of the act as the Contractor, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor gives notice of any such transfer to the Maritime Administrator by filing a completed application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transfer is not disapproved in writing by the Maritime Administrator within 90 days of the notification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> the vessel to be covered by the Agreement after transfer is the same vessel originally covered by the Agreement or is an eligible vessel under section 651(b) of the act and is the same type, and comparable to, the vessel originally covered by the Agreement.</p>
