                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Safety fuse shall only be used where sources of extraneous electricity make the use of electric blasting caps dangerous. The use of a fuse that has been hammered or injured in any way shall be forbidden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The hanging of a fuse on nails or other projections which will cause a sharp bend to be formed in the fuse is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before capping safety fuse, a short length shall be cut from the end of the supply reel so as to assure a fresh cut end in each blasting cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Only a cap crimper of approved design shall be used for attaching blasting caps to safety fuse. Crimpers shall be kept in good repair and accessible for use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No unused cap or short capped fuse shall be placed in any hole to be blasted; such unused detonators shall be removed from the working place and destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No fuse shall be capped, or primers made up, in any magazine or near any possible source of ignition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No one shall be permitted to carry detonators or primers of any kind on his person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The minimum length of safety fuse to be used in blasting shall be as required by State law, but shall not be less than 30 inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> At least two men shall be present when multiple cap and fuse blasting is done by hand lighting methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Not more than 12 fuses shall be lighted by each blaster when hand lighting devices are used. However, when two or more safety fuses in a group are lighted as one by means of igniter cord, or other similar fuse-lighting devices, they may be considered as one fuse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The so-called ``drop fuse'' method of dropping or pushing a primer or any explosive with a lighted fuse attached is forbidden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Cap and fuse shall not be used for firing mudcap charges unless charges are separated sufficiently to prevent one charge from dislodging other shots in the blast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> When blasting with safety fuses, consideration shall be given to the length and burning rate of the fuse. Sufficient time, with a margin of safety, shall always be provided for the blaster to reach a place of safety.</p>
