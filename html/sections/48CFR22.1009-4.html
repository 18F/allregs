The closing date for receipt of  offerors' requests for wage determinations for additional possible  places of performance should allow reasonable time for potential  offerors to review the solicitation and determine their interest in  competing. Generally, 10 to 15 days from the date of issuance of the  solicitation may be considered a reasonable period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The procedures in 14.304 shall apply to late receipt of  offerors' requests for wage determinations for additional places of  performance. However, late receipt of an offeror's request for a wage  determination for additional places of performance does not preclude the  offeror's competing for the proposed acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the contracting officer receives any timely requests for wage  determinations for additional places of performance the contracting  officer shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain wage determinations for the additional places of  performance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amend the solicitation to include all wage determinations and,  if necessary, extend the time for submission of final offers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the successful offeror did not make a timely request for a  wage determination and will perform in a place of performance for which  the contracting officer therefore did not request a wage determination,  the contracting officer shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Award the contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain a wage determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Incorporate the wage determination in the contract, retroactive  to the date of contract award and with no adjustment in contract price,  pursuant to the clause at 52.222-49, Service Contract Labor Standards- Place of Performance Unknown.
