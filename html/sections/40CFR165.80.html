You must comply with the regulations in this subpart if you are an owner or operator of one of the following businesses and if you also have a stationary pesticide container or a pesticide dispensing (including container refilling) area:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refilling establishments who repackage agricultural pesticides and whose principal business is retail sale (i.e., more than 50% of total annual revenue comes from retail operations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Custom blenders of agricultural pesticides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Businesses which apply an agricultural pesticide for compensation (other than trading of personal services between agricultural producers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When do I have to comply?
