Claims and defenses previously made but not reflected in the briefs will be deemed abandoned. The Commission may, in its discretion, limit the scope of any briefs to certain subjects or issues. A party shall attach to its brief copies of all documents, data compilations, tangible things, and affidavits upon which such party relies or intends to rely to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in its brief and such brief shall contain a full explanation of how each attachment is relevant to the issues and matters in dispute. All such attachments to a brief shall be documents, data compilations or tangible things, or affidavits made by persons, that were identified by any party in its information designations filed pursuant to Secs. 14.39(a)(10)(i), (a)(10)(ii), 14.27(f)(1), (f)(2), and 14.44(d)(1), (d)(2) of this subpart.

These briefs shall contain the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which the filing party is urging the Commission to adopt, with specific citation to the record, and supporting relevant authority and analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In cases in which discovery is not conducted, absent an order by the Commission that briefs be filed, parties may not submit briefs. If the Commission does authorize the filing of briefs in cases in which discovery is not conducted, briefs shall be filed concurrently by both the complainant and defendant at such time as designated by the Commission staff and in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases in which discovery is conducted, briefs shall be filed concurrently by both the complainant and defendant at such time designated by the Commission staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Briefs containing information which is claimed by an opposing or third party to be proprietary under Sec. 14.48 of this subpart shall be submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 0.459 of this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public Inspection.''

Reply briefs shall be no longer than ten pages. Either on its own motion or upon proper motion by a party, the Commission

staff may establish other page limits for briefs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commission may require the parties to submit any additional information it deems appropriate for a full, fair, and expeditious resolution of the proceeding, including affidavits and exhibits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The parties shall submit a joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts, and key legal issues no later than two business days prior to the initial status conference, scheduled in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 14.50(a) of this subpart.</p>
