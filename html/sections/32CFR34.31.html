                            <p class="depth0">The following requirements pertain to recipients' procurements funded in whole or in part with Federal funds or with recipients' cost-share or match:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reasonable cost. Recipients procurement procedures shall make maximum practicable use of competition, or shall use other means that ensure reasonable cost for procured goods and services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pre-award review of certain procurements.

proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) related to the procurement. Recipients will only be required to provide such documents for the grants officer's pre-award review in exceptional cases where the grants officer judges that there is a compelling need to do so. In such cases, the grants officer must include a provision in the award that states the requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract provisions. (1) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination for default by the recipient or for termination due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All negotiated contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall include a provision permitting access of the Department of Defense, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific program, for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcriptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All contracts, including those for amounts less than the simplified acquisition threshold, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Reports and Records</p>
