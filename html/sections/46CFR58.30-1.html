                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains requirements for fluid power transmission  and control systems and appurtenances. Except as otherwise provided for  in this section, these requirements are applicable to the following  fluid power and control systems:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Steering apparatus, main and auxiliary, including bow thruster  systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cargo hatch operating systems unless fitted with an alternate  mechanical means of operation and approved by the Commandant as  hydraulically or pneumatically fail-safe. A system is considered to be  fail-safe if a component failure will result in a slow and controlled  release of the loading so as not to endanger personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Watertight door operating system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Automatic propulsion boiler system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Starting systems for internal combustion engines used for main  propulsion, main or auxiliary power, as the prime mover for any required  emergency apparatus, or as the source of propulsion power in ship  maneuvering thruster systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Centralized control system of main propulsion and auxiliary  machinery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lifeboat handling equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Controllable pitch propeller system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Installations used to remotely control components of piping  systems listed in Sec. 56.01-10(c)(1) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> All systems containing a pneumatic or hydropneumatic  accumulator. In the case of hydropneumatic accumulators where it can be  shown to the satisfaction of the Commandant that due to friction losses,  constriction, or other design features, the hazard of explosive rupture  does not exist downstream of a certain point in the hydraulic system,  the requirements of this subpart will   apply only to the accumulator and the system upstream of this point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Materials and/or personnel handling equipment systems, i.e.  cranes, hydraulic elevators, etc., not approved by the Commandant as  fail-safe as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Any fluid power or control system installed in the cargo area  of pump rooms on a tank vessel, or in spaces in which cargo is handled  on a liquefied flammable gas carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> All pneumatic power and control systems having a maximum  allowable working pressure in excess of 150 pounds per square inch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Any other hydraulic or pneumatic system on board that, in the  judgment of the Commandant, constitutes a hazard to the seaworthiness of  the ship or the safety of personnel either in normal operation or in  case of failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other fluid power and control systems do not have to comply with  the detailed requirements of this subpart but must meet the requirements  of Sec. 58.30-50.
