                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The test probe for thoracic impacts, except for attachments, shall be of rigid metallic construction and concentric about its longitudinal axis. Any attachments to the impactor such as suspension hardware, and impact vanes, must meet the requirements of Sec. 572.144(c)(7) of this part. The impactor shall have a mass of 1.70 0.02 kg (3.75 0.05 lb) and a minimum mass moment of inertia 164 kg-cm\2\ (0.145 lb-in-sec\2\) in yaw and pitch about the CG of the probe. One-third (\1/3\) of the weight of suspension cables and any attachments to the impact probe must be included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis of the probe, has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 50.8 0.25 mm (2.00 0.01 inch) diameter face with an edge radius of 7.6/12.7 mm (0.3/0.5 in). The impactor shall have a 53.3 mm (2.1 in) dia. cylindrical surface extending for a minimum of 25.4 mm (1.0 in) to the rear from the impact face. The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency not less than 1000 Hz limited to the direction of the longitudinal axis of the impactor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Head accelerometers shall have the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive mass locations specified in drawing SA 572-S4 and be mounted in the head as shown in drawing 210-0000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The neck force-moment transducer shall have the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive axis locations specified in drawing SA 572-S19 and be mounted at the upper neck transducer location as shown in

Triaxial accelerometers may be mounted as optional instrumentation at T1, and T12, and in uniaxial configuration on the sternum at the midpoint level of ribs No. 1 and No. 3 and on the spine coinciding with the midpoint level of No. 3 rib, as shown in drawing 210-0000. If used, the accelerometers must conform to SA-572-S4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The chest deflection potentiometer shall have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA-572-S50 and be mounted in the torso assembly as shown drawing 210-0000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The lumbar spine force/moment transducer may be mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 210-0000 as optional instrumentation in place of part No. 210-4150.
