Nor is  the deduction subject to percentage limitations such as are applicable  to the charitable deduction under the income tax.

See Sec. Sec. 20.2055-4 and 20.2055-5 for rules relating to the  disallowance of deductions to trusts and organizations which engage in  certain prohibited transactions or whose governing instruments do not  contain certain specified requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Powers of appointment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A deduction is  allowable under section 2055(b) for the value of property passing to or  for the use of a transferee described in paragraph (a) of this section  by the exercise, failure to exercise, release or lapse of a power of  appointment by reason of which the property is includible in the  decedent's gross estate under section 2041.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. See also section 6503(e) for  suspension of the period of limitations for assessment or collection of  any deficiency attributable to the allowance of the deduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of evidence.

If the instrument is of record the copy should  be certified, and if not of record, the copy should be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written statement by the executor containing a declaration  that it is made under penalties of perjury and stating whether any  action has been instituted to construe or to contest the decedent's will  or any provision thereof affecting the charitable deduction claimed and  whether, according to his   information and belief, any such action is designed or contemplated.  The executor shall also submit such other documents or evidence as may  be requested by the district director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cross references. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> See section 2055(f) for certain cross  references relating to section 2055.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For treatment of bequests accepted by the Secretary of State or  the Secretary of Commerce, for the purpose of organizing and holding an  international conference to negotiate a Patent Corporation Treaty, as  bequests to or for the use of the United States, see section 3 of Joint  Resolution of December 24, 1969 (Pub.
