                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The initial determination is whether to make a record available  in response to a FOIA request. A full release may be made by an official  knowledgeable of the record, with authority to determine that no harm  would come from release. Adverse determinations (refer to Sec. 300.3(b))  must be made by the designated Initial Denial Authority (IDA) except for  determinations made regarding the requester category and requests for  fee waivers or expedited processing. By this regulation, the Director,  DLA, delegates to Heads of DLA Components (see Sec. 300.3(h)) the  designation of IDA. The designation of IDA may be further delegated by  the Heads of DLA Components to their Deputies. The IDA shall review all  recommendations for withholding information and whether the criteria for  withholding under one or more FOIA exemptions are met. DLA has IDAs  throughout the agency; and each IDA will make the determination for  records within their area of functional responsibility. If a request  involves records from more than one functional area, consultation will  be done with all responsible IDAs but will be signed by the IDA assigned  the primary responsibility for processing the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FOIA requires that any reasonably segregable portion of a  record must be released after appropriate application of the Act's nine  exemptions. Segregation is not reasonable when it would produce an  essentially meaningless set of words and phrases, or even sentences  which taken separately or together have minimal or no information  content.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If information is withheld in whole or part, DLA will provide in  a response letter the exemption under which the withholding is made, a  description of the type of information redacted, the name and title or  position of the IDA and the administrative appeal rights. When  information is withheld in full, DLA will provide an estimate of the  volume withheld. This estimate should be in number of pages or in some  other reasonable form of estimation. When information is withheld in  part, DLA will show the redacted amount of information and the exemption  under which the redaction is made on the released portion of the record,  unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the  exemption under which the redaction is made.</p>
