                            <p class="depth0">Notification and Initial and Final Communications Outage Reports  shall be submitted by a person authorized by the communications provider  to submit such reports to the Commission. The person submitting the  Final report to the Commission shall also be authorized by the provider  to legally bind the provider to the truth, completeness, and accuracy of  the information contained in the report. Each Final report shall be  attested by the person submitting the report that he/she has read the  report prior to submitting it and on oath deposes and states that the  information contained therein is true, correct, and accurate to the best  of his/her knowledge and belief and that the communications provider on  oath deposes and states that this information is true, complete, and  accurate. The Notification shall provide: The name of the reporting  entity; the date and time of onset of the outage; a brief description of  the problem; service effects; the geographic area affected by the  outage; and a contact name and contact telephone number by which the  Commission's technical staff may contact the reporting entity. The  Initial and Final Reports shall contain the information required in this  part 4. The Initial report shall contain all pertinent information then  available on the outage and shall be submitted in good faith. The Final  report shall contain all pertinent information on the outage, including  any information that was not contained in, or that has changed from that  provided in, the Initial report. The Notification and the Initial and  Final Communications Outage Reports are to be submitted electronically  to the Commission. ``Submitted electronically'' refers to submission of  the information using Commission-approved Web-based outage report  templates. If there are technical impediments to using the Web-based  system during the Notification stage, then a written Notification to the  Commission by e-mail, FAX, or courier may be used; such Notification  shall contain the information required. All hand-delivered Notifications  and Initial and Final Communications Outage Reports, shall be addressed  to the Federal Communications Commission, The Office of Secretary,  Attention: Chief, Public Safety & Homeland Security Bureau. Electronic  filing shall be effectuated in accordance with procedures that are  specified by the Commission by public notice. Notifications and initial  reports may be withdrawn under legitimate circumstances, e.g., when the  filing was made under the mistaken assumption that an outage was  required to be reported.
