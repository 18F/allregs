OSM will  publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interim Federal enforcement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If OSM determines under  paragraph (a) that direct Federal enforcement is necessary, Sec. Sec.  817.41(j), 817.121(c)(2), and 817.121(c)(4) of this chapter will apply  to each underground mining operation subject to that determination that  is conducted in a State with an approved State regulatory program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> exists, the authorized  representative must issue a notice of violation or cessation order, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph (b) will remain effective in a State with an  approved State regulatory program until the State adopts, and OSM  approves, under part 732 of this chapter, provisions consistent with  Sec. Sec. 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) of this chapter. After these  provisions are approved, this paragraph will remain effective only for  violations of Sec. Sec. 817.41(j) and 817.121(c)(2) that are not  regulated by the State regulatory authority.  [60 FR 16750, Mar. 31, 1995]</p>
