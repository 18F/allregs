                                Sec. 25.2511-3  Transfers by nonresidents not citizens.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Sections 2501 and 2511 contain rules relating to the taxation of transfers of property by gift by a donor who is a nonresident not a citizen of the United States. (See paragraph (b) of Sec. 25.2501-1 for the definition of the term ``resident'' for purposes of the gift tax.) As combined these rules are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gift tax applies only to the transfer of real property and tangible personal property situated in the United States at the time of the transfer if either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The gift was made on or after January 1, 1967, by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who was not an expatriate to whom section 2501(a)(2) was inapplicable on the date of the gift by reason of section 2501(a)(3) and paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 25.2501-1, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gift was made before January 1, 1967, by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who was not engaged in business in the United States during the calendar year in which the gift was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The gift tax applies to the transfer of all property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) situated in the United States at the time of the transfer if either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The gift was made on or after January 1, 1967, by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who was an expatriate to whom section 2501(a)(2) was inapplicable on the date of the gift by reason of section 2501(a)(3) and paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 25.2501-1, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The gift was made before January 1, 1967, by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States who was engaged in business in the United States during the calendar year in which the gift was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Situs of property. For purposes of applying the gift tax to the transfer of property owned and held by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States at the time of the transfer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Real property and tangible personal property. Real property and tangible personal property constitute property within the United States only if they are physically situated therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intangible personal property. Except as provided otherwise in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, intangible personal property constitutes property within the United States if it consists of a property right issued by or enforceable against a resident of the United States or a domestic corporation (public or private), irrespective of where the written evidence of the property is physically located at the time of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Shares of stock. Irrespective of where the stock certificates are physically located at the time of the transfer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shares of stock issued by a domestic corporation constitute property within the United States, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shares of stock issued by a corporation which is not a domestic corporation constitute property situated outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Debt obligations. (i) In the case of gifts made on or after January 1, 1967, a debt obligation, including a bank deposit, the primary obligor of which is a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instumentality of any such government constitutes property situated within the United States. This subdivision applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a debt obligation of a domestic corporation, whether or not any interest on the obligation would be treated under section 862(a)(1) as income from sources without the United States by reason of section 861(a)(1)(B) (relating to interest received from a domestic corporation less than 20 percent of whose gross income for a 3-year period was derived from sources within the United States) and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an amount described in section 861(c) (relating to certain bank deposits, withdrawable accounts, and amounts held by an insurance company under an agreement to pay interest), whether or not any interest thereon would be treated under section 862(a)(1) as income from sources without the United States by reason of section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest on amounts described in section 861(c) which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States) and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a deposit with a domestic corporation or domestic partnership, whether or not the deposit is with a foreign branch thereof engaged in the commercial banking business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Irrespective of where the written evidence of the debt obligation is physically located at the time of the transfer.

For purposes of this subdivision, a debt obligation on which there are two or more primary obligors shall be apportioned among such obligors, taking into account to the extent appropriate under all the facts and circumstances any choate or inchoate rights of contribution existing among such obligors with respect to the indebtedness. The term ``agency or instrumentality'', as used in this subdivision, does not include a possession of the United States or an agency or instrumentality of a possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of gifts made on or after January 1, 1967, a debt obligation, including a bank deposit, not deemed under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to be situated within the United States, constitutes property situated outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of gifts made before January 1, 1967, a debt obligation the written evidence of which is treated as being the property itself constitutes property situated within the United States if the written evidence of the obligation is physically located in the United States at the time of the transfer, irrespective of who is the primary obligor on the debt. If the written evidence of the obligation is physically located outside the United States, the debt obligation constitutes property situated outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Currency is not a debt obligation for purposes of this subparagraph.
