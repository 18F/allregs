Paragraphs and (2) of this section explain the symbols used in lines 1 and 2, in order, under the tank segregation column of Table 151.05.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Segregation of cargo from surrounding waters (Line 1 of Table 151.05).
i = Skin of vessel (single skin) only required. Cargo tank wall can be vessel's hull.ii = Double skin required. Cargo tank wall cannot be vessel's hull.NA = Nonapplicable for this case.

i = Single bulkhead only required. Tank wall can be sole separating medium.ii = Double bulkhead, required. Cofferdam, empty tank, pumproom, tank with Grade E Liquid (if compatible with cargo) is satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a cofferdam is required for segregation purposes and a secondary barrier is required for low temperature protection by Sec.  151.15-3(d)(4), the void space between the primary and secondary barriers shall not be acceptable in lieu of the required cofferdam.
