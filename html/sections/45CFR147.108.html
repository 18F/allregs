                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No preexisting condition exclusions--(1) In general. A group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion (as defined in Sec. 144.103).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion (as defined in Sec. 144.103).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples (for additional examples illustrating the definition of a preexisting condition exclusion, see Sec. 146.111(a)(1)(ii)):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides benefits solely through an insurance policy offered by Issuer P. At the expiration of the policy, the plan switches coverage to a policy offered by Issuer N. N's policy excludes benefits for oral surgery required as a result of a traumatic injury if the injury occurred before the effective date of coverage under the policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the exclusion of benefits for oral surgery required as a result of a traumatic injury if the injury

occurred before the effective date of coverage is a preexisting condition exclusion because it operates to exclude benefits for a condition based on the fact that the condition was present before the effective date of coverage under the policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual C applies for individual health 2insurance coverage with Issuer M. M denies C's application for coverage because a pre-enrollment physical revealed that C has type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, M's denial of C's application for coverage is a preexisting condition exclusion because a denial of an application for coverage based on the fact that a condition was present before the date of denial is an exclusion of benefits based on a preexisting condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability--(1) General applicability date. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the rules of this section apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014; in the case of individual health insurance coverage, for policy years beginning, or applications denied, on or after January 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General applicability date. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the rules of this section apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014; in the case of individual health insurance coverage, for policy years beginning, or applications denied, on or after January 1, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early applicability date for children. The rules of this section apply with respect to enrollees, including applicants for enrollment, who are under 19 years of age for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010; in the case of individual health insurance coverage, for policy years beginning, or applications denied, on or after September 23, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicability to grandfathered health plans. See Sec. 147.140 of this part for determining the application of this section to grandfathered health plans (providing that a grandfathered health plan that is a group health plan or group health insurance coverage must comply with the prohibition against preexisting condition exclusions; however, a grandfathered health plan that is individual health insurance coverage is not required to comply with PHS Act section 2704).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual F commences employment and enrolls F and F's 16-year-old child in the group health plan maintained by F's employer, with a first day of coverage of October 15, 2010. F's child had a significant break in coverage because of a lapse of more than 63 days without creditable coverage immediately prior to enrolling in the plan. F's child was treated for asthma within the six-month period prior to the enrollment date and the plan imposes a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion for coverage of asthma. The next plan year begins on January 1, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the plan year beginning January 1, 2011, is the first plan year of the group health plan beginning on or after September 23, 2010. Thus, beginning on January 1, 2011, because the child is under 19 years of age, the plan cannot impose a preexisting condition exclusion with respect to the child's asthma regardless of the fact that the preexisting condition exclusion was imposed by the plan before the applicability date of this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual G applies for a policy of family coverage in the individual market for G, G's spouse, and G's 13-year-old child. The issuer denies the application for coverage on March 1, 2011 because G's 13-year-old child has autism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the issuer's denial of G's application for a policy of family coverage in the individual market is a preexisting condition exclusion because the denial was based on the child's autism, which was present before the date of denial of coverage. Because the child is under 19 years of age and the March 1, 2011, denial of coverage is after the applicability date of this section, the issuer is prohibited from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion with respect to G's 13-year-old child.
