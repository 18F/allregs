Support means any action, including financing, transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person facilitates an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other activities unrelated to exports.

BIS may inform U.S. persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve the types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the U.S. person from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the term U.S. person includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign branches; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any person in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> License review standards. Applications to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities would make a material contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear explosive devices, chemical or biological weapons, or of missiles.
