                            <p class="depth0">If it is an expenditure-based award, a TIA must require the  recipient to obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if there is  to be a change in   plans that may result in a need for additional Federal funding (this is  unnecessary for a fixed-support TIA because the recipient is responsible  for additional costs of achieving the outcomes). Other than that, the  program official's substantial involvement in the project should ensure  that the Government has advance notice of changes in plans.</p>
