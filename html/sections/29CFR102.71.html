Any party may obtain a review of such action by filing a request therefor with the Board in Washington, DC, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. A request for review from an action of a regional director pursuant to this subsection may be granted only upon one or more of the following grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a substantial question of law or policy is raised because of (i) the absence of, or (ii) a departure from, officially reported Board precedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are compelling reasons for reconsideration of an important Board rule or policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The request for review is accompanied by documentary evidence previously submitted to the regional director raising serious doubts as to the regional director's factual findings, thus indicating that there are factual issues which can best be resolved upon the basis of a record developed at a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The regional director's action is, on its face, arbitrary or capricious.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The petition raises issues which can best be resolved upon the basis of a record developed at a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the regional director dismisses a petition or directs that the proceeding on the petition be held in abeyance, and such action is taken because of the pendency of concurrent unresolved charges of unfair labor practices, and the regional director, upon request, has so notified the parties in writing, any party may obtain a review of the regional director's action by filing a request therefor with the Board in Washington, DC, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. A review of an action of a regional director pursuant to this subsection may be granted only upon one or more of the following grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a substantial question of law or policy is raised because of (i) the absence of, or (ii) a departure from, officially reported Board precedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are compelling reasons for reconsideration of an important Board rule or policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The regional director's action is, on its face, arbitrary or capricious.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A request for review must be filed with the Board in Washington, DC, and a copy filed with the regional director and copies served on all the other parties within 14 days of service of the notice of dismissal or notification that the petition is to be held in abeyance. The request shall be submitted in eight

copies and shall contain a complete statement setting forth facts and reasons upon which the request is based. The request shall be printed or otherwise legibly duplicated. Extra copies of electronically-filed papers need not be filed. Requests for an extension of time within which to file the request for review shall be filed with the Board in Washington, DC, and a certificate of service shall accompany the requests.
