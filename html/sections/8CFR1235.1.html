                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Application to lawfully enter the United States shall  be made in person to an immigration officer at a U.S. port-of-entry when  the port is open for inspection, or as otherwise designated in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. citizens. A person claiming U.S. citizenship must establish  that fact to the examining officer's satisfaction and must present a  U.S. passport if such passport is required under the provisions of 22  CFR part 53. If such applicant for admission fails to satisfy the  examining immigration officer that he or she is a U.S. citizen, he or  she shall thereafter be inspected as an alien.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alien members of United States Armed Forces and members of a  force of a NATO country. Any alien member of the United States Armed  Forces who is in the uniform of, or bears documents identifying him or  her as a member of, such Armed Forces, and who is coming to or departing  from the United States under official orders or permit of such Armed  Forces is not subject to the removal provisions of the Act. A member of  the force of a NATO country signatory to Article III of the Status of  Forces Agreement seeking to enter the United States under official  orders is exempt from the control provision of the Act. Any alien who is  a member of either of the foregoing classes may, upon request, be  inspected and his or her entry as an alien may be recorded. If the alien  does not appear to the examining immigration officer to be clearly and  beyond a doubt entitled to enter the United States under the provisions  of the Act, the alien shall be so informed and his or her entry shall  not be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alien applicants for admission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each alien seeking admission  at a United States port-of-entry shall present whatever documents are  required and shall establish to the satisfaction of the immigration  officer that he or she is not subject to removal under the immigration  laws, Executive Orders, or Presidential Proclamations and is entitled  under all of the applicable provisions of the immigration laws and this  chapter to enter the United States. A person claiming to have been  lawfully admitted for permanent residence must establish that fact to  the satisfaction of the inspecting immigration officer and must present  proper documents in accordance with Sec. 211.1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted  or paroled or an alien who seeks entry at other than an open, designated  port-of-entry, except as otherwise permitted in this section, is subject  to the provisions of section 212(a) of the Act and to removal under  section 235(b) or 240 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An alien who is brought to the United States, whether or not to  a designated port-of-entry and regardless of the means of  transportation, after having been interdicted in international or United  States waters, is considered an applicant for admission and shall be  examined under section 235(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An alien stowaway is not an applicant for admission and may not  be admitted to the United States. A stowaway shall be removed from the  United States under section 235(a)(2) of the Act. The provisions of  section 240 of   the Act are not applicable to stowaways, nor is the stowaway entitled to  further hearing or review of the removal, except that an alien stowaway  who indicates an intention to apply for asylum, or expresses a fear of  persecution, a fear of torture, or a fear of return to the country of  proposed removal shall be referred to an asylum officer for a  determination of credible fear of persecution or torture in accordance  with section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 1208.30 of this chapter.  An alien stowaway who is determined to have a credible fear of  persecution or torture shall have his or her asylum application  adjudicated in accordance with Sec. 1208.2(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents of the United States,  and other aliens, entering the United States along the northern border,  other than at a Port-of-Entry. A citizen or lawful permanent resident of  the United States, a Canadian national or landed immigrant of Canada  having a common nationality with nationals of Canada, or a landed  immigrant of Canada who is a national of a country listed in Sec.  217.2(a), may, if in possession of a valid, unexpired, Canadian Border  Boat Landing Permit (Form I-68) or evidence of enrollment in any other  Service Alternaitve Inspections program (e.g., the Immigration and  Naturalization Service Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS) or  the Port Passenger Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS)), enter the  United States by means of a pleasure craft along the northern border of  the United States from time-to-time without further inspection. No  persons other than those described in this paragraph may participate in  this program. Landed immigrants of Canada who do not share a common  nationality with nationals of Canada, but who are nationals of a  designated country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of this chapter (Visa Waiver  Pilot Program) must be in possession of a valid, unexpired passport  issued by his or her country of nationality, and an unexpired multiple  entry Form I-94 or I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure  Form, and a valid unexpired United States visa (if the alien is not in  possession of a valid unexpired Form I-94W). When an entry to the United  States is made by a person who is a Canadian citizen or a landed  immigrant of Canada, entry may be made under this program only for a  purpose as described in section 101(a)(15)(B)(ii) of the Act. Persons  seeking to enter the United States for any other purpose must do so at a  staffed Port-of-Entry. Persons aboard a vessel which has crossed the  international boundary between the United States and Canada and who do  not intend to land in the United States, other than at a staffed Port- of-Entry, are not required to be in possession of Form I-68 or evidence  of enrollment in an Alternative Inspections program merely because they  have crossed the international boundary. However, the Service retains  the right to conduct inspections or examinations of all persons applying  for admission or readmission to or seeking transit through the United  States in accordance with the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application. An eligible applicant may apply for a Canadian  Border Boat Landing Permit by completing the Form I-68 in triplicate.  Application forms will be made readily available through the Internet,  from a Service office, or by mail. A family may apply on a single  application. For the purposes of this paragraph, a family is defined as  a husband, wife, unmarried children under the age of 21, and the parents  of either husband or wife, who reside at the same address. In order for  the I-68 application to be considered complete, it must be accompanied  by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each person included on the application, evidence of  citizenship, and, if not a citizen of the Untied States or Canada,  evidence of legal permanent resident status in either the United States  or Canada. Evidence of residency must be submitted by all applicants. It  is not required that all persons on the application be of the same  nationality; however, they must all be individually eligible to  participate in this program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If multiple members of a family, as defined in paragraph (e)(1)  of this section, are included on a single application, evidence of the  familial relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A fee as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 8 CFR chapter I.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of any previously approved Form I-68.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A landed immigrant of Canada who does not have a common  nationality with nationals of Canada, but who is a national of a  designated country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of 8 CFR chapter I (Visa  Waiver Pilot Program) must also present his or her passport, a valid  unexpired multiple entry Form I-94 or I-94W and valid, unexpired  nonimmigrant visa if he or she is not in possession of a valid,  unexpired multiple entry Form I-94W. Such a landed immigrant of Canada  may apply for admission simultaneously with the I-68 application and  thereby obtain a Form I-94 or I-94W.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submission of Form I-68. Except as indicated in this paragraph,  Form I-68 shall be properly completed and submitted in person, along  with the documentary evidence and the required fee as specified in Sec.  103.7(b)(1) of 8 CFR chapter I, to a United States immigration officer  at a Canadian border Port-of-Entry located within the district having  jurisdiction over the applicant's residence or intended place of  landing. Persons previously granted Form I-68 approval may apply by mail  to the issuing Service office for renewal if a copy of the previous Form  I-68 is included in the application. At the discretion of the district  director concerned, any applicant for renewal of Form I-68 may be  required to appear for an interview in person if the applicant does not  appear to be clearly eligible for renewal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Act all applicable  grounds of inadmissibility, the I-68 application may be approved for  such non-citizens. If the Form I-68 application is denied, the applicant  shall be given written notice of and the reasons for the denial by  letter from the district director. There is no appeal from the denial of  the Form I-68 application, but the denial is without prejudice to a  subsequent application for this program or any other Service benefit,  except that the applicant may not submit a subsequent Form I-68  application for 90 days after the date of the last denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Validity. Form I-68 shall be valid for 1 year from the date of  issuance, or until revoked or violated by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conditions for participation in the I-68 program. Upon being  inspected and positively identified by an immigration officer and found  admissible and eligible for participation in the I-68 program, a  participant must agree to abide by the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Form I-68 may be used only when entering the United States by  means of a vessel exclusively used for pleasure, including chartered  vessels when such vessel has been chartered by an approved Form I-68  holder. When used by a person who is a not a citizen or a lawful  permanent resident of the United States, admission shall be for a period  not to exceed 72 hours to visit within 25 miles of the shore line along  the northern border of the United States, including the shore line of  Lake Michigan and Puget Sound.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Participants must be in possession of any authorization  documents issued for participation in this program or another Service  Alternative Inspections program (INSPASS or PORTPASS). Participants over  the age of 15 years and who are not in possession of an INSPASS or  PORTPASS enrollment card must also be in possession of a photographic  identification document issued by a governmental agency. Participants  who are landed immigrants of Canada and do not have a common nationality  with nationals of Canada, but who are nationals of a designated country  listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of 8 CFR chapter I must also be in possession  of proper documentation as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Participants may not import merchandise or transport  controlled or restricted items while entering the United States under  this program. The entry of any merchandise or goods must be in  accordance with the laws and regulations of all Federal Inspection  Services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Participants must agree to random checks or inspections that  may be conducted by the Service, at any time   and at any location, to ensure compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Participants must abide by all Federal, state, and local laws  regarding the importation of alcohol or agricultural products or the  importation or possession of controlled substances as defined in section  101 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Participants acknowledge that all devices, decals, cards, or  other Federal Government supplied identification or technology used to  identify or inspect persons or vessels seeking entry via this program  remain the property of the United States Government at all times, and  must be surrendered upon request by a Border Patrol Agent or any other  officer of a Federal Inspection Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The captain, charterer, master, or owner (if aboard) of each  vessel bringing persons into the United States is responsible for  determining that all persons aboard the vessel are in possession of a  valid, unexpired Form I-68 or other evidence of participation in a  Service Alternative Inspections program (INSPASS or PORTPASS) prior to  entry into the territorial waters of the United States. If any person on  board is not in possession of such evidence, the captain, charterer,  master, or owner must transport such person to a staffed United States  Port-of-Entry for an in-person immigration inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Revocation. The district director, the chief patrol agent, or  their designated representatives may revoke the designation of any  participant who violates any condition of this program, as contained in  paragraph (e)(5) of this section, or who has violated any immigration  law or regulation, or a law or regulation of the United States Customs  Service or other Federal Inspection Service, has abandoned his or her  residence in the United States or Canada, is inadmissible to the United  States, or who is otherwise determined by an immigration officer to be  ineligible for continued participation in this program. Such persons may  be subject to other applicable sanctions, such as criminal and/or  administrative prosecution or deportation, as well as possible seizure  of goods and/or vessels. If permission to participate is revoked, a  written request to the district director for restoration of permission  to participate may be made. The district director will notify the person  of his or her decision and the reasons therefore in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compliance checking. Participation in this program does not  relieve the holder from responsibility to comply with all other aspects  of United States Immigration, Customs, or other Federal inspection  service laws or regulations. To prevent abuse, the United States  Immigration and Naturalization Service retains the right to conduct  inspections or examinations of all persons applying for admission or  readmission to or seeking transit through the United States in  accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Form I-94, Arrival Departure Record. (1) Unless otherwise  exempted, each arriving nonimmigrant who is admitted to the United  States shall be issued, upon payment of a fee prescribed in Sec.  103.7(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this chapter for land border admissions, a Form I-94 as  evidence of the terms of admission. A Form I-94 issued at a land border  port-of-entry shall be considered issued for multiple entries unless  specifically annotated for a limited number of entries. A Form I-94  issued at other than a land border port-of-entry, unless issued for  multiple entries, must be surrendered upon departure from the United  States in accordance with the instructions on the form. Form I-94 is not  required by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any nonimmigrant alien described in Sec. 1212.1(a) of this  chapter and 22 CFR 41.33 who is admitted as a visitor for business or  pleasure or admitted to proceed in direct transit through the United  States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any nonimmigrant alien residing in the British Virgin Islands  who was admitted only to the U.S. Virgin Islands as a visitor for  business or pleasure under Sec. 212.1(b) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, any  Mexican national who is exempt from a visa and passport pursuant to  Sec. 1212.1(c)(1) of this chapter, or who is in possession of a  passport and valid visa who is admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor for a  period not to exceed 72 hours to visit within 25 miles of the border;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Bearers of Mexican diplomatic or official passports described  in Sec. 1212.1(c) of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any Mexican national who is exempt from a visa and passport  pursuant to Sec. 1212.1(c)(1) of this chapter, or is in possession of a  passport and valid visa who is admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor at the  Mexican border POEs in the State of Arizona at Sasabe, Nogales,  Mariposa, Naco, or Douglas for a period not to exceed 72 hours to visit  within the State of Arizona and within 75 miles of the border.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paroled aliens.
