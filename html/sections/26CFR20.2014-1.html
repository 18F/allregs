                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) A credit is allowed under section 2014 against  the Federal estate tax for any estate, inheritance, legacy, or  succession taxes actually paid to any foreign country (hereinafter  referred to as ``foreign death taxes''). The credit is allowed only for  foreign death taxes paid (i) with respect to property situated within  the country to which the tax is paid, (ii) with respect to property  included in the decedent's gross estate, and (iii) with respect to the  decedent's estate. The credit is allowable to the estate of a decedent  who was a citizen of the United States at the time of his death. The  credit is also allowable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,  to the estate of a decedent who was a resident but not a citizen of the  United States at the time of his death. The credit is not allowable to  the estate of a decedent who was neither a citizen nor a resident of the  United States at the time of his death. See paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of Sec.  20.0-1 for the meaning of the term ``resident'' as applied to a  decedent. The credit is allowable not only for death taxes paid to  foreign countries which are states in the international sense, but also  for death taxes paid to possessions or political subdivisions of foreign  states. With respect to the estate of a decedent dying after September  2, 1958, the term ``foreign country'', as used in this section and  Sec. Sec. 20.2014-2 to 20.2014-6, includes a possession of the United  States. See Sec. Sec. 20.2011-1 and 20.2011-2 for the allowance of a  credit for death taxes paid to a possession of the United States in the  case of a decedent dying before September 3, 1958. No credit is  allowable for interest or penalties paid in connection with foreign  death taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the credit for foreign death taxes under section  2014, similar credits are allowed under death tax conventions with  certain foreign   countries. If credits against the Federal estate tax are allowable under  section 2014, or under section 2014 and one or more death tax  conventions, for death taxes paid to more than one country, the credits  are combined and the aggregate amount is credited against the Federal  estate tax, subject to the limitation provided for in paragraph (c) of  Sec. 20.2014-4. For application of the credit in cases involving a  death tax convention, see Sec. 20.2014-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No credit is allowable under section 2014 in connection with  property situated outside of the foreign country imposing the tax for  which credit is claimed. However, such a credit may be allowable under  certain death tax conventions. In the case of a tax imposed by a  political subdivision of a foreign country, credit for the tax shall be  allowed with respect to property having a situs in that foreign country,  even though, under the principles described in this subparagraph, the  property has a situs in a political subdivision different from the one  imposing the tax. Whether or not particular property of a decedent is  situated in the foreign country imposing the tax is determined in  accordance with the same principles that would be applied in determining  whether or not similar property of a nonresident decedent not a citizen  of the United States is situated within the United States for Federal  estate tax purposes. See Sec. Sec. 20.2104-1 and 20.2105-1. For  example, under Sec. 20.2104-1 shares of stock are deemed to be situated  in the United States only if issued by a domestic corporation. Thus, a  share of corporate stock is regarded as situated in the foreign country  imposing the tax only if the issuing corporation is incorporated in that  country. Further, under Sec. 20.2105-1 amounts receivable as insurance  on the life of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States at the  time of his death are not deemed situated in the United States.  Therefore, in determining the credit under section 2014 in the case of a  decedent who was a citizen or resident of the United States, amounts  receivable as insurance on the life of the decedent and payable under a  policy issued by a corporation incorporated in a foreign country are not  deemed situated in such foreign country. In addition, under Sec.  20.2105-1 in the case of an estate of a nonresident not a citizen of the  United States who died on or after November 14, 1966, a debt obligation  of a domestic corporation is not considered to be situated in the United  States if any interest thereon would be treated under section 862(a)(1)  as income from sources without the United States by reason of section  861(a)(1)(B) (relating to interest received from a domestic corporation  less than 20 percent of whose gross income for a 3-year period was  derived from sources within the United States). Accordingly, a debt  obligation the primary obligor on which is a corporation incorporated in  the foreign country imposing the tax is not considered to be situated in  that country if, under circumstances corresponding to those described in  Sec. 20.2105-1 less than 20 percent of the gross income of the  corporation for the 3-year period was derived from sources within that  country. Further, under Sec. 20.2104-1 in the case of an estate of a  nonresident not a citizen of the United States who died before November  14, 1966, a bond for the payment of money is not situated within the  United States unless it is physically located in the United States.  Accordingly, in the case of the estate of a decedent dying before  November 14, 1966, a bond is deemed situated in the foreign country  imposing the tax only if it is physically located in that country.  Finally, under Sec. 20.2105-1 moneys deposited in the United States  with any person carrying on the banking business by or for a nonresident  not a citizen of the United States who died before November 14, 1966,  and who was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of  death are not deemed situated in the United States. Therefore, an  account with a foreign bank in the foreign country imposing the tax is  not considered to be situated in that country under corresponding  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for foreign  death taxes paid with respect to a charitable gift, the credit for  foreign death taxes is subject to further limitations as explained in  Sec. 20.2014-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on credit. The credit for foreign death taxes is  limited to the smaller of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of a particular foreign death tax attributable to  property situated in the country imposing the tax and included in the  decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes, computed as set  forth in Sec. 20.2014-2; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the Federal estate tax attributable to particular  property situated in a foreign country, subjected to foreign death tax  in that country, and included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal  estate tax purposes, computed as set forth in Sec. 20.2014-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit allowable to estate of resident not a citizen. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the  case of an estate of a decedent dying before November 14, 1966, who was  a resident but not a citizen of the United States, a credit is allowed  to the estate under section 2014 only if the foreign country of which  the decedent was a citizen or subject, in imposing foreign death taxes,  allows a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States  who were resident in that foreign country at the time of death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an estate of a decedent dying on or after  November 14, 1966, who was a resident but not a citizen of the United  States, a credit is allowed to the estate under section 2014 without  regard to the similar credit requirement of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph unless the decedent was a citizen or subject of a foreign  country with respect to which there is in effect at the time of the  decedent's death a Presidential proclamation, as authorized by section  2014(h), reinstating the similar credit requirement. In the case of an  estate of a decedent who was a resident of the United States and a  citizen or subject of a foreign country with respect to which such a  proclamation has been made, and who dies while the proclamation is in  effect, a credit is allowed under section 2014 only if that foreign  country, in imposing foreign death taxes, allows a similar credit to the  estates of citizens of the United States who were resident in that  foreign country at the time of death. The proclamation authorized by  section 2014(h) for the reinstatement of the similar credit requirement  with respect to the estates of citizens or subjects of a specific  foreign country may be made by the President whenever he finds that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The foreign country, in imposing foreign death taxes, does not  allow a similar credit to the estates of citizens of the United States  who were resident in the foreign country at the time of death,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign country, after having been requested to do so, has  not acted to provide a similar credit to the estates of such citizens,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It is in the public interest to allow the credit under section  2014 to the estates of citizens or subjects of the foreign country only  if the foreign country allows a similar credit to the estates of  citizens of the United States who were resident in the foreign country  at the time of death.  The proclamation for the reinstatement of the similar credit requirement  with respect to the estates of citizens or subjects of a specific  foreign country may be revoked by the President. In that case, a credit  is allowed under section 2014, to the estate of a decedent who was a  citizen or subject of that foreign country and a resident of the United  States at the time of death, without regard to the similar credit  requirement if the decedent dies after the proclamation reinstating the  similar credit requirement has been revoked.

Thus, the credit for any foreign death tax is limited to  an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the amount of the foreign  death tax without allowance of credit, if any, for Federal estate tax),  as C (the value of the property situated in the country imposing the  foreign death tax, subjected to the foreign death tax, included in the  gross estate and for which a deduction is not allowed under section  2053(d)) bears to D (the value of all property subjected to   the foreign death tax). Stated algebraically, the ``first limitation''  (A) equals--</p><p class="depth0">Value of property in foreign country subjected to foreign death tax,  included in gross estate and for which a deduction is not allowed under  section 2053(d)(C) / Value of all property subjected to foreign death  tax (D) x Amount of foreign death tax (B)   The values used in this proportion are the values determined for the  purpose of the foreign death tax. The amount of the foreign death tax  for which credit is allowable must be converted into United States  money. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. At the time of his death on June 1, 1966, the decedent, a  citizen of the United States, owned stock in X Corporation (a  corporation organized under the laws of Country Y) valued at $80,000. In  addition, he owned bonds issued by Country Y valued at $80,000. The  stock and bond certificates were in the United States. Decedent left by  will $20,000 of the stock and $50,000 of the Country Y bonds to his  surviving spouse. He left the rest of the stock and bonds to his son.  Under the situs rules referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 20.2014-1  the stock is deemed situated in Country Y while the bonds are deemed to  have their situs in the United States. (The bonds would be deemed to  have their situs in Country Y if the decedent had died on or after  November 14, 1966.) There is not death tax convention in existence  between the United States and Country Y. The laws of Country Y provide  for inheritance taxes computed as follows:  Inheritance tax of surviving spouse:</p><p class="depth0">Value of stock..............................................   $20,000</p><p class="depth0">Value of bonds..............................................    50,000</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total value.................................................    70,000</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Tax (16 percent rate).......................................    11,200</p><p class="depth0">========= Inheritance tax of son:</p><p class="depth0">Value of stock..............................................    60,000 Value of bonds................................................   $30,000</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total value................................................    90,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Tax (16 percent rate).........................................    14,400</p><p class="depth0">=========</p><p class="depth0">The ``first limitation'' on the credit for foreign death taxes is:  $20,000 + $60,000 (factor C of the ratio stated at Sec. 20.2014-2(a)) /</p><p class="depth0">$70,000+ $90,000 (factor D of the ratio stated at Sec.</p><p class="depth0">20.2014-2(a)) x ($11,200+$14,400) (factor B of the ratio</p><p class="depth0">stated at Sec. 20.2014-2(a)) = $12,800</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a foreign country imposes more than one kind of death tax or  imposes taxes at different rates upon the several shares of an estate,  or if a foreign country and a political subdivision or possession  thereof each imposes a death tax, a ``first limitation'' is to be  computed separately for each tax or rate and the results added in order  to determine the total ``first limitation.''

Factor ``G'' of the ratio is determined by taking into  consideration the   combined value of the foreign property which is subjected to each  different tax or different rate. The combined value, however, cannot  exceed the value at which such property was included in the gross estate  for Federal estate tax purposes. Thus, if Country X imposes a tax on the  inheritance of a surviving spouse at a 10-percent rate and on the  inheritance of a son at a 20-percent rate, the combined value of their  inheritances is taken into consideration in determining factor ``G'' of  the ratio, which is then used in computing the ``second limitation.''  However, the ``first limitation'' is computed as provided in paragraph  (b) of Sec. 20.2014-2. The lesser of the ``first limitation'' and the  ``second limitation'' is the credit for foreign death taxes.
