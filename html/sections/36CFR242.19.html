                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emergency special actions. In an emergency situation, if  necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife  population, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for  public safety reasons, the Board may immediately open or close public  lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or  modify the requirements for take for subsistence uses, or close public  lands to take for nonsubsistence uses of fish and wildlife, or restrict  the requirements for take for nonsubsistence uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected  Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board may  seek Council recommendations on the proposed emergency special action.  Such a Council recommendation, if any, will be subject to the  requirements of Sec. 242.18(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emergency action will be effective when directed by the  Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless the  procedures for adoption of a temporary special action, as set forth in  paragraph (b) of this section, have been followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temporary special actions. After adequate notice and public  hearing, the Board may temporarily close or open public lands for the  taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the  requirements for subsistence take, or close public lands for the taking  of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses, or restrict take for  nonsubsistence uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board may make such temporary changes only after it  determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with  the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be  detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife  resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence  users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if  new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no  longer warranted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to implementing a temporary special action, the Board will  consult with the State of Alaska and the Chairs of the Regional Councils  of the affected regions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected  Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board  will seek Council recommendations on the proposed temporary special  action. Such Council recommendations, if any, will be subject to the  requirements of Sec. 242.18(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The length of any temporary action will be confined to the  minimum   time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be necessary  under the circumstances. In any event, a temporary opening or closure  will not extend longer than the end of the current regulatory cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board may reject a request for either an emergency or a  temporary special action if the Board concludes that there are no time- sensitive circumstances necessitating a regulatory change before the  next regular proposal cycle. However, a special action request that has  been rejected for this reason may be deferred, if appropriate and after  consultation with the proponent, for consideration during the next  regular proposal cycle. The Board will consider changes to customary and  traditional use determinations in subpart C of this part only during the  regular proposal cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Board will provide notice of all regulatory changes adopted  via special action by posting the change on the Office of Subsistence  Management Web site (http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/index.cfml). When  appropriate, notice may also include distribution of press releases to  newspapers, local radio stations, and local contacts, as well as direct  notification to the proponent and interested parties. The Board will  publish notice and reasons justifying the special action in the Federal  Register as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The decision of the Board on any proposed special action will  constitute its final administrative action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Regulations authorizing any individual agency to implement  closures or restrictions on public lands managed by the agency remain  unaffected by the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fish and wildlife may not be taken in violation of any  restriction, closure, or change authorized by the Board.
