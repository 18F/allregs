                            <p class="depth0">This part applies to any program for which financial assistance is  provided by TVA. The types of Federal financial assistance to which this  part applies are listed in appendix A of this part. Financial  assistance, as used in this part, includes the grant or loan of money;  the donation of real or personal property; the sale, lease, or license  of real or personal property for a consideration which is nominal or  reduced for the purpose of assisting the recipient; the waiver of  charges which would normally be made, in order to assist the   recipient; the entry into a contract where a purpose is to give  financial assistance to the contracting party; and similar transactions.  This part does not apply to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty  contracts,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended  before the effective date of this part,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate  beneficiary, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any employment practice, under any such program, of any  employer, employment agency, or labor organization, unless such practice  exists in a program where a primary objective of the TVA financial  assistance is to provide employment; or where such practice subjects  persons to discrimination in the provision of services and benefits on  the grounds of race, color, or national origin in a program or activity  receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA.  The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in  appendix A shall not mean, if Title VI of the Act is otherwise  applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal  financial assistance may be added to this list by notice published in  the Federal Register.  [30 FR 311, Jan. 9, 1965.
