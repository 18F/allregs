For the purpose of this chapter, VA will consider any rate of pursuit higher than 50 percent to be more than one-half time training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Measurement of courses reported in credit hours. If the courses are measured in credit hours, then the number of credit hours the individual is taking in a term, quarter, or semester will be divided by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester at the institution of higher learning as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement of courses reported in clock hours. If the courses are measured in clock hours, VA will--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Convert the clock hours to equivalent credit hours by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adding the total number of clock hours pursued during the term, quarter or semester;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dividing the sum of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by the total number of weeks in the term; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section rounded to the nearest hundredth by--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the institution of higher learning measures courses using both credit and clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing the number of credit hours considered full-time at the institution by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the institution of higher learning only measures courses using clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing 14 credit hours by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Divide the result of paragraph (b)(1) rounded to the nearest hundredth by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
