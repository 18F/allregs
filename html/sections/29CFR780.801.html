Section 13(b)(15) supplants two exemptions that were contained in the  Act prior to the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966. The first is  former section 13(a)(18), having identical language, which provided a  complete exemption for those employed in the ginning of cotton. The  second is the former section 7(c) which provided an overtime exemption  for the employees of an employer engaged in sugar processing operations  resulting in unrefined sugar or syrup.</p>
