If an individual is entitled for any month after August 1965 to  a widow's or widower's insurance benefit under the provisions of section  202 (e)(4) or (f)(5) of the Act and to any other monthly benefit payable  under the provisions of title II of the Act (see subpart D) for the same  month, except an old-age insurance benefit, such other insurance benefit  for that month, after any reduction under paragraph (a) of this section,  any reduction for age under section 202(q) of the Act, and any reduction  under the provisions described in section 203(a) of the Act, shall be  reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such widow's or  widower's insurance benefit after any reduction or reductions under  paragraph (a) of this section or section 203(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, or (d) may make  the above described election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Child's insurance benefits. A child may, for any month, be  simultaneously entitled to a child's insurance benefit on more than one  individual's earnings if all the conditions for entitlement described in  Sec. 404.350 are met with respect to each claim. Where a child is  simultaneously entitled to child's insurance benefits on more than one  earnings record, the general rule is that the child will be paid an  amount which is based on the record having the highest primary insurance  amount. However, the child will be paid a higher amount which is based  on the earnings record having a lower primary insurance amount if no  other beneficiary entitled on any record would receive a lower benefit  because the child is paid on the record with the lower primary insurance  amount. (See Sec. 404.353(b).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(4)</em> or (f)(5) of the Act  applies is entitled to only one such benefit for such month, such  benefit to be the largest of such benefits.
