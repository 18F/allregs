                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The policies and procedures in 47.304-1, -2, and -3 govern the  transportation of supplies from sources in the Contiguous United States  (CONUS), except when identifiable costs, nature of the supplies  (security, safety, or value), delivery requirements (premium modes of  transport, escorts, transit arrangements, and tentative conditions), or  other advantages, limitations, or requirements dictate otherwise. The  policies and procedures in 47.304-4 govern the transportation of  supplies from sources outside CONUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, the contracting officer shall solicit offers, and  award contracts, with delivery terms on the basis prescribed in 47.304.  The contracting officer shall document the contract file (see 4.801)  with justifications for solicitations that do not specify delivery on  the basis prescribed in 47.304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The place of performance of Government acquisition quality  assurance actions and the place of acceptance shall not control the  delivery term, except that if acceptance is at destination,  transportation shall be f.o.b. destination (see 47.304-1(f)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fact that transportation is f.o.b. destination does not  alone necessitate changing the place of acceptance from origin to  destination; and the fact that acceptance is at origin does not  necessitate an f.o.b. origin delivery term. Providing for inspection and  acceptance at origin (if appropriate under 46.402), in conjunction with  an f.o.b. destination term, may be advantageous to both the Government  and the contractor. Acceptance of title at origin by the Government  permits payment of the contractor, provided the invoice is supported  either by a copy of the signed commercial bill of lading (indicating the  carrier's receipt of the supplies covered by the invoice for  transportation to the particular destination specified in the contract)  or by other   appropriate evidence of shipment to the particular destination for the  contractor's account.
