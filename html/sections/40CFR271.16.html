Criminal fines shall be recoverable in at least the amount of $10,000  per day for each violation, and imprisonment for at least six months  shall be available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum civil penalty or criminal fines (as provided in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be assessable for each instance  of violation and, if the violation is continuous, shall be assessable up  to the maximum amount for each day of violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The burden of proof and degree of knowledge or intent required  under State law for establishing violations under paragraph (a)(3) of  this section, shall be no greater than the burden of proof or degree of  knowledge or intent EPA must provide when it brings an action under the  Act.</p><p class="depth3">Note: For example, this requirement is not met if State law includes  mental state as an element of proof for civil violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A civil penalty assessed, sought, or agreed upon by the State  Director under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be appropriate to  the violation.</p><p class="depth2">Note: To the extent the State judgments or settlements provide  penalties in amounts which EPA believes to be substantially inadequate  in comparison to the amounts which EPA would require under similar  facts, EPA, when authorized by the applicable statute, may commence  separate actions for penalties.</p><p class="depth2">In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, the State may  have other enforcement remedies. The following enforcement options,  while not mandatory, are highly recommended:</p><p class="depth2">Procedures for assessment by the State of the costs of  investigations, inspections, or monitoring surveys which lead to the  establishment of violations;</p><p class="depth2">Procedures which enable the State to assess or to sue any persons  responsible for unauthorized activities for any expenses incurred by the  State in removing, correcting, or terminating any adverse effects upon  human health and the environment resulting from the unauthorized  activity, whether or not accidental;</p><p class="depth2">Procedures which enable the State to sue for compensation for any  loss or destruction of wildlife, fish or aquatic life, or their habitat,  and for any other damages caused by unauthorized activity, either to the  State or to any residents of the State who are directly aggrieved by the  unauthorized activity, or both; and</p><p class="depth2">Procedures for the administrative assessment of penalties by the  Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any State administering a program under this subpart shall  provide for public participation in the State enforcement process by  providing either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authority which allows intervention as of right in any civil  action to obtain the remedies specified in paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of  this section by any citizen having an interest which is or may be  adversely affected; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assurance by the appropriate State agency that it will  investigate and provide written responses to all citizen complaints  submitted pursuant to the procedures specified in Sec.  271.15(b)(4);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assurance by the appropriate State enforcement authority that  it will not oppose intervention by any citizen when permissive  intervention is authorized by statute, rule, or regulation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assurance by the appropriate State enforcement authority that  it will publish notice of and provide at least 30 days for public  comment on all proposed settlements of civil enforcement actions, except  in cases where a settlement requires some immediate action (e.g.,  cleanup) which if otherwise delayed could result in substantial damage  to either public health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any State authority used to issue an enforceable document either  in lieu of a post-closure permit as provided in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7), or  as a source of alternative requirements for regulated units, as provided  under 40 CFR 264.90(f), 264.110(c), 264.140(d), 265.90(d), 265.110(d),  and 265.140(d), shall have available the following remedies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authority to sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin  any threatened or continuing violation of the requirements of such  documents, as well as authority to compel compliance with requirements  for corrective action or other emergency response measures deemed  necessary to protect human health and the environment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authority to access or sue to recover in court civil penalties,  including fines, for violations of requirements in such documents.
