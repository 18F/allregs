                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A partner's treatment of partnership items on the partner's return may not be changed except as provided in sections 6222 through 6231 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, if a partner treats an item on the partner's return consistently with the treatment of the item on the partnership return, the IRS generally cannot adjust the treatment of that item on the partner's return except through a partnership-level proceeding. Similarly, the taxpayer may not put partnership items in issue in a proceeding relating to nonpartnership items. For example, the taxpayer may not offset a potential increase in taxable income based on changes to nonpartnership items by a potential decrease based on partnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions inapplicable after items become nonpartnership items. Section 6221 and paragraph (a) of this section cease to apply to items arising from a partnership with respect to a partner when those items cease to be partnership items with respect to that partner under section 6231(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Penalties determined at partnership level. Any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level.

Partner-level defenses to such items can only be asserted through refund actions following assessment and payment. Assessment of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item shall be made based on partnership-level determinations. Partnership-level determinations include all the legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount, other than partner-level defenses specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Partner-level defenses. Partner-level defenses to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item may not be asserted in the partnership-level proceeding, but may be asserted through separate refund actions following assessment and payment. See section 6230(c)(4). Partner-level defenses are limited to those that are personal to the partner or are dependent upon the partner's separate return and cannot be determined at the partnership level. Examples of these determinations are whether any applicable threshold underpayment of tax has been met with respect to the partner or whether the partner has met the criteria of section 6664(b) (penalties applicable only where return is filed), or section 6664(c)(1) (reasonable cause exception) subject to partnership-level determinations as to the applicability of section 6664(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Cross-references. See Sec. Sec. 301.6231(c)-1 and 301.6231(c)-2 for special rules relating to certain applications and claims for refund based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6221-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6222(a)-1  Consistent treatment of partnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The treatment of a partnership item on the partner's return must be consistent with the treatment of that item by the partnership on the partnership return in all respects including the amount, timing, and characterization of the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment must be consistent with partnership return. The treatment of a partnership item on the partner's return must be consistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return. Thus, a partner who treats an item consistently with a schedule or other information furnished to the partner by the partnership has not satisfied the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section if the treatment of that item is inconsistent with the treatment of the item on the partnership return actually filed. For rules relating to the election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency where the partner treats an item consistently with an incorrect schedule, see Sec. 301.6222(b)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B is a partner of Partnership P. Both B and P use the calendar year as the taxable year. In December 2001, P receives an advance payment for services to be performed in 2002 and reports this amount as income for calendar year 2001. However, B reports B's distributive share of this amount on B's income tax return for 2002 and not on B's return for 2001. B's treatment of this partnership item is inconsistent with the treatment of the item by P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Partnership P incurred certain start-up costs before P was actively engaged in its business. P capitalized these costs. C, a partner in P, deducted C's proportionate share of these start-up costs. C's treatment of the partnership expenditure is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. D is a partner in partnership P. P reports a loss of $100,000 on its return, $5,000 of which it reports on the Schedule K-1 attached to its return as D's distributive share. However, P reports $15,000 as D's distributive share of P's loss on the Schedule K-1 furnished to D. D reports the $15,000 loss on D's income tax return. D has not satisfied the consistent reporting requirement. See, however, Sec. 301.6222(b)-3 for an election to be treated as having reported the inconsistency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001.</p><p class="depth0">For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6222(a)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6222(a)-2  Application of consistent reporting andnotification rules to indirect partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The consistent reporting requirement of Sec. 301.6222(a)-1 is generally applied with respect to the source partnership. For purposes of this section, the term source partnership means the partnership (within the meaning of section 6231(a)(1)) from which the partnership item originates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect partner files consistently with source partnership. An indirect partner who treats an item from a source partnership in a manner consistent with the treatment of that item on the source partnership's return satisfies the consistency requirement of section 6222(a) regardless of whether the indirect partner treats that item in a manner consistent with the treatment of that item by the pass-thru partner through which the indirect partner holds the interest in the source partnership. Under these circumstances, therefore, the Internal Revenue Service shall not send to the indirect partner the notice described in section 6231(b)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Indirect partner files inconsistently with source partnership--(1) Indirect partner notifies the Internal Revenue Service of inconsistency. An indirect partner who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indirect partner notifies the Internal Revenue Service of inconsistency. An indirect partner who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treats an item from a source partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the source partnership's return; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Files a statement identifying the inconsistency with the source partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(c)-1, shall not be subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item to the treatment of that item on the return of the source partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indirect partner does not notify the Internal Revenue Service of inconsistency. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an indirect partner who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treats an item from a source partnership in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the source partnership's return; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fails to file a statement identifying the inconsistency with the source partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(b)-1, is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item to the treatment of that item on the return of the source partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect partner files consistently with a pass-thru partner that notifies the Internal Revenue Service of the inconsistency. If an indirect partner treats an item from a source partnership in a manner consistent with the treatment of that item by a pass-thru partner through which the indirect partner holds the interest in the source partnership and that pass-thru partner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treats that item in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the source partnership's return; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Files a statement identifying the inconsistency with the source partnership in accordance with Sec. 301.6222(b)-1, the indirect partner is not subject to a computational adjustment to conform to the treatment of that item on the return of the source partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. One of the partners in Partnership A is Partnership B, which has four equal partners C, D, E, and F. Both A and B are partnerships within the meaning of section 6231(a)(1). On its return, A reports $100,000 as B's distributive share of A's ordinary income. B, however, reports only $80,000 as its distributive share of the income and does not notify the Internal Revenue Service of this inconsistent treatment with respect to A. C reports $20,000 as its distributive share of the item. Although C reports the item consistently with B, C is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item on C's return to the treatment of that item on A's return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that B notified the Internal Revenue Service of its inconsistent treatment with respect to source partnership A. C is not subject to a computational adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. D reports only $15,000 as D's distributive share of the income and does not report the inconsistency. F reports only $9,000 as its distributive share of the item but reports this inconsistency with respect to source partnership A. D is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item on D's return to the treatment of that item on A's return. F is not subject to a computational adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that F reported the inconsistency with respect to B and did not report the

inconsistency with respect to source partnership A. F is subject to a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of that item on F's return to the treatment of that item on A's return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. E reports $25,000 as its distributive share of the item. Regardless of whether E reports the inconsistency between its treatment of the item and that by B, E is neither subject to a computational adjustment to conform E's treatment of that item to that of B nor subject to the notice described in section 6231(b)(1)(A) with respect to any such notification of inconsistent treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6222(a)-2T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6222(b)-1  Notification to the Internal Revenue Servicewhen partnership items are treated inconsistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The statement identifying an inconsistency described in section 6222(b)(1)(B) shall be filed by filing the form prescribed for that purpose in accordance with the instructions accompanying that form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6222(b)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6222(b)-2  Effect of notification of inconsistent treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Generally, if a partner treats a partnership item on the partner's return in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of that item on the partnership return, the Internal Revenue Service may make a computational adjustment to conform the treatment of the item by the partner with the treatment of that item on the partnership return. Any additional tax resulting from that computational adjustment may be assessed without either the commencement of a partnership proceeding or notification to the partner that all partnership items arising from that partnership will be treated as nonpartnership items. However, if a partner notifies the Internal Revenue Service of the inconsistent treatment of a partnership item in the manner prescribed in Sec. 301.6222(b)-1, the Internal Revenue Service generally may not make an adjustment with respect to that partnership item unless the Internal Revenue Service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conducts a partnership-level proceeding; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notifies the partner under section 6231(b)(1)(A) that all partnership items arising from that partnership will be treated as nonpartnership items. See, however, Sec. Sec. 301.6231(c)-1 and 301.6231(c)-2 for special rules relating to certain applications and claims for refund based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Partner protected only to extent of notification. (1) A partner who reports the inconsistent treatment of partnership items on the partner's return is protected from computational adjustments under section 6222(c) only with respect to those partnership items the inconsistent treatment of which is reported. Thus, if a partner notifying the Internal Revenue Service with respect to one item fails to report the inconsistent treatment of another item, the partner is subject to a computational adjustment with respect to that other item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A partner who reports the inconsistent treatment of partnership items on the partner's return is protected from computational adjustments under section 6222(c) only with respect to those partnership items the inconsistent treatment of which is reported. Thus, if a partner notifying the Internal Revenue Service with respect to one item fails to report the inconsistent treatment of another item, the partner is subject to a computational adjustment with respect to that other item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partner A of Partnership P treats a deduction and a capital gain arising from P on A's return in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of those items by P. A reports the inconsistent treatment of the deduction but not of the gain. A is subject to a computational adjustment under section 6222(c) with respect to the gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments in a separate proceeding not limited to conforming adjustments. (1) If the Internal Revenue Service conducts a separate proceeding with a partner whose partnership items are treated as nonpartnership items under section 6231(b), the Internal Revenue Service is not limited to making adjustments that merely conform the partner's return to the partnership return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the Internal Revenue Service conducts a separate proceeding with a partner whose partnership items are treated as nonpartnership items under section 6231(b), the Internal Revenue Service is not limited to making adjustments that merely conform the partner's return to the partnership return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership P allocates to E, one of its partners, a loss of $8,000. E, however, claims a loss of $9,000 and reports the inconsistent treatment. The Internal Revenue Service notifies E that it will treat all of E's partnership items arising from P as nonpartnership items. As a result of a separate proceeding with E, the Internal Revenue Service may issue a deficiency notice which could include reducing the loss to $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6222(b)-2T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6222(b)-3  Partner receiving incorrect schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A partner shall be treated as having complied with section 6222(b)(1)(B) and Sec. 301.6222(b)-1 with respect to a partnership item if the partner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Demonstrates that the treatment of the partnership item on the partner's return is consistent with the treatment of that item on the schedule prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service and furnished to the partner by the partnership showing the partner's share of income, credits, deductions, etc.; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elects in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section to have this section apply with respect to that item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election provisions--(1) Time and manner of making election. The election described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office issuing the notice of computational adjustment within 30 days after the notice is mailed to the partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office issuing the notice of computational adjustment within 30 days after the notice is mailed to the partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of statement. The statement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clearly identified as an election under section 6222(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Signed by the partner making the election; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accompanied by copies of the schedule furnished to the partner by the partnership and of the notice of computational adjustment. The partner need not enclose a copy of the notice of computational adjustment, however, if the partner clearly identifies the notice of computational adjustment. Generally, the requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be satisfied by attaching to the statement a copy of the schedule furnished to the partner by the partnership. However, if it is not clear from the information contained on the schedule that the treatment of the partnership item on the schedule is consistent with the partner's treatment of such item on the partner's return the statement shall also include an explanation of how the treatment of such item on the schedule is consistent with the treatment on the partner's return with respect to the characterization, timing, and amount of such item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6223(a)-1  Notice sent to tax matters partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code, a notice is treated as mailed to the tax matters partner on the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date on which the notice is mailed to ``THE TAX MATTERS PARTNER'' at the address of the partnership (as provided on the partnership return, except as updated under Sec. 301.6223(c)-1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date on which the notice is mailed to the person who is the tax matters partner at the address of that person (as provided on the partner's return, except as updated under Sec. 301.6223(c)-1) or the partnership. See Sec. 301.6223(c)-1 for rules relating to the information used by the Internal Revenue Service in providing notices, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership P designates B as its tax matters partner in accordance with Sec. 301.6231(a)(7)-1(b). On December 1 a notice of the beginning of an administrative proceeding is mailed to ``THE TAX MATTERS PARTNER'' at the address of P. On January

10, a copy of the notice is mailed to B at B's address. December 1 is treated as the date that the notice was mailed to the tax matters partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6223(a)-2  Withdrawal of notice of the beginning of anadministrative proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the Internal Revenue Service, within 45 days after the day on which the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) is mailed to the tax matters partner, decides not to propose any adjustments to the partnership return as filed, the Internal Revenue Service may withdraw the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) by mailing a letter to that effect to the tax matters partner within that 45-day period. Even if the Internal Revenue Service does not withdraw the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1), the Internal Revenue Service is not required to issue a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment. If the Internal Revenue Service withdraws the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1), neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the tax matters partner is required to furnish any notice with respect to that proceeding to any other partner. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) which has been withdrawn shall be treated for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code as if that notice had never been mailed to the tax matters partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Internal Revenue Service may not reissue notice except under certain circumstances. If the notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) was mailed to the tax matters partner with respect to a partnership taxable year and that notice was later withdrawn as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service shall not mail a second notice specified in section 6223(a)(1) with respect to that taxable year unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is evidence of fraud, malfeasance, collusion, concealment, or misrepresentation of a material fact;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prior proceeding involved the misapplication or erroneous interpretation of an established Internal Revenue Service position existing at the time of the previous examination, or the failure to make an adjustment based on such a position; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other circumstances exist which indicate that failure to reissue the notice would be a serious administrative omission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6223(b)-1  Notice group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a group of partners having in the aggregate a 5 percent or more interest in the profits of a partnership requests and designates one of their members to receive the notices described in section 6223(a)(1) and (2), the member so designated shall be treated as a partner to whom section 6223(a) applies.

In addition, Z was identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1 on May 1, 2002. The Internal Revenue Service mailed a notice to the tax matters partner of ABC on July 1, 2002, but failed to provide notice to partnership A. Notwithstanding the Internal

Revenue Service's notice to the tax matters partner, the Internal Revenue Service is deemed to have failed to provide notice to X and Y.

In the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of fact, if the tax matters partner enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to partnership items, including partnership-level determinations relating to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amounts that relate to adjustments to partnership items, and expressly states that the agreement shall be binding on the other partners, then that agreement shall be binding on all partners except those who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Are, as of the day on which the agreement is entered into, either notice partners or members of a notice group (see Sec. 301.6223(b)-1(c)(4) for the date on which a partner becomes a member of a notice group); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Have, at least 30 days before the day on which the agreement is entered into, filed with the Internal Revenue Service the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect partners--(1) In general. If, under paragraph (a) of this section, a pass-thru partner is not bound by an agreement entered into by the tax matters partner, all indirect partners holding an interest in the partnership through that pass-thru partner shall not be bound by that agreement. If, however, the pass-thru partner is bound by an agreement entered into by the tax matters partner, paragraph (a) of this section shall be applied separately to each indirect partner holding an interest in the partnership through the pass-thru partner to determine whether the indirect partner is also bound by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If, under paragraph (a) of this section, a pass-thru partner is not bound by an agreement entered into by the tax matters partner, all indirect partners holding an interest in the partnership through that pass-thru partner shall not be bound by that agreement. If, however, the pass-thru partner is bound by an agreement entered into by the tax matters partner, paragraph (a) of this section shall be applied separately to each indirect partner holding an interest in the partnership through the pass-thru partner to determine whether the indirect partner is also bound by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership P has over 100 partners. Partnership J is a partner in partnership P with a profits interest of less than 1 percent. Partnership J has three partners, A, B, and C. A is a member of a notice group with respect to partnership P, but B and C are not. On July 1, 2002, B filed the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section not to be bound by any settlement agreement entered into by the tax matters partner of partnership P. On August 1, 2002, the tax matters partner of partnership P enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and states that the agreement is binding on other partners as provided in section 6224(c)(3). Because partnership J is bound by the settlement agreement, paragraph (a) of this section is applied separately to each of the indirect partners to determine whether they are bound. A is not bound by the agreement because A was a member of a notice group on the day the agreement was entered into and B is not bound because B filed the statement not to be bound at least 30 days before the agreement was entered into. C is bound by the settlement agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Statement not to be bound--(1) Contents of statement.

The statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section generally shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service service center where the partnership return is filed. However, if the partner knows that the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters partner, the statement shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed that notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consolidated statements. The statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be filed with respect to more than one partner if the requirements of that paragraph (c)(1) (including signatures) are satisfied with respect to each partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6224(c)-2  Pass-thru partner binds indirect partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pass-thru partner binds unidentified indirect partners--(1) In general. If a pass-thru partner enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to partnership items, that agreement binds all indirect partners holding an interest in that partnership through the pass-thru partner except those indirect partners who have been identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1 at least 30 days before the date on which the agreement is entered into. A settlement with respect to partnership items includes partnership-level determinations relating to any penalty, addition to tax, and additional amounts that relate to adjustments to partnership items. However, if, in addition to the interest in the partnership held through the pass-thru partner entering into a settlement agreement, an indirect partner holds a separate interest in that partnership, either directly or indirectly through a different pass-thru partner, then the indirect partner shall not be bound by that settlement agreement with respect to the interests held directly or indirectly through a pass-thru partner other than the pass-thru partner entering into the settlement agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

A settlement with respect to partnership items includes partnership-level determinations relating to any penalty, addition to tax, and additional amounts that relate to adjustments to partnership items. However, if, in addition to the interest in the partnership held through the pass-thru partner entering into a settlement agreement, an indirect partner holds a separate interest in that partnership, either directly or indirectly through a different pass-thru partner, then the indirect partner shall not be bound by that settlement agreement with respect to the interests held directly or indirectly through a pass-thru partner other than the pass-thru partner entering into the settlement agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Partnership J is a partner in partnership P. C is a partner in J but has not been identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and Sec. 301.6223(c)-1. The only interest that C holds in P is through J.

Sec. 301.6224(c)-3  Consistent settlements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the Internal Revenue Service enters into a settlement agreement with any partner with respect to partnership items, whether comprehensive or partial, the Internal Revenue Service shall offer to any other partner who so requests in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, settlement terms consistent with those contained in the settlement agreement entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for consistent settlement terms--(1) In general. Consistent settlement terms are those based on the same determinations with respect to partnership items. However, consistent settlement terms also may include partnership-level determinations of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to partnership items. Settlements with respect to partnership items shall be self-contained; thus, a concession by one party with respect to a partnership item may not be based upon a concession by another party with respect to any item that is not a partnership item other than a partnership-level determination of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. Consistent agreements must be identical to the original settlement (that is, the settlement upon which the offered settlement terms are based). A consistent agreement must mirror the original settlement and may not be limited to selected items from the original settlement. Once a partner has settled a partnership item, or a partnership-level determination of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item, that partner may not subsequently request settlement terms consistent with a settlement that contains the previously settled item. The requirement for consistent settlement terms applies only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Consistent settlement terms are those based on the same determinations with respect to partnership items. However, consistent settlement terms also may include partnership-level determinations of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to partnership items. Settlements with respect to partnership items shall be self-contained; thus, a concession by one party with respect to a partnership item may not be based upon a concession by another party with respect to any item that is not a partnership item other than a partnership-level determination of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.

Once a partner has settled a partnership item, or a partnership-level determination of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item, that partner may not subsequently request settlement terms consistent with a settlement that contains the previously settled item. The requirement for consistent settlement terms applies only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The items were partnership items (or a partnership-level determination of any related penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount) for the partner entering into the original settlement immediately before the original settlement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The items are partnership items (or a partnership-level determination of any related penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount) for the partner requesting the consistent settlement at the time the partner files the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of consistent agreement. Consistent settlement terms are reflected in a consistent agreement. A consistent agreement is not a settlement agreement that gives rise to further consistent settlement rights because it is required to be given without volitional agreement of the Secretary. Therefore, a consistent agreement required to be offered to a requesting taxpayer is not a settlement agreement under section 6224(c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section which starts a new period for requesting consistent settlement terms. For all other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, however, (e.g., binding effect under section 6224(c)(1) and conversion to nonpartnership items under section 6231(b)(1)(C)), a consistent agreement is treated as a settlement agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner of requesting consistent settlements--(1) In general. A partner desiring settlement terms consistent with the terms of any settlement agreement entered into between any other partner and the Internal Revenue Service shall submit a written statement to the Internal Revenue Service office that entered into the settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A partner desiring settlement terms consistent with the terms of any settlement agreement entered into between any other partner and the Internal Revenue Service shall submit a written statement to the Internal Revenue Service office that entered into the settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of statement. Except as otherwise provided in instructions to the taxpayer from the Internal Revenue Service, the written statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify the statement as a request for consistent settlement terms under section 6224(c)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the partnership and of the partner requesting the settlement offer (and, in the case of an indirect partner, of the pass-thru partner through which the indirect partner holds an interest);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify the earlier agreement to which the request refers; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Be signed by the partner making the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time for filing request. The statement shall be filed not later than the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The 150th day after the day on which the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment is mailed to the tax matters partner; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 60th day after the day on which the settlement agreement was entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The Internal Revenue Service seeks to disallow a $100,000 loss reported by Partnership P $20,000 of which was allocated to partner X, and $10,000 of which was allocated to partner Y. The Internal Revenue Service agrees to a settlement with X in which the Internal Revenue Service allows $12,000 of the loss, accepts the treatment of all other partnership items on the partnership return, and imposes a penalty for negligence related to the $8,000 loss disallowance. Partner Y requests settlement terms consistent with the settlement made between X and the Internal Revenue Service. The items are partnership items (or a related penalty) for X immediately before X enters into the settlement agreement and are partnership items (or a related penalty) for Y at the time of the request. The Internal Revenue Service must offer Y settlement terms allowing a $6,000 loss, a negligence penalty on the $4,000 disallowance, and otherwise reflecting the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. F files inconsistently with Partnership P and reports the inconsistency. The Internal Revenue Service notifies F that it will treat all partnership items arising from P as nonpartnership items with respect to F. Later, the Internal Revenue Service enters into a settlement with F on these items. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to offer the other partners of P settlement terms consistent with the settlement reached between F and the Internal Revenue Service because the items arising from P are not partnership items with respect to F.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. G, a partner in Partnership P, filed suit under section 6228(b) after the Internal Revenue Service failed to allow an administrative adjustment request with respect to a partnership item arising from P for a taxable year. Under section 6231(b)(1)(B), the partnership items of G for the partnership taxable year became nonpartnership items as of the date G filed suit. After G filed suit, another partner and the Internal Revenue Service entered into a settlement agreement with respect to items arising from P in that year. G is not entitled to consistent settlement terms because, at the time of the settlement, the items arising from P are no longer partnership items with respect to G.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001.

Sec. 301.6226(a)-1  Principal place of business of partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The principal place of a partnership's business for purposes of determining the appropriate district court in which a petition for a readjustment of partnership items may be filed is its principal place of business as of the date the petition is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The principal place of Partnership A's business on the day that the notice of the final partnership administrative adjustment was mailed to A's tax matters partner was Cincinnati, Ohio. However, by the day on which a petition seeking judicial review of that adjustment was filed, A had moved its principal place of business to Louisville, Kentucky.

The partner is not required to pay other outstanding liabilities in order to deposit a jurisdictional amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The jurisdictional amount that the filing partner (or, in the case of a petition filed by a 5-percent group, each member of the group, or, for civil actions beginning on or after April 2, 2002, in the case of a petition filed by a pass-thru partner, each indirect partner holding an interest through the pass-thru partner) shall deposit is the amount by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased if the treatment of the partnership items on the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment. The partner is not required to pay other outstanding liabilities in order to deposit a jurisdictional amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A files a petition for readjustment of partnership items in the United States Court of Federal Claims. A's tax liability would be increased by $4,000 if partnership items on A's return were conformed to the partnership return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment. A has an unpaid liability of $10,000 attributable to nonpartnership items. A is required to deposit $4,000 in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deposit taken into account in computing interest. The amount deposited is treated as a payment of tax for purposes of chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to interest).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deposit generally not treated as payment of tax. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an amount deposited under section 6226(e) shall not be treated as a payment of tax.

If the restriction on assessment provided under section 6225(a) lapses with respect to a deficiency attributable to partnership items for a partnership taxable year while an amount is on deposit under section 6226(e) in connection with a petition relating to those items, the Internal Revenue Service may apply the amount deposited against any such deficiency that is assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6226(f)-1  Scope of judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A court reviewing a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment has jurisdiction to determine all partnership items for the taxable year to which the notice relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners. Thus, the review is not limited to the items adjusted in the notice. In addition, the court has jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to determine any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, the court does not have jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to consider any partner-level defenses to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. See section 6230(c)(4) and Sec. 301.6221-1(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example.

In the case of amounts received or accrued that relate to the disposition of property, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, gross income means the excess of the amount realized from the disposition of the property over the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property.

Sec. 301.6229(f)-1  Special rule for partial settlement agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a partner enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the treatment of some of the partnership items or partnership-level determinations of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount in dispute for a partnership taxable year, but one or more other partnership items or determinations remain in dispute, the period of limitations for assessing any tax attributable to the settled items shall be determined as if such agreement had not been entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other items remaining in dispute. Pursuant to section 6226(c), a partner is a party to a partnership-level judicial proceeding with respect to partnership items and partnership-level determinations of penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts. When a partner settles partnership items, the settled partnership items convert to nonpartnership items under section 6231(b)(1)(C) and will not be subject to any future or pending partnership-level proceeding pursuant to section 6226(d)(1). The remaining unsettled partnership items, as well as any unsettled penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item (regardless of whether the partnership item to which it relates has been settled), however, will remain subject to determination under partnership-level administrative and judicial procedures. Consequently, any remaining unsettled items, including any unsettled penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item, will be deemed to remain in dispute. Thus, the period for assessing any tax attributable to the settled items will be governed by the period for assessing any tax attributable to the remaining unsettled items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(1)-1  Exception for small partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of the exception for small partnerships under section 6231(a)(1)(B), the rules contained in this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 10 or fewer. The 10 or fewer limitation described in section 6231(a)(1)(B)(i) is applied to the number of natural persons, C corporations, and estates of deceased partners that were partners at any one time during the partnership taxable year. Thus, for example, a partnership that at no time during the taxable year had more than 10 partners may be treated as a small partnership even if, because of transfers of interests in the partnership, 11 or more natural persons, C corporations, or estates of deceased partners owned interests in the partnership for some portion of the taxable year.

The term ``partnership item'' includes the accounting practices and the legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit, gain, loss, deduction, etc. Examples of these determinations

are: The partnership's method of accounting, taxable year, and inventory method; whether an election was made by the partnership; whether partnership property is a capital asset, section 1231 property, or inventory; whether an item is currently deductible or must be capitalized; whether partnership activities have been engaged in with the intent to make a profit for purposes of section 183; and whether the partnership qualifies for the research and development credit under section 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustrations--(1) In general.

The critical element is that the partnership needs to make a determination with respect to a matter for the purposes stated; failure by the partnership actually to make a determination (for example, because it does not maintain proper books and records) does not prevent an item from being a partnership item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (c) illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The determinations illustrated in this paragraph (c) that the partnership is required to make are not exhaustive; there may be additional determinations that the partnership is required to make which relate to a transaction listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The critical element is that the partnership needs to make a determination with respect to a matter for the purposes stated; failure by the partnership actually to make a determination (for example, because it does not maintain proper books and records) does not prevent an item from being a partnership item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The character of the amount received from a partner (for example, whether it is a contribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of money contributed by a partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The applicability of the investment company rules of section 721(b) with respect to a contribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The basis to the partnership of contributed property (including necessary preliminary determinations, such as the partner's basis in the contributed property).
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a contribution can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. For example, it may be necessary to determine whether contribution of the property causes recapture by the contributing partner of the investment credit under section 47 in certain circumstances in which that determination is irrelevant to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions. For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The character of the amount transferred to a partner (for example, whether it is a distribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of money distributed to a partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The adjusted basis to the partnership of distributed property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The character of partnership property (for example, whether an item is inventory or a capital asset).
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a distribution can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. Such other information would include those factors used in determining the partner's basis for the partnership interest that are not themselves partnership items, such as the amount that the partner paid to acquire the partnership interest from a transferor partner if that transfer was not covered by an election under section 754.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transactions to which section 707 (a) applies. For purposes of its books and records, the partnership needs to determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount transferred from the partnership to a partner or from a partner to the partnership in any transaction to which section 707(a) applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The character of such an amount (for example, whether or not it is a loan; in the case of amounts paid over time for the purchase of an asset, what portion is interest); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of the capital interests and profits interests in the partnership owned by each partner.
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a transaction to

which section 707(a) applies can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. An example of such other information is the cost to the partner of goods sold to the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date.

The term affected item includes any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount provided by subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to the extent provided in this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount without floor. If a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that does not contain a floor (that is, a threshold amount of underpayment or understatement necessary before the imposition of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount) is imposed on a partner as the result of an adjustment to a partnership item, the term affected item shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the partnership item adjustment(s) to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount containing floor--(i) Floor exceeded prior to adjustment. If a partner would have been subject to a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor in the absence of an adjustment to a partnership item (that is, the partner's understatement or underpayment exceeded the floor even without an adjustment to a partnership item) the term affected item shall include only the portion of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the partnership item (or affected item) adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Floor exceeded prior to adjustment. If a partner would have been subject to a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor in the absence of an adjustment to a partnership item (that is, the partner's understatement or underpayment exceeded the floor even without an adjustment to a partnership item) the term affected item shall include only the portion of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the partnership item (or affected item) adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Floor not exceeded prior to adjustment. In the case of a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor, if the taxpayer's understatement or underpayment does not exceed the floor prior to an adjustment to a partnership item but does so after such adjustment, the term affected item shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the entire underpayment or understatement to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a partner of P, had an aggregate underpayment of $1,000 of which $100 is attributable to an adjustment to partnership items. A is negligent in reporting the partnership items. The accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for negligence computed

with reference to the $100 underpayment attributable to the partnership item adjustments is an affected item.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a partner of P, understated B's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $6,000. An adjustment to a partnership item resulting from a partnership proceeding increased B's income tax by an additional $2,000. Prior to the adjustment, B would have been subject to the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for a substantial understatement of income tax with respect to the $6,000 understatement attributable to nonpartnership items. The portion of the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the $2,000 understatement attributable to partnership items to which the accuracy-related penalty applies is an affected item. The portion of the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the $6,000 pre-existing understatement is not an affected item.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C, a partner in partnership P, understated C's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $4,000. As a result of an adjustment to partnership items, that understatement is increased to $10,000. Prior to the adjustment, C would not have been subject to the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for a substantial understatement of income tax. The accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the entire $10,000 understatement to which the accuracy-related penalty applies is an affected item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6231(a)(6)-1  Computational adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Changes in a partner's tax liability--(1) In general. A change in the tax liability of a partner to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code is made through a computational adjustment. A computational adjustment includes a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item, or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, if a change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made under the deficiency procedures (as described in subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code), except for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A change in the tax liability of a partner to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code is made through a computational adjustment. A computational adjustment includes a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item, or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, if a change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made under the deficiency procedures (as described in subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code), except for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affected items that do not require partner-level determinations. Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that do not require partner-level determinations (such as the threshold amount of medical deductions under section 213 that changes as the result of determinations made at the partnership level) are computational adjustments that are directly assessed. When making computational adjustments, the Internal Revenue Service may assume that amounts the partner reported on the partner's individual return include all amounts reported to the partner by the partnership (on the Schedule K-1s attached to the partnership's original return), absent contrary notice to the Internal Revenue Service (for example, a ``Notice of Inconsistent Treatment'' pursuant to Sec. 301.6222(a)-2(c)). Such an assumption by the Internal Revenue Service does not constitute a partner-level determination. Moreover, substituting redetermined partnership items for the partner's previously reported partnership items (including partnership items included in carryover amounts) does not constitute a partner-level determination where the Internal Revenue Service otherwise accepts, for the sole purpose of determining the computational adjustment, all nonpartnership items (including, for example, nonpartnership item components of carryover amounts) as reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Affected items that require partner-level determinations. Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that require partner-level determinations (such as a partner's at-risk amount to the extent it depends upon the source from which the partner obtained the funds that the partner contributed to the partnership) are computational adjustments that are

subject to the deficiency procedures. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item is not subject to the deficiency procedures, but rather may be directly assessed as part of the computational adjustment that is made following the partnership proceeding, based on determinations in that proceeding, regardless of whether any partner-level determinations may be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest. A computational adjustment includes any interest due with respect to any underpayment or overpayment of tax attributable to adjustments to reflect properly the treatment of partnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

A partnership may designate a partner as its tax matters partner for a specific taxable year only as provided in this section. Similarly, the designation of a partner as the tax matters partner for a specific taxable year may be terminated only as provided in this section. If a partnership does not designate a general partner as the tax matters partner for a specific taxable year, or if the designation is terminated without the partnership designating another general partner as the tax matters partner, the tax matters partner is the partner determined under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Person who may be designated tax matters partner--(1) General requirement.

The partnership may designate a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year on the partnership return for that taxable year in accordance with the instructions for that form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certification by current tax matters partner of selection of successor. If a partner properly designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership for a partnership taxable year under this section certifies that another partner has been selected as the tax matters partner of the partnership for that taxable year, that other partner is thereby designated as the tax matters partner for that year. The current tax matters partner shall make the certification by filing with the service center with which the partnership return is filed a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identifies the partnership, the partner filing the statement, and the successor tax matters partner by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specifies the partnership taxable year to which the designation relates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Declares that the partner filing the statement has been properly designated as the tax matters partner of the partnership for the partnership taxable year and that that designation is in effect immediately before the filing of the statement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certifies that the other named partner has been selected as the tax matters partner of the partnership for that taxable year in accordance with the partnership's procedure for making that selection; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Is signed by the partner filing the statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Designation by general partners with majority interest.

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), all limited partnership interests held by general partners shall be included in determining the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by such general partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Designation by partners with majority interest under certain circumstances--(1) In general. A tax matters partner may be designated for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (f) only if, at the time the designation is made, each partner who was a general partner at the close of such partnership taxable year is described in one or more of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A tax matters partner may be designated for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (f) only if, at the time the designation is made, each partner who was a general partner at the close of such partnership taxable year is described in one or more of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The general partner is dead, or, if the general partner is an entity, has been liquidated or dissolved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The general partner has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be no longer capable of managing his or her person or estate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The general partner's partnership items have become nonpartnership items under section 6231(b); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The general partner is no longer a partner in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of making designation.

The statement shall also be signed by the resigning tax matters partner and shall be filed

with the service center with which the partnership return was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Revocation of designation. The partnership may revoke the designation of the tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year at any time after the filing of a partnership return for that taxable year by filing a statement with the service center with which the partnership return was filed.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a designation, resignation, or revocation provided for in this section becomes effective on the day that the statement required by the applicable paragraph of this section is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a designation, resignation, or revocation provided for in this section becomes effective on the day that the statement required by the applicable paragraph of this section is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of proceeding mailed. If a notice of beginning of an administrative proceeding with respect to a partnership taxable year is mailed before the date on which a statement of designation, resignation, or revocation provided for in this section with respect to that taxable year is filed, the Service is not required to give effect to such designation, resignation, or revocation until 30 days after the statement is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Termination of designation--(1) In general. A designation of a tax matters partner for a taxable year under this section shall remain in effect until--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A designation of a tax matters partner for a taxable year under this section shall remain in effect until--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The death of the designated tax matters partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the individual designated as the tax matters partner is no longer capable of managing the individual's person or estate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The liquidation or dissolution of the tax matters partner, if the tax matters partner is an entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The partnership items of the tax matters partner become nonpartnership items under section 6231(c) (relating to special enforcement areas); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The day on which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The resignation of the tax matters partner under paragraph (i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A subsequent designation under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A revocation of the designation under paragraph (j) of this section becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actions by the tax matters partner before termination of designation. The termination of the designation of a partner as the tax matters partner under paragraph (l)(1) of this section does not affect the validity of any action taken by that partner as tax matters partner before the designation is terminated. For example, if that tax matters partner had previously consented to an extension of the period for assessments under section 6229(b)(1)(B), that extension remains valid even after termination of the designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Tax matters partner where no partnership designation made--(1) In general.

The tax matters partner for any partnership taxable year to which this paragraph (m) applies is the general partner having the largest profits interest in the partnership at the close of that taxable year (or where there is more than one such partner, the one of

such partners whose name would appear first in an alphabetical listing). For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), all limited partnership interests held by a general partner shall be included in determining that general partner's profits interest in the partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), the general partner with the largest profits interest is determined based on the year-end profits interests reported on the Schedules K-1 filed with the partnership income tax return for the taxable year for which the determination is being made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Termination of designation. A designation of a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (m) shall remain in effect until the earlier of the occurrence of one or more of the events described in paragraphs (l)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section or the day on which a designation under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section becomes effective. If a designation of a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year is terminated under this paragraph (m)(3) and the partnership has not subsequently designated a tax matters partner for that taxable year under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the tax matters partner for that taxable year shall be determined under paragraph (m)(2) of this section, and, for purposes of applying paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the general partner whose designation was so terminated shall be treated as having no profits interest in the partnership for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Selection of tax matters partner by Commissioner when impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule. If the partnership has not designated a tax matters partner under this section for the taxable year and it is impracticable (as determined under paragraph (o) of this section) to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will select a tax matters partner as described in paragraph (p) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Impracticability of largest-profits-interest rule.

The general partner with the largest profits interest is not apparent from the Schedules K-1 and is not otherwise readily determinable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each general partner is deemed to have no profits interest in the partnership. Each general partner is deemed to have no profits interest in the partnership under paragraph (m)(3) of this section (concerning termination of a designation under the largest-profits-interest rule) because of the occurrence of one or more of the events described in paragraphs (l)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section (involving death, adjudication of incompetency, liquidation, and conversion of partnership items to nonpartnership items).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> General partner with the largest profits interest is disqualified.

The profits interest held by B in P through T for P's taxable year ending June 30, 2002, is determined as of the moment before the sale on November 5, 2001.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C holds an interest in partnership P through T, a pass-thru partner. C, P, and T all use the calendar year as the taxable year. T disposes of T's interest in P on June 5, 2002. The profits interest held by C in P through T for 2002 is determined as of the moment before the disposition on June 5, 2002.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that C sold C's entire interest in T (and, therefore, C's entire interest that C held in P through T) on March 15, 2002. The profits interest held by C in P through T for 2002 is determined as of the moment before the sale on March 15, 2002.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On January 1, 2002, D held a 2 percent profits interest in partnership P. Both D and P use the calendar year as the taxable year. On August 1, 2002, D transfers three-fourths of D's profits interest in P to E. On September 1, 2002, D sells D's remaining .5 percent profits interest in P to F. For purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11), D had a .5 percent profits interest in P for 2002.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except that on January 1, 2002, D also held a 1 percent profits interest in partnership P through T, a pass-thru partner which also uses the calendar year as the taxable year. In addition to the sale to E on August 1, 2002, D sold a portion of D's interest in T on December 1, 2002, such that after the sale, D held a .2 percent profits interest in P through T. D made no other transfers of interests in either P or T. For purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11), D had a .7 percent profits interest in P for 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6231(d)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6231(e)-1  Effect of a determination with respect to anonpartnership item on the determination of a partnership item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The determination of an item after it has become a nonpartnership item with respect to a partner is not controlling in the determination of that item with respect to other partners. Thus, for example, the determination by a court in a separate proceeding relating to a partner that a certain partnership expenditure was deductible does not bind either the Internal Revenue Service or the other partners in a later partnership or other proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6231(e)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6231(e)-2  Judicial decision not a bar to certain adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A court decision with respect to a partner's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items shall not be a bar to further proceedings with respect to that partner's income tax liability if that partner's partnership items become nonpartnership items after the appropriate time to include such nonpartnership items in the earlier court proceeding has passed. Thus, the Internal Revenue Service could issue a later deficiency notice for the same taxable year with respect to that partner or that partner could bring a refund suit with respect to those items that have become nonpartnership items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6231(e)-2T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

Sec. 301.6231(f)-1  Disallowance of losses and credits in certain cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application of section. This section applies if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A partnership, whether domestic or foreign, that is required to file a return under section 6031 for a taxable year fails to file the return within the time prescribed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At any time after the close of that taxable year, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tax matters partner of that partnership resides outside the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The books and records of that partnership are maintained outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computational adjustment permitted if return is not filed after mailing of notice. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section applies with respect to a partnership for a partnership taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Internal Revenue Service mails notice to a partner that the losses and credits arising from that partnership for that year will be disallowed to that partner unless the partnership files a return for that year within 60 days after the date on which the notice is mailed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The partnership fails to file a return for that year within that 60-day period, the Internal Revenue Service may, without conducting a partnership-level proceeding, mail a notice of computational adjustment to that partner to reflect the disallowance of any loss (including a capital loss) or credit arising from that partnership for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Restriction on notices under paragraph (b) of this section. Neither the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section nor the notice of computational adjustment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section may be mailed on a day on which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tax matters partner of the partnership resides within the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The books and records of the partnership are maintained within the United States. Thus, if this section applies with respect to a partnership for a taxable year solely because the tax matters partner of that partnership resided outside the United States for a period after the close of that taxable year and the tax matters partner later takes up residence within the United States, no notice may be mailed under paragraph (b) of this section while the

tax matters partner resides within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> No disallowance in certain circumstances. If the person to whom the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is mailed establishes to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That the losses and credits arising from the partnership for the year are proper; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the partner has made a good faith effort to have the partnership file the required return; the Internal Revenue Service may allow the losses and credits in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see Sec. 301.6231(f)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
