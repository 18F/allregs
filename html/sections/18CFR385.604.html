                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participants may, subject to the limitations  of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, use alternative means of dispute  resolution to resolve all or part of any pending matter if the  participants agree. The alternative means of dispute resolution  authorized under subpart F of this part will be voluntary procedures  that supplement rather than limit other available dispute resolution  techniques.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the  decisional authority will not consent to use of an alternative dispute  resolution proceeding if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is  required for precedential value;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of  policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may  be made, and the proceeding would not likely serve to develop a  recommended policy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintaining established policies is of special importance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The matter significantly affects persons or organizations who  are not parties to the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A full public record of the proceeding is important, and a  dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide a record; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Commission must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the  matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the  light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding  would interfere with the Commission's fulfilling that requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If one or more of the factors outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section is present, alternative dispute resolution may nevertheless  be used if the alternative dispute resolution proceeding can be  structured to avoid the identified factor or if other concerns  significantly outweigh the identified factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A determination to use or not to use a dispute resolution  proceeding under subpart F of this part is not subject to judicial  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Settlement agreements reached through the use of alternative  dispute resolution pursuant to subpart F of this part will be subject to  the provisions of Rule 602, unless the decisional authority, upon motion  or otherwise, orders a different procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of subpart F of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alternative means of dispute resolution means any procedure that  is used, in lieu of an adjudication, to resolve issues in controversy,  including but not limited to, settlement negotiations, conciliation,  facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials, and arbitration, or  any combination thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Award means any decision by an arbitrator resolving the issues  in controversy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dispute resolution communication means any oral or written  communication prepared for the purposes of a dispute resolution  proceeding, including any memoranda, notes or work product of the  neutral, parties or non-party participant. A written agreement to enter  into a dispute resolution proceeding, or a final written agreement or  arbitral award reached as a result of a dispute resolution proceeding,  is not a dispute resolution communication;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dispute resolution proceeding means any alternative means of  dispute resolution that is used to resolve an issue in controversy in  which a neutral may be appointed and specified parties participate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In confidence means information is provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With the expressed intent of the source that it not be  disclosed, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under circumstances that create a reasonable expectation on  behalf of the source that the information will not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Issue in controversy means an issue which is or is anticipated  to be material to a decision in a proceeding before the Commission and  which is the subject of disagreement between participants who would be  substantially affected by the decision or between the Commission and any  such participants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Neutral means an individual who, with respect to an issue in  controversy, functions specifically to aid the parties in resolving the  controversy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Participants in a dispute resolution proceeding that is used to  resolve an issue in controversy in a proceeding involving an application  for a license or exemption to construct, operate, and maintain a  hydroelectric project pursuant to the Federal Power Act or the Public  Utility Regulatory Policies Act shall include such state and federal  agencies and Indian tribes as have statutory roles or a direct interest  in such hydroelectric proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neutrals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A neutral may be a permanent or temporary officer  or employee of the Federal Government (including an administrative law  judge), or any other individual who is acceptable to the participants to  a dispute resolution proceeding. A neutral must have no official,  financial, or personal conflict of interest with respect to the issues  in controversy, except that a neutral who is not a government employee  may serve if the interest is fully disclosed in writing to all  participants and all participants agree.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A neutral serves at the will of the participants, unless  otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Neutrals may be selected from among the Commission's  administrative law judges or other employees, from rosters kept by the  Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Administrative  Conference of the United States, the American Arbitration Association,  or from any other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission of proposal to use alternative means of dispute  resolution. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participants may at any time submit a written  proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution to resolve all  or part of any matter in controversy or anticipated to be in controversy  before the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For matters set for hearing under subpart E of this part, a  proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution must be filed  with the presiding administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all other matters, a proposal to use alternative means of  dispute resolution may be filed with the Secretary for consideration by  the appropriate decisional authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The appropriate decisional authority will issue an order,  approving or denying, under the guidelines in Rule 604(a) (2) and (3), a  proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution. Denial of a  proposal to use alternative dispute resolution will be in the form of an  order and will identify the specific reasons for the denial. A proposal  to use alternative dispute resolution is deemed approved unless an order  denying approval is issued within 30 days after the proposal is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any request to modify a previously-approved ADR proposal must  follow the same procedure used for the initial approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contents of proposal. A proposal to use alternative means of  dispute resolution must be in writing and include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A general identification of the issues in controversy intended  to be resolved by the proposed alternative dispute resolution method,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the alternative dispute resolution method(s) to  be used,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The signatures of all participants or evidence otherwise  indicating the consent of all participants; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A certificate of service pursuant to Rule 2010(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Monitoring the alternative dispute resolution proceeding. The  decisional authority may order reports on the status of the alternative  dispute resolution proceeding at any time.
