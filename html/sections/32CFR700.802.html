Of particular importance is the commanding officer's duty to take all necessary and appropriate action in self-defense of the command.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The commanding officer shall be responsible for economy within his or her command. To this end the commanding officer shall require from his or her subordinates a rigid compliance with the regulations governing the receipt, accounting, and expenditure of public money and materials, and the implementation of improved management techniques and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The commanding officer and his or her subordinates shall exercise leadership through personal example, moral responsibility, and judicious attention to the welfare of persons under their control or supervision.
