                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The material of construction of a tank and its  appurtenances must be inspected for conformance to Section VIII of the  ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank must be  subjected to either a hydrostatic or pneumatic test. The test pressure  must be one and one-half times the sum of the design pressure, plus  static head of lading, plus 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) if subjected to  external vacuum, except that for tanks constructed in accordance with  Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code the test pressure must be  twice the design pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional requirements for pneumatic test. A pneumatic test may  be used in place of the hydrostatic test. Due regard for protection of  all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved  in a pneumatic test. The pneumatic test pressure in the tank must be  reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test  pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of  approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test  pressure has been reached. Then the pressure must be reduced to a value  equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time  to permit inspection of the cargo tank for leaks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Weld inspection. All tank shell or head welds subject to  pressure shall be radiographed in accordance with Section VIII of the  ASME Code. A tank which has been subjected to inspection by the magnetic  particle method, the liquid penetrant method, or any method involving a  material deposit on the interior tank surface, must be cleaned to remove  any such residue by scrubbing or equally effective means, and all such  residue and cleaning solution must be removed from the tank prior to  final closure of the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Defect repair. All cracks and other defects must be repaired as  prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code. The welder and the welding  procedure must be qualified in accordance with Section   IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). After  repair, the tank must again be postweld heat-treated, if such heat  treatment was previously performed, and the repaired areas must be  retested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Verification must be made of the interior cleanliness of a tank  constructed for oxygen service by means that assure that all  contaminants that are likely to react with the lading have been removed  as required by Sec. 178.338-15.
