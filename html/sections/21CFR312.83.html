                            <p class="depth0">If the preliminary analysis of phase 2 test results appears  promising, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit a treatment protocol to be  reviewed under the procedures and criteria listed in Sec. Sec. 312.305  and 312.320. Such a treatment protocol, if requested and granted, would  normally remain in effect while the complete data necessary for a  marketing application are being assembled by the sponsor and reviewed by  FDA (unless grounds exist for clinical hold of ongoing protocols, as  provided in Sec. 312.42(b)(3)(ii)).
