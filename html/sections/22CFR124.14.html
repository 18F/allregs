                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreements. Agreements (e.g., contracts) between U.S. persons and foreign persons for the warehousing and distribution of defense articles must be approved by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls before they enter into force. Such agreements will be limited to unclassified defense articles and must contain conditions for special distribution, end-use and reporting. Licenses for exports pursuant to such agreements must be obtained prior to exports of the defense articles unless an exemption under Sec. 123.16(b)(1) of this subchapter is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required information. Proposed warehousing and distribution agreements (and amendments thereto) shall be submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for approval. The following information must be included in all such agreements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the defense articles involved including test and support equipment covered by the U.S. Munitions List. This shall include when applicable the military nomenclature, the Federal stock number, nameplate data, and any control numbers under which the defense articles were developed or procured by the U.S. Government. Only those defense articles specifically listed in the agreement will be eligible for export under the exemption in Sec. 123.16(b)(1) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed statement of the terms and conditions under which the defense

articles will be exported and distributed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The duration of the proposed agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specific identification of the country or countries that comprise the distribution territory. Distribution must be specifically limited to the governments of such countries or to private entities seeking to procure defense articles pursuant to a contract with a government within the distribution territory or to other eligible entities as specified by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Consequently, any deviation from this condition must be fully explained and justified. A nontransfer and use certificate (DSP-83) will be required to the same extent required in licensing agreements under Sec. 124.9(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required statements. The following statements must be included in all warehousing and distribution agreements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``This agreement shall not enter into force, and may not be amended or extended, without the prior written approval of the Department of State of U.S. Government.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``This agreement is subject to all United States laws and regulations related to exports and to all administrative acts of the United States Government pursuant to such laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``The parties to this agreement agree that the obligations contained in this agreement shall not affect the performance of any obligations created by prior contracts or subcontracts which the parties may have individually or collectively with the U.S. Government.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``No liability will be incurred by or attributed to the U.S. Government in connection with any possible infringement of privately owned patent or proprietary rights, either domestic or foreign by reason of the U.S. Government's approval of this agreement.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``No export, sale, transfer, or other disposition of the defense articles covered by this agreement is authorized to any country outside the distribution territory without the prior written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ``The parties to this agreement agree that an annual report of sales or other transfers pursuant to this agreement of the licensed articles, by quantity, type, U.S. dollar value, and purchaser or recipient shall be provided by (applicant or licensee) to the Department of State.'' This clause must specify which party is obligated to provide the annual report. Such reports may be submitted either directly by the licensee or indirectly through the licensor, and may cover calendar or fiscal years. Reports shall be deemed proprietary information by the Department of State and will not be disclosed to unauthorized persons. (See Sec. 126.10(b) of this subchapter.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> (Licensee) agrees to incorporate the following statement as an integral provision of a contract, invoice or other appropriate document whenever the articles covered by this agreement are sold or otherwise transferred:</p><p class="depth3">These commodities are authorized for export by the U.S. Government only to (country of ultimate destination or approved sales territory). They may not be resold, diverted, transferred, transshipped, or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their original form or after being incorporated through an intermediate process into other end-items, without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ``All provisions in this agreement which refer to the United States Government and the Department of State will remain binding on the parties after the termination of the agreement.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Additional clause. Unless the articles covered by the agreement are in fact intended to be distributed to private persons or entities (e.g., sporting firearms for commercial resale, cryptographic devices and software for financial and business applications), the following clause must be included in all warehousing and distribution agreements: ``Sales or other transfers of the licensed article shall be limited to governments of the countries in the distribution territory and to private entities seeking to procure the licensed article pursuant to a contract with a government within the distribution territory, unless the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State is obtained.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special clauses for agreements relating to significant military equipment. With respect to agreements for the warehousing and distribution of significant military equipment, the following additional provisions must be included in the agreement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A completed nontransfer and use certificate (DSP-83) must be executed by the foreign end-user and submitted to the U.S. Department of State before any transfer may take place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State must be obtained before entering into a commitment for the transfer of the licensed article by sale or otherwise to any person or government outside the approved distribution territory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transmittal letters. Requests for approval of warehousing and distribution agreements with foreign persons must be made by letter. The original letter and seven copies of the letter and seven copies of the proposed agreement shall be submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The letter shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement giving the applicant's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls registration number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement identifying the foreign party to the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement identifying the defense articles to be distributed under the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement identifying any U.S. Government contract under which the equipment may have been generated, improved, developed or supplied to the U.S. Government, and whether the equipment was derived from any bid or other proposal to the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement that no classified defense articles or classified technical data are involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement identifying any patent application which discloses any of the subject matter of the equipment or related technical data covered by an invention secrecy order issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Required clauses. The following statements must be made in the letter of transmittal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``If the agreement is approved by the Department of State, such approval will not be construed by (applicant) as passing on the legality of the agreement from the standpoint of antitrust laws or other applicable statutes, nor will (the applicant) construe the Department's approval as constituting either approval or disapproval of any of the business terms or conditions between the parties to the agreement.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``The (applicant) will not permit the proposed agreement to enter into force until it has been approved by the Department of State.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``(Applicant) will furnish the Department of State with one copy of the signed agreement (or amendment thereto) within 30 days from the date that the agreement is concluded, and will inform the Department of its termination not less than 30 days prior to expiration. If a decision is made not to conclude the proposed agreement, (applicant) will so inform the Department within 60 days.''
