                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Appropriate valves. Those valves in a particular piping system, i.e., fill lines, equalizer or overflow lines, sales lines, circulating lines, and drain lines that shall be sealed during a given operation.</p><p class="depth2">Effectively sealed. The placement of a seal in such a manner that the position of the sealed valve may not be altered without the seal being destroyed.</p><p class="depth2">Production phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is delivered directly to or through production vessels to the storage facilities and includes all operations at the facility other than those defined by the sales phase.</p><p class="depth2">Sales phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is removed from the storage facilities for sales, transportation or other purposes.</p><p class="depth2">Seal. A device, uniquely numbered, which completely secures a valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum Standards. Each operator of a Federal or Indian lease shall comply with the following minimum standards to assist in providing accountability of oil or gas production:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All lines entering or leaving oil storage tanks shall have valves capable of being effectively sealed during the production and sales operations unless otherwise modified by other subparagraphs of this paragraph, and any equipment needed for effective sealing, excluding the seals, shall be located at the site. For a minimum of 6 years the operator shall maintain a record of seal numbers used and shall document on which valves or connections they were used as well as when they were installed and removed. The site facility diagram(s) shall show which valves will be sealed in which position during both the production and sales phases of operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) system shall employ meters that have non-resettable totalizers. There shall be no by-pass piping around the LACT. All components of the LACT that are used for volume or quality determinations of the oil shall be effectively sealed. For systems where production may only be removed through the LACT, no sales or equalizer valves need be sealed. However, any valves which may allow access for removal of oil before measurement through the LACT shall be effectively sealed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There shall be no by-pass piping around gas meters. Equipment which permits changing the orifice plate without bleeding the pressure off the gas meter run is not considered a by-pass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For oil measured and sold by hand gauging, all appropriate valves shall be sealed during the production or sales phase, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Circulating lines having valves which may allow access to remove oil from storage and sales facilities to any other source except through the treating equipment back to storage shall be effectively sealed as near the storage tank as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The operator, with reasonable frequency, shall inspect all leases to determine production volumes and that the minimum site security standards are being met. The operator shall retain records of such inspections and measurements for 6 years from generation. Such records and measurements shall be available to any authorized officer or authorized representative upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any person removing oil from a facility by motor vehicle shall possess the identification documentation required by appicable NTL's or onshore Orders while the oil is removed and transported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Theft or mishandling of oil from a Federal or Indian lease shall be reported to the authorized officer as soon as discovered, but not later than the next business day. Said report shall include an estimate of the volume of oil involved. Operators also are expected to report such thefts promptly to local law enforcement agencies and internal company security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any operator may request the authorized officer to approve a variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed by this section. The variance request shall be submitted in writing to the authorized officer who may consider such factors as regional oil field facility characteristics and fenced, guarded sites. The authorized officer may approve a variance if the proposed alternative will ensure measures equal to or in excess of the minimum standards provided in paragraph (b) of this section will be put in place to detect or prevent internal and external theft, and will result in proper production accountability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Site security plans. (1) Site security plans, which include the operator's plan for complying with the minimum standards enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section for ensuring accountability of oil/condensate production are required for all facilities and such facilities shall be maintained in compliance with the plan. For new facilities, notice shall be given that it is subject to a specific existing plan, or a notice of a new plan shall be submitted, no later than 60 days after completion of construction or first production or following the inclusion of a well on committed non-Federal lands into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement, whichever occurs first, and on that date the

facilities shall be in compliance with the plan. At the operator's option, a single plan may include all of the operator's leases, unit and communitized areas, within a single BLM district, provided the plan clearly identifies each lease, unit, or communitized area included within the scope of the plan and the extent to which the plan is applicable to each lease, unit, or communitized area so identified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Site security plans, which include the operator's plan for complying with the minimum standards enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section for ensuring accountability of oil/condensate production are required for all facilities and such facilities shall be maintained in compliance with the plan.

Such notification is due at the time the plan is completed as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Such notification shall include the location and normal business hours of the office where the plan will be maintained. Upon request, all plans shall be made available to the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan shall include the frequency and method of the operator's inspection and production volume recordation. The authorized officer may, upon examination, require adjustment of the method or frequency of inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Site facility diagrams. (1) Facility diagrams are required for all facilities which are used in storing oil/condensate produced from, or allocated to, Federal or Indian lands. Facility diagrams shall be filed within 60 days after new measurement facilities are installed or existing facilities are modified or following the inclusion of the facility into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facility diagrams are required for all facilities which are used in storing oil/condensate produced from, or allocated to, Federal or Indian lands. Facility diagrams shall be filed within 60 days after new measurement facilities are installed or existing facilities are modified or following the inclusion of the facility into a federally supervised unit or communitization agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No format is prescribed for facility diagrams. They are to be prepared on 8\1/2\ x 11 paper, if possible, and be legible and comprehensible to a person with ordinary working knowledge of oil field operations and equipment. The diagram need not be drawn to scale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A site facility diagram shall accurately reflect the actual conditions at the site and shall, commencing with the header if applicable, clearly identify the vessels, piping, metering system, and pits, if any, which apply to the handling and disposal of oil, gas and water. The diagram shall indicate which valves shall be sealed and in what position during the production or sales phase. The diagram shall clearly identify the lease on which the facility is located and the site security plan to which it is subject, along with the location of the plan.
