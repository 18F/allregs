This site also contains information on accessing records under the FOIA and the Privacy Act. The site is a valuable source that is easily accessed by the public by clicking on ``FOIA'' at the Department's Web site at http://www.state.gov or directly at the FOIA home page at http://foia.state.gov. Included on the FOIA home page are links to other sites where Department information may be available.
