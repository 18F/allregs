                            <p class="depth0">The collections of information contained in Sec. Sec. 705.11 and  705.17 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under  44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1029-0067. The  information is being collected on OSM Form 23 and will be used to meet  the requirements of section 517(g) of the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act of 1977, which provides that no employee of the State  regulatory authority shall have direct or indirect financial interests  in any underground or surface coal mining operation. This information  will be used by officials of the state regulatory authority to determine  whether each State employee complies with the financial interest  provisions of section 517(g). The obligation to respond is mandatory in  accordance with section 517(g). Public reporting burden for this  information is estimated to average 20 minutes per response per state  employee and 30 minutes per response per State regulatory authority,  including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data  sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and  reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this  burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,  including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information  Collection Clearance Officer, Office of Surface Mining, 1951  Constitution Avenue NW., room 5415-L, Washington, DC 20240; and the  Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1029-0067,  Washington, DC 20503.
