                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. In accordance with a Determination and Findings issued  by the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, the requirement  for advance notices in the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) for the  Department's foreign acquisitions awarded by overseas contracting  activities is waived. GPE notices may be published for any acquisition  where the contracting officer decides that publication would be in the  Department's best interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. Contracting officers at overseas contracting  activities are not required to prepare an individual determination and  findings to document their decision to waive the GPE notice  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Competition requirements. Nothing in this section waives the  requirement to obtain competition as required by FAR part 6 and DOSAR  (48 CFR) part 606. Competition, including the use of written  solicitation, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible. If  there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local  residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the  contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the  source list for the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Policy exclusions. GPE waiver authority does not apply to local  guard service contracts exceeding $250,000, or any contracts exceeding  $5 million. Local guard service contracts that exceed $250,000 and other  contracts that exceed $5 million shall be published in the GPE. Option  year prices shall be included when computing the applicability of this  threshold.  [60 FR 39662, Aug. 3, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 43621, Aug. 11, 1999; 69  FR 19331, Apr. 13, 2004]</p>
