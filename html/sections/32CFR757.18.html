                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial action by the JAG designee. When advised of a potential  claim, the JAG designee will determine the Federal agency or department  responsible for investigating and asserting the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When DoN has reimbursed a non-Federal provider for health care,  or when TRICARE has made payment for a Navy health care beneficiary, the  JAG designee will assert any resulting claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When care is provided in a Federal treatment facility, the  status of the injured person will determine the agency that will assert  a resulting claim. Cost of treatment provided or paid for by an MTF is  deposited in that MTF's account, regardless of which service is making  the collection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where DoN members, retirees, or their dependents receive medical  treatment from another Federal agency or department, the DoN will assert  any claim on behalf of the United States based on information provided  by the treating agency or department.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Similarly, where a DoN MTF provides care to personnel of  another Federal agency or department, that other agency or department  will assert any claim on behalf of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the claim is one which the DoN should assert, the JAG  designee will forward all available information to the appropriate  department or agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the claim is one which the DoN should assert, the JAG  designee will ensure an appropriate investigation into the circumstances  underlying the claim is initiated and will provide notice to the injured  party and all third parties who may be liable to the injured person and  the United States under the MCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigating the claim. While there is no prescribed form or  content for investigating these claims, the claims file will contain  sufficient information on which to base valuation, assertion,  settlement, waiver, and/or compromise decisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of claim. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The JAG designee will assert claims by  mailing a notice of claim to identified third-party tortfeasors and  their insurers or insurers for third-party beneficiary coverage. Many  insured tortfeasors fail   to notify their insurance companies of incidents. This failure may be a  breach of the cooperation clause in the policy and may be grounds for  the insurer to refuse to defend the insured or be responsible for any  liability. The United States, as a claimant, may preclude such an  invocation by giving the requisite notification itself. The purpose of  the insurance clause is satisfied if the insurer receives actual notice  of the incident, regardless of the informant. This notice should be  mailed as soon as it appears an identified third party may be liable for  the injuries. The prompt assertion of the claim will ensure that the  government is named on the settlement draft. If the United States is not  so named, and the claim has been asserted, the insurer settles at its  own risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The JAG designee will also notify the injured person or his  legal representative of the Government's interest in the value of the  medical care provided by the United States. This notice will advise  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The United States may be entitled to recover the reasonable  value of medical care furnished or paid by the Federal government;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The injured person is required to cooperate in the efforts of  the United States to recover the reasonable value of medical care  furnished or paid for by the Federal government;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administering the claim. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After investigating and asserting  the claim, the JAG designee will maintain contact with all parties,  their legal representatives, and insurers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An effort should be made to coordinate collection of the Federal  government's interest with the injured person's action to collect on a  claim for damages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Attorneys representing an injured person may be authorized to  include the Federal government's claim as an item of special damages  with the injured person's claim or suit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An agreement that the Government's claim will be made a party  of the injured person's action should be in writing and state the  counsel fees will not be paid by the Government or computed on the basis  of the Government's portion of recovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the injured person is not bringing an action for damages or  is refusing to include the Federal Government's interest, the JAG  designee will pursue independent collection. The United States is  specifically allowed to intervene or join in any action at law brought  by or through the injured person against the liable third person or  brings an original suit in its own name or in the name of the injured  person. The JAG designee will ensure all parties are aware that the  United States must be a party to all subsequent collection negotiation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Government's interests are not being represented by the  injured person or his/her attorney, and independent collection efforts  have failed, the JAG designee will refer the claims to the DoJ for  possible suit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to DoN records and information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies of medical  records in cases that have potential claims will be sent by the MTFs to  the cognizant JAG designee. It is considered a routine use of the  records for the JAG designee to release them to an insurance company, if  requested, in order to substantiate the claim. However, only the MTF as  ``keepers of the records'' has the authority to make official releases  of medical records to anyone else. Records will be protected in  accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and  confidentiality of quality assurance medical records, 10 U.S.C. 1102.  Non-routine release requires the authorization from the injured  individual or legal representative or an order from a court of competent  jurisdiction. A clerk or attorney signed subpoena is not ``an order from  a court of competent jurisdiction.'' Subpoenas are processed in  accordance with 32 CFR part 725.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for testimony of any Navy employees will be processed  in accordance with DoD Directive 5405.2, 32 CFR part 725, and SECNAVINST  5820.8A. If the injured person, or his or her attorney has signed an  agreement to protect the Government's interest and is requesting the  testimony of a locally available physician who treated the injured  person, however, this request falls within an exception to the  regulations. See 32 CFR 725.5(g)(3). In this situation, the injured  person or   the attorney need only ask the JAG designee for assistance in scheduling  the testimony of the treating physician and the JAG designee will  coordinate with the physician's command to determine availability. Such  testimony is limited to factual issues. The definition of factual issues  is slightly different under the regulations than it is in civil  litigation. Opinions that are formed prior to, or contemporaneously  with, the treatment at issue and are routinely required in the course of  the proper performance of professional duties constitute essentially  factual matters. For example, the physician will have opined at the time  of treatment if further treatment will be necessary. The physician may  testify to that as factual, not opinion, testimony. Opinions that are  formed after treatment and are not required for continuing treatment,  especially those that respond to hypothetical questions, are not factual  and are considered to be expert testimony. This expert testimony,  regardless of who requests it, will be processed in accordance with 32  CFR part 725, and must be forwarded to OJAG Code 14, General Litigation  Division. Requests for expert testimony are rarely granted.  [72 FR 53429, Sept. 19, 2007]</p>
