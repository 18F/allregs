                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractor A has a deferred compensation plan in which all cash  awards are increased each year by an interest factor equivalent to the  long-term borrowing rate of the contractor prevailing during each such  year. The interest factor based on a variable long-term borrowing rate  meets the criteria of 9904.415-50(d)(2). Consequently, the cost of  deferred compensation for Contractor A shall be measured by the present  value of the future benefits and shall be assigned to the cost  accounting period in which the contractor initially incurs an obligation  to compensate the employee. If the long-term borrowing rate for  Contractor A was 9 percent at the close of the period to which the cost  of deferred compensation was assignable, then that rate should be used  to calculate the future benefit. Any adjustment in the cost of deferred  compensation which results from a material change in the 9 percent rate  in future applicable periods shall be made in each such future period or  periods (see 9904.415-50(d)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractor B made a deferred compensation award of $10,000 to an  employee on December 31, 1976, for services performed in 1976 to be paid  in equal annual payments of $2,000 starting at December 31, 1981. The  terms of the award do not provide for an interest factor to be included  in the payment; consequently, according to provisions of 9904.415- 50(d)(1), interest may not be included in the computation of the future  benefits. The assignable cost for 1976 is computed as follows, assuming  that the interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury  (pursuant to Public Law 92-41), 85 Stat. 97 at the time of the award is  8 percent and the conditions set forth in 9904.415-50(a) are met.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Amount of future paymentxdiscount</p><p class="depth2">Year                     rate 8-percent present value</p><p class="depth2">factor=present value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1981................................  $2,000x0.6805=$1,361 1982................................  2,000x.6301=1,260 1983................................  2,000x.5834=1,167 1984................................  2,000x.5402=1,080 1985................................  2,000x.5002=1,000</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Assignable cost for 1976........  5,868 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor C awarded stock options for 1,000 shares of the  contractor to key employees on December 31, 1976, under a deferred  compensation plan requiring 2 years of additional service before the  awards can be exercised. The facts and circumstances of the awards  indicate that the deferred compensation applies only to the periods of  future service. The market price of the stock was $26 per share, the  option price was $22, and the interest rate established by the Secretary  of the Treasury in effect at the time of award was 8 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with 9904.415-50(e)(2), the cost of the stock  options is the amount by which the current value of the stock exceeds  the option price multiplied by the number of shares awarded on the  measurement date. Thus, the total cost of the stock options is 1,000  shares multiplied by the difference of the option price and the market  price ($26-22) or $4,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under provisions of 9904.415-50(e)(3), the cost for stock  options is assigned to each future cost accounting period in which  employee service is required and is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Assignable</p><p class="depth3">cost \1\</p><p class="depth3">Year of required service:</p><p class="depth3">1977.....................................................       $2,000</p><p class="depth3">1978.....................................................        2,000</p><p class="depth3">------------</p><p class="depth3">Total amount of award..................................        4,000</p><p class="depth3">\1\ Note that this illustration assumes that the facts and circumstances</p><p class="depth3">of the award indicate that the award relates equally to each period of</p><p class="depth3">future service. Thus, the assignable cost was allocated on a pro-rata</p><p class="depth3">basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contractor D has a deferred compensation plan that specifies  that an employee receiving a cash award must remain with the company for  3 calendar years after the award in order to qualify and receive the  award and the facts and circumstances indicate that the deferred  compensation applies only to the periods of future service. In  accordance with 9904.415-50(d)(4), the cost of deferred compensation is  assignable to the periods of future service. Thus, the amount of cost of  deferred compensation to be assigned by Contractor D for each of the 3  years shall be the present value of the future benefits of the deferred  compensation award calculated as of the end of each such period to which  such cost is assigned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under this plan, Contractor D made an award to an employee of  $3,000 to be paid at the end of the third year.

Contractor E made an award of $6,000 at the end of 1976 to an  employee to be paid at the end of 1978. However, the employee  voluntarily terminated his employment before the end of 1977. The facts  and circumstances of the award indicate that $2,000 of the award  represents compensation for services rendered in the period of award  (1976). The remaining portion of the award represents compensation for  services to be rendered in future periods. The assignable cost for 1976,  which was the only period to which costs were assigned before  termination, was the present value of $2,000, the amount of the award  attributable to the services of that period. Thus, the cost assigned for  1976 was:  Amount of future paymentxDiscount rate present value factor for 2 yr at  8 pct=Assignable cost  $2,000x0.8573=$1,714.60</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> According to provisions of 9904.415-50(d)(7), the amount of the  forfeiture shall be the amount of the cost that was assigned to a prior  period, plus interest compounded annually, from the year the cost was  assigned to the year of forfeiture, using the same Treasury rate (see  9904.415-50(d)(5)) that was used as the discount rate at the time the  cost was assigned. The IRS rate in effect at the date of award was 8  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the forfeiture is computed as follows:  Assignable costxDiscount rate future value for 1 yr at 8 pct=Forfeiture $1,714.60x1.08=$1,851.77</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contractor F has a non-leveraged ESOP. Under the contractor's  plan, employees are awarded 5,000 shares of stock for the year ended  December 31, 2007. On February 5, 2008, when the shares have a market  value of $10.00   each, the 5,000 shares are contributed to the ESOP and allocated to the  individual employee accounts. The total measured and assigned deferred  compensation cost for FY 2007 is $50,000 (5,000x$10=$50,000). The market  value of the contractor's stock when awarded to the employees, whether  higher or lower than the $10.00 per share market value when the  contractor's contribution was made to the ESOP, is irrelevant to the  measurement of the contractor's ESOP costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contractor G has a leveraged ESOP. Under the contractor's plan,  employees are awarded 10,000 shares of stock for the year ended December  31, 2007. On February 15, 2008, the contractor contributes $780,000 in  cash to the ESOP trust (ESOT) to satisfy the principal and interest  payment on the ESOT loan for FY 2007, resulting in the bank releasing  9,000 shares of stock, and 1,000 shares of stock valued at $60,000 to  the ESOT, representing the balance of the 10,000 shares. On February 22,  2008, the ESOP allocates 10,000 shares to the individual employee  accounts. The total measured and assigned deferred compensation cost for  FY 2007 is $840,000--the contractor's total contribution required to  satisfy the deferred compensation obligation totaling 10,000 shares.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contractor H has a leveraged ESOP. Under the contractor's  plan, employees are awarded 8,000 shares of stock for the year ended  December 31, 2007. On January 31, 2008, the contractor contributes  $500,000 in cash to the ESOT to satisfy the principal and interest  payment on the ESOT loan for 2007, resulting in the bank releasing  10,000 shares of stock. On February 10, 2008, 8,000 shares are allocated  to individual employee accounts, satisfying the deferred compensation  obligation for 2007. The total measured deferred compensation cost for  2007 is $500,000--the contractor's contribution for the cost accounting  period. However, the total assignable deferred compensation cost for  2007 is $400,000--the portion of the contribution that satisfies the  2007 deferred compensation obligation of 8,000 shares [(8,000 shares /  10,000 shares) x $500,000 = $400,000]. The remaining $100,000 of the  contribution made in 2007 is assignable to future periods in which the  remaining 2,000 shares of stock are awarded to employees and allocated  to individual employee accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At December 31, 2008, the employees are awarded 12,000 shares of  stock. On January 31, 2009, Contractor H contributes $500,000 in cash to  the ESOT to satisfy the principal and interest payment on the ESOT loan  for 2008, resulting in the bank releasing 10,000 shares of stock. On  February 10, 2009, 12,000 shares are allocated to individual employee  accounts satisfying the deferred compensation obligation for 2008. The  total deferred compensation assignable to 2008 is $600,000, the cost of  the 12,000 shares awarded to employees and allocated to individual  employee accounts for 2008. The cost of the award is comprised of the  contractor's contribution for the current cost accounting period (10,000  shares at $500,000) and the 2007 contribution carryover (2,000 shares at  $100,000).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contractor I has a leveraged ESOP. Under the contractor's plan,  employees are awarded 10,000 shares for FY 2007, which ended December  31, 2007. On February 10, 2008, Contractor I contributes $700,000 in  cash to satisfy the principal and interest payment for the ESOP loan for  FY 2007. This contribution results in the bank releasing 10,000 shares  of stock. On March 1, 2008, the ESOP allocates the 10,000 shares to  individual employee accounts satisfying the 2007 obligation. The 10,000  shares of stock must be assigned to FY 2007 (these shares cannot be  assigned to 2008).  [57 FR 14153, Apr. 17, 1992, as amended at 73 FR 23965, May 1, 2008]</p>
