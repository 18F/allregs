Grantees must use the request for advance or reimbursement form, which will be provided by CCC, to request advances or reimbursements;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeals.

CCC prohibits discrimination in all its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, and where applicable, sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion, sexual orientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or because all or a part of an individual's income is derived from any public assistance program.

CCC may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this part, provided that any such exception is not inconsistent with any applicable law or opinion of the Comptroller General, and provided further, that CCC determines that the application of the requirement or provision would adversely affect the Federal Government's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Enforcement and refunds; liens and schemes or devices. Grantees must comply with all conditions of the grant and any monies not spent or improperly spent must be returned immediately with interest to run at the normal rate for CCC obligations. Interest charges will be computed from the date of the CCC disbursement. Grantees must insure that parties that receive funds from the grantee comply with the grantee's application and return funds made available by the grantee where there is no such compliance. Any scheme or device to avoid any limits of this part will be considered to be a program violation with respect to any grant to which that scheme or device is related. Grant funds will be made available to the States or Tribes that are grantees under this part without regard to the claims of others, unless CCC determines otherwise.
