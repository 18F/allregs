Record this  weight. This reading is the tare weight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The filter shall then be stored in a covered petri dish which  shall remain   in the weighing chamber until needed for testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the filter is not used within one hour of its removal from  the weighing chamber, it shall be reweighed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The one hour limit may be replaced by an eight-hour limit if one  or both of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A stabilized filter is placed and kept in a sealed filter holder  assembly with the ends plugged, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A stabilized filter is placed in a sealed filter holder  assembly, which is then immediately placed in a sample line through  which there is no flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After the test, and after the sample filter is returned to the  weighing room, condition it for at least 1 hour but not more than 56  hours. Then weigh a second time. This latter reading is the gross weight  of the filter.
