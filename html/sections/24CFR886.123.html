                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance and operation. The Owner shall maintain and operate  the project so as to provide Decent, Safe, and Sanitary housing and he  shall provide all the services, maintenance and utilities which he  agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing  assistance payments or other applicable remedies if he fails to meet  these obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inspection prior to occupancy. Prior to occupancy of any unit by  a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit and both shall  certify, on forms prescribed by HUD that they have inspected the unit  and have determined it to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary in accordance  with the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these  reports shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic inspections. HUD will inspect or cause to be inspected  a reasonable sample of contract units at least annually and at such  other times as may be necessary to assure that the owner is meeting his  contractual obligations. HUD will take into account complaints by  occupants and any other information coming to its attention in  scheduling inspections and shall notify the owner of its determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Units not Decent, Safe, and Sanitary. If HUD notifies the Owner  that he has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in Decent, Safe, and  Sanitary condition and the Owner fails to take corrective action within  the time prescribed in the notice, HUD may exercise any of its rights or  remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing   assistance payments, even if the Family continues to occupy the unit.
