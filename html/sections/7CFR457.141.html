An irrigated practice commonly used for rice  production whereby the planted acreage is intentionally covered with  water that is maintained at a uniform and shallow depth throughout the  growing season.</p><p class="depth0">Harvest. Combining or threshing the rice for grain. A crop that is  swathed prior to combining is not considered harvested.</p><p class="depth0">Local market price. The cash price per pound for the U.S. No. 3  grade of rough rice offered by buyers in the area in which you normally  market the rice. Factors not associated with grading under the United  States Standards for Rice including, but not limited to, protein and oil  content or milling quality will not be considered.</p><p class="depth0">Planted acreage. In addition to the definition in section 1 of the  Basic Provisions, land on which there is uniform placement of an  adequate amount of rice seed into a prepared seedbed by one of the  following methods (Acreage seeded in any other manner will not be  insurable unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by  written agreement):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Drill seeding--Using a grain drill to incorporate the seed to a  proper soil depth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Broadcast seeding--Distributing seed evenly onto the surface of  an un-flooded seedbed followed by either timely mechanical incorporation  of the seed to a proper soil depth in the seedbed or flushing the  seedbed with water; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Broadcast seeding into a controlled flood--Distributing the rice  seed onto a prepared seedbed that has been intentionally covered to a  proper depth by water. The water must be free of movement and be  completely contained on the acreage by properly constructed levees and  gates.</p><p class="depth0">Saline water. Water that contains a concentration of salt sufficient  to cause damage to the insured crop.</p><p class="depth0">Second crop rice.

The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the  market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used  to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to  those that are usual, customary, and reasonable.
