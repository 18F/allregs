The requirements for chattel subordinations are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For loans secured by chattel, the subordination must meet the conditions contained in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (xiii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency will approve a request for a second subordination to enable a borrower to obtain crop insurance, if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The creditor to whom the first subordination was given did not provide for payment of the current year's crop insurance premium, and consents

in writing to the provisions of the second subordination to pay insurance premiums from the crop or insurance proceeds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower assigns the insurance proceeds to the Agency or names the Agency in the loss payable clause of the policy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The subordination meets the conditions under paragraphs (b)(1) through (12) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appraisals.
