                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are many different and complex arrangements by which  businesses may join to perform their activities for a common purpose. A  general discussion will be found in part 776 of this chapter. The  quotation in Sec. 779.229 from the Senate Report shows that Congress  recognized that some franchise, lease, or other arrangements have the  effect of creating a larger enterprise and whether they do or not  depends on the facts. The facts may show that the arrangements are so  restrictive as to deprive the individual establishment of those  prerogatives which are the essential attributes of an independent  business. (Compare Wirtz v. Lunsford, 404 F. 2d, 693 (C.A. 6).) An  establishment through such arrangements may transfer sufficient  ``control'' so that it becomes in effect a unit in a unified chain  operation. In such cases the result of the arrangement will be to create  a larger enterprise composed of the various segments, including the  establishment which relinquishes its control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term ``franchise'' is not susceptible of precise definition.  The extent to which a businessman relinquishes the control of his  business or the extent to which a franchise results in the performance  of the activities through unified operation or common control depends  upon the terms of the contract and the other relationships between the  parties. Ultimately the determination of the precise scope of such  arrangements which result in creating larger enterprises rests with the  courts.</p>
