                                Sec. 220.58  Objections to the designated physician or psychologist.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A claimant or his or her representative may object to his or her  being examined by a designated physician or psychologist. If there is a  good reason for the objection, the Board will schedule the examination  with another physician or psychologist. A good reason may be where the  consultative examination physician or psychologist had previously  represented an interest adverse to the claimant. For example, the  physician or psychologist may have represented the claimant's employer  in a worker's compensation case or may have been involved in an  insurance claim or legal action adverse to the claimant. Other things  the Board will consider are: language barrier, office location of  consultative examination physician or psychologist (2nd floor, no  elevator, etc.), travel restrictions, and examination by the physician  or psychologist in connection with a previous unfavorable determination.  If the objection is because a physician or psychologist allegedly  ``lacks objectivity'' (in general, but not in relation to the claimant  personally) the Board will review the allegations. To avoid a delay in  processing the claimant's claim, the consultative examination in such a  case will be changed to another physician or psychologist while a review  is being conducted. Any objection to use of the substitute physician or  psychologist will be handled in the same manner. However, if the Board  or the Social Security Administration had previously conducted such a  review and   found that the reports of the consultative physician or psychologist in  question conform to the Board's guidelines, then the Board will not  change the claimant's examination.</p>
