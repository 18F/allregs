The amount of the targeted jobs credit attributable to qualified first-year wages is equal to $192,600 (50% of $385,200).

Assume the facts in example 1 with these additional facts. A, a member of a targeted group, worked for more than one of the members of the controlled group in the taxable year. A first began work for Corporation M on January 1, 1980, and later worked for Corporations N and O during 1980. For services rendered by A during 1980, the following wages were paid to A: Corporation M paid A $2,500 of qualified first-year wages: Corporation N paid A $1,500 of qualified first-year wages; Corporation O paid A $3,000 of qualified first-year wages. Corporations M, N, and O paid A a total of $7,000 of wages during 1980. Only $6,000 of qualified first-year wages per year per employee may be taken into account for purposes of the credit. See Sec.  1.51-1(d)(1). Since Corporations M, N, and O are treated as a single employer under section 52(a), the maximum $6,000 of qualified first-year wages paid A by the group must be apportioned among Corporations M, N, and O as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.147</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corporation Q and its two subsidiaries, Corporations R and S, are a group of businesses that are under common control and each uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Corporation Q has a calendar year taxable year. Corporation R has a July 1 through June 30 taxable year. Corporation S has an October 1

through September 30 taxable year. For purposes of determining Corporation R's proportionate share of the credit, the credit is computed as if Corporations Q and S have the same taxable year as Corporation R. Accordingly, Corporation R would compute its share of the credit for its 1979-1980 taxable year as set forth below.

Since the qualified first-year wages of $285,000 exceeds 30 percent of the aggregate unemployment insurance wages, the group is limited to qualified first-year wages of $270,000 (30% of $900,000). The amount of the targeted jobs credit attributable to qualified first-year wages paid by members of the group during the period of the taxpayer's taxable year is $135,000 (50% of $270,000). The amount of the credit attributable to qualified second-year wages paid or incurred by members of the group during the period of the taxpayer's taxable year is $35,000 (25% of $140,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The credit is apportioned to Corporation R on the basis of its proportionate share of the qualified first-year wages and qualified second-year wages giving rise to the credit.

In the case of a group of trades or businesses that are under common control at any time during the calendar year, the amount of the new jobs credit (computed under section 51 as if all the organizations that are under common control are one trade or business) under section 44B (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) must be apportioned among the members of the group on the basis of each member's proportionate contribution to the increase in unemployment insurance wages for the entire group. The limitations in section 53 (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) and the regulations thereunder apply to each organization individually (although, in applying these limitations, an affiliated group of corporations electing to make a consolidated return shall be treated as one organization). The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corporation T and its three subsidiaries, U, V, and W, are a group of businesses that are under common control and each has a calendar year taxable year. Corporations T, U, V, and W have paid out the following amounts in unemployment insurance wages during 1976 and 1977:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Increase in</p><p class="depth0">FUTA wages</p><p class="depth0">1976         1977       in 1977</p><p class="depth0">over 1976------------------------------------------------------------------------Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">T..............................   $1,000,000   $1,015,000     +$15,000</p><p class="depth0">U..............................      500,000      650,000     +150,000</p><p class="depth0">V..............................      600,000      580,000      -20,000</p><p class="depth0">W..............................       40,000      100,000      +60,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total........................    2,140,000    2,345,000      205,000------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Since all employees of trades or, businesses that are under common control are treated as employed by a single employer, the computations in section 51 are performed as if all the organizations which are under common control are one trade or business. Consequently, the amounts of the total unemployment insurance wages of the group in 1976 (i.e., $2,140,000) and 1977 (i.e., $2,345,000) are used to determine the increase in unemployment insurance wages in 1977 over the 1976 wage base. Since the amount equal to 102 percent of the 1976 unemployment insurance wages ($2,182,800) is greater than the amount equal to 50 percent of the 1977 unemployment insurance wages ($1,172,500), the increase in unemployment insurance wages in 1977 over the 1976 wage base is $162,200 ($2,345,000-$2,182,800). The limitations in section 51(c), (d), and (g) (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) must

also be computed as though all the organizations under common control are one trade or business. For purposes of this example, it is assumed that none of those limitations reduce the amount of increase in unemployment insurance wages. As a result, the amount of the new jobs credit allowed to the group of business is $81,100 (50% of $162,200).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The credit is apportioned among Corporations T, U, and W on the basis of their proportionate contributions to the increase in unemployment insurance wages. No credit would be allowed to Corporation V because it did not contribute to the increase in the group's unemployment insurance wages. Corporation T's share of the credit would be $5,406.66 ($81,100x($15,000/$225,000 (i.e., $15,000+$150,000+$60,000))), Corporation U's share would be $54,066.67 ($81,100x($150,000/225,000)), and Corporation W's share would be $21,626.67 ($81,100x($60,000/$225,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Trades or businesses that are under common control. For purposes of this section, the term ``trades or businesses that are under common control'' means any group of trades or businesses that is either a ``parent-subsidiary group under common control'' as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, a ``brother-sister group under common control'' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, or a ``combined group under common control'' as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.52-2 and 1.52-3, the term ``organization'' means a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a trust, an estate, or a corporation. An organization may be a member of only one group of trades or businesses under common control. If, without the application of this paragraph, an organization would be a member of more than one such group, that organization shall indicate in its timely filed return the group in which it is being included. If the organization does not so indicate, then the district director with audit jurisdiction of the organization's return will determine the group in which the organization is to be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Parent-subsidiary group under common control--(1) In general.

for purposes of the effective control requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Controlling interest defined. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``controlling interest'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a corporation, ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of the shares of all classes of stock of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In case of a trust or estate, ownership of an actuarial interest (determined under paragraph (f) of this section) of a least 80 percent of the trust or estate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a partnership, ownership of at least 80 percent of the profit interest or capital interest of the partnership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a sole proprietorship, ownership of the sole proprietorship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective control defined.
