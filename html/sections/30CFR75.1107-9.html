Sodium bicarbonate is denser than ammonium phosphate; hence, for example, a 50-pound system designed for the sodium bicarbonate will hold slightly more by weight than all-purpose dry chemical (ammonium phosphate) by weight. The word ``nominal'' is used in Sec. 75.1107-9 to express the approximate weight in pounds of all-purpose dry chemical.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On unattended underground equipment, the number of pounds of dry chemical employed by the system shall be not less than 1 pound per square foot of top surface area of the equipment; however, the minimum amount in any system shall be 20 pounds (nominal). The discharge shall be directed into and on potentially hazardous locations of the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On attended underground equipment, the number of pounds (nominal) employed by the system shall equal 5 times the total number of hazardous locations; however, the minimum amount in any system shall not be less than the following, except that systems on haulage vehicles installed prior to the effective date of this section may contain 20 pounds (nominal).
