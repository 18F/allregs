                            <p class="depth0">``Serious damage'' means any specific defect defined in this  section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these  defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects which seriously  detract from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the  apple. In addition, specific defect measurements are based on an apple  three inches in diameter. Corresponding smaller or larger areas would be  allowed on smaller or larger fruit. Any reference to ``inch'' or  ``inches in diameter'' refers to that of a circle of the specified  diameter. Any reference to ``aggregate area,'' ``total area,'' or  ``aggregate affected area'' means the gathering together of separate  areas into one mass for the purpose of comparison to determine the  extent affected. The following specific defects shall be considered as  serious damage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following types and amounts of russeting shall be considered  as serious damage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Smooth solid russeting, when more than one-half of the surface  in the aggregate is covered, including any russeting in the stem cavity  or calyx basin, or slightly rough, or excessively rough or bark-like  russeting, which detracts from the appearance of the fruit to a greater  extent than the amount of smooth solid russeting permitted: Provided,  That any amount of russeting shall be permitted on Roxbury Russet and  other similar varieties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sunburn or sprayburn which seriously detracts from the  appearance of the fruit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limb rubs which affect more than one-tenth of the surface in the  aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Hail marks, drought spots, or scars, if they materially deform  or disfigure the fruit, or if such defects affect more than one-tenth of  the surface in the aggregate: Provided, That no hail marks which are  unhealed shall be permitted and not more than an aggregate area of one- half inch shall be allowed   for well healed hail marks where the skin has been broken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Stem or calyx cracks which are not well healed, or well healed  stem or calyx cracks which exceed an aggregate length of one-half inch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Visible water core which affects an area of more than one-half  inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disease: (1) Scab spots which affect a total area of more than  three-fourths inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cedar rust infection which affects a total area of more than  three-fourths inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sooty blotch or fly speck which affects more than one-third of  the surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Red skin spots which affect more than one-third of the surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Bitter pit or Jonathan spot which is thinly scattered over more  than one-tenth of the surface.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Insects: (1) Healed stings which affect a total area of more  than one-fourth inch in diameter including any encircling discolored  rings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Worm holes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bruises which are not slight and incident to proper handling and  packing, and which are greater than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> \3/8\ inch in depth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 1\1/8\ inches in diameter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> any combination of lesser bruises which detract from the  appearance or edible quality of the apple to an extent greater than any  one bruise described in paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Brown surface discoloration when caused by delayed sunburn,  surface scald, or any other means and affects an area greater than \3/4\  inch in diameter.</p>
