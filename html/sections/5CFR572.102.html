                            <p class="depth0">Payment of travel expenses for any individual candidate or appointee  will be at the discretion of the employing agency. A decision by one  agency that payment is appropriate for a particular position does not  require a like determination by any other agency filling similar  positions. A decision made in connection with one specific vacancy does  not require a like decision in connection with future vacancies. In  deciding to pay travel and transportation or interview expenses in  filling any position, the agency should consider such factors as  availability of funds as well as the desirability of conducting  interviews for a particular job or offering a recruiting incentive to a  particular candidate.</p>
