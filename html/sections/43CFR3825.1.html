                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The procedure in the location of mining claims, performance of annual labor and the prosecution of patent proceedings therefor shall be the same as provided by the United States mining laws and regulations thereunder, with the additional requirements prescribed in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to complying with the existing laws and regulations governing the recording of mining locations with the proper local recording officer, the locator of a mining claim within the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation shall furnish to the superintendent or other officer in charge of the reservation, within 90 days of such location, a copy of the location notice, together with a sum amounting to 5 cents for each acre and 5 cents for each fractional part of an acre embraced in the location for deposit with the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Tohono O'Odham Tribe as yearly rental. Failure to make the required annual rental payment in advance each year until an application for patent has been filed for the claim shall be deemed sufficient grounds for invalidating the

claim. The payment of annual rental must be made to the superintendent or other officer in charge of the reservation each year on or prior to the anniversary date of the mining location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a mining claim is located within the reservation, the locator shall pay to the superintendent or other officer in charge of the reservation damages for the loss of any improvements on the land in such a sum as may be determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be a fair and reasonable value of such improvements, for the credit of the owner thereof. The value of such improvements may be fixed by the Commissioner, Bureau of Indian Affairs, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and payment in accordance with such determination shall be made within 1 year from date thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the time of filing with the manager an application for mineral patent for lands within the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation the applicant shall furnish, in addition to the showing required under the general mining laws, a statement from the superintendent or other officer in charge of the reservation, that he has deposited with the proper official in charge of the reservation for deposit in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Tohono O'Odham Tribe a sum equal to $1 for each acre and $1 for each fractional part of an acre embraced in the application for patent in lieu of annual rental, together with a statement from the superintendent or other officer in charge of the reservation that the annual rentals have been paid each year and that damages for loss of improvements, if any, have been paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Act provides that in case patent is not acquired the sum deposited in lieu of annual rentals shall be refunded. Where patent is not acquired, such sums due as annual rentals but not paid during the period of patent application shall be deducted from the sum deposited in lieu of annual rental. Applications for refund shall be filed in the office of the manager and should follow the general procedure in applications for repayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Water reservoirs, charcos, water holes, springs, wells, or any other form of water development by the United States or the Tohono O'Odham Indians shall not be used for mining purposes under the terms of the said Act of August 28, 1937, except under permit from the Secretary of the Interior approved by the Tohono O'Odham Indian Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A mining location may not be located on any portion of a 10 acre legal subdivision containing water reservoirs, charcos, water holes, springs, wells or any other form of water development by the United States or the Indians except under a permit from the Secretary of the Interior approved by the Tohono O'Odham Indian Council which permit shall contain such stipulations, restrictions, and limitations regarding the use of the land for mining purposes as may be deemed necessary and proper to permit the free use of the water thereon by the United States or the Tohono O'Odham Indians.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term locator wherever used in this section shall include and mean his successors, assigns, grantees, heirs, and all others claiming under or through him.
