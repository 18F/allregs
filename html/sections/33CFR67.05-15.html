During construction and until such time as a platform capable of supporting the obstruction lights is completed, the fixed lights on an attending vessel shall be used. In addition, when lights are in use for general illumination to facilitate the construction or operation of a structure, and can be seen from any angle of approach at a distance equal to that prescribed for the obstruction lights for the class of structure, the actual operation of obstruction lights also will not be required.
