                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Consequences of nondiversification--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for purposes of subchapter L, section 72, and section 7702(a), a variable contract (as defined in section 817(d)), other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818(a)), which is based on one or more segregated asset accounts shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any calendar quarter period for which the investments of any such account are not adequately diversified. For this purpose, a variable contract shall be treated as based on a segregated asset account for a calendar quarter period if amounts received under the contract (or earnings thereon) are allocated to the segregated asset account at any time during the period. In addition, a variable contract that is not treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period by reason of this paragraph (a)(1) shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any subsequent period even if the investments are adequately diversified for such subsequent period. If a variable contract which is a life insurance or endowment contract under other applicable (e.g., State or foreign) law is not treated as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702(a), the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder is treated as ordinary income received or

accrued by the policyholder during such year in accordance with section 7702 (g) and (h). Likewise, if a variable contract is not treated as an annuity contract under section 72, the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder shall be treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in the same manner as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702 (g) and (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for purposes of subchapter L, section 72, and section 7702(a), a variable contract (as defined in section 817(d)), other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818(a)), which is based on one or more segregated asset accounts shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any calendar quarter period for which the investments of any such account are not adequately diversified. For this purpose, a variable contract shall be treated as based on a segregated asset account for a calendar quarter period if amounts received under the contract (or earnings thereon) are allocated to the segregated asset account at any time during the period. In addition, a variable contract that is not treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period by reason of this paragraph (a)(1) shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any subsequent period even if the investments are adequately diversified for such subsequent period. If a variable contract which is a life insurance or endowment contract under other applicable (e.g., State or foreign) law is not treated as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702(a), the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder is treated as ordinary income received or

accrued by the policyholder during such year in accordance with section 7702 (g) and (h). Likewise, if a variable contract is not treated as an annuity contract under section 72, the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder shall be treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in the same manner as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702 (g) and (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inadvertent failure to diversify. The investments of a segregated asset account shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for one or more periods, provided the following conditions are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issuer or holder must show the Commissioner that the failure of the investments to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for such period or periods was inadvertent,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The investments of the account must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section within a reasonable time after the discovery of such failure, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The issuer or holder of the variable contract must agree to make such adjustments or pay such amounts as may be required by the Commissioner with respect to the period or periods during which the investments of the account did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Diversification of investments--(1) In general. (i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section, the investments of a segregated asset account shall be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

A segregated asset account will be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The account meets the requirements of section 851 (b)(4) and the regulations thereunder; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the account is attributable to cash, cash items (including receivables), government securities, and securities of other regulated investment companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alternative diversification requirements for variable life insurance contracts. (i) A segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts will be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section are satisfied or if the assets of such account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the percentage limitations prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section increased by the product of (A) .5 and (B) the percentage of the value of the total assets of the account that is represented by Treasury securities. In determining whether the assets of an account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the increased percentage limitations, such limitations are applied as if the Treasury securities were not included in the account (i.e., the increased percentage limitations are not applied to Treasury securities and the value of the total assets of the account is reduced by the value of the Treasury securities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts will be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section are satisfied or if the assets of such account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the percentage limitations prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section increased by the product of (A) .5 and (B) the percentage of the value of the total assets of the account that is represented by Treasury securities. In determining whether the assets of an account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the increased percentage limitations, such limitations are applied as if the Treasury securities were not included in the account (i.e., the increased percentage limitations are not applied to Treasury securities and the value of the total assets of the account is reduced by the value of the Treasury securities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year, a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts holds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the account are represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $90,000 and securities of Corporation A having a total value of $10,000. The 55% limit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increased by 45% (0.5x90%) to 100%, and would then be applied to the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Because no more than 100% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporation A, the investments of the account will be considered adequately diversified.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year, a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts holds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the account are represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $60,000, securities of Corporation A having a total value of $30,000, and securities of Corporation B having a total value of $10,000. The 55% and 70% limits described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increased by 30% (0.5x60%) to 85% and 100%, respectively, and would then be applied to the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Securities of Corporation A represent 75%, and securities of Corporation B represent 25%, of the value of the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Because no more than 85% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporation A or B and no more than 100% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporations A and B, the investments of the account will be considered adequately diversified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Periods for which an account is adequately diversified--(1) In general. A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the last day of a quarter of a calendar year (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31) or within 30 days after such last day shall be considered adequately diversified for such quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the last day of a quarter of a calendar year (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31) or within 30 days after such last day shall be considered adequately diversified for such quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Start-up period. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregated asset account that is not a real property account on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversified until such first anniversary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregated asset account that is not a real property account on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversified until such first anniversary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregated asset account that is a real property account on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversified until the earlier of its fifth anniversary or the anniversary on which the account ceases to be a real property account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, the anniversary of a segregated asset account is the anniversary of the date on which any amount received under a life insurance or annuity contract, other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818 (a)), is first allocated to the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated asset account as of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contracts entered into more than one year before such date, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply to the segregated asset account for any period after such date. Similarly, if more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated asset account as of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contracts entered into more than 5 years before such date, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall not apply to the segregated asset account for any period after such date. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), amounts transferred to the account from a diversified account (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(2)) or as a result of an exchange pursuant to section 1035 in which the issuer of the contract received in the exchange is not related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to the issuer of the contract transferred in the exchange are not treated as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than one year before such date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than five years before such date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liquidation period. A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the date a plan of liquidation is

adopted shall be considered adequately diversified for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The one-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation is adopted if the account is not a real property account on such date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The two-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation is adopted if the account is a real property account on such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Market fluctuations. A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section at the end of any calendar quarter (or within 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter) shall not be considered nondiversified in a subsequent quarter because of a discrepancy between the value of its assets and the diversification requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any asset and such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Segregated asset account. For purposes of section 817(h) and this section, a segregated asset account shall consist of all assets the investment return and market value of each of which must be allocated in an identical manner to any variable contract invested in any of such assets. See paragraph (g) for examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Look-through rule for assets held through certain investment companies, partnerships, or trusts--(1) In general. If this paragraph (f) applies, a beneficial interest in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, a partnership, or a trust that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as owned by the grantor or another person (``investment company, partnership, or trust'') shall not be treated as a single investment of a segregated asset account. Instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment company, partnership, or trust shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an asset of the segregated asset account. For purposes of this section, the ratable interest of a partner in a partnership's assets shall be determined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If this paragraph (f) applies, a beneficial interest in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, a partnership, or a trust that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as owned by the grantor or another person (``investment company, partnership, or trust'') shall not be treated as a single investment of a segregated asset account. Instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment company, partnership, or trust shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an asset of the segregated asset account. For purposes of this section, the ratable interest of a partner in a partnership's assets shall be determined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability--(i) Certain investment companies, partnerships, and trusts. This paragraph (f) shall apply to an investment company, partnership, or trust if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain investment companies, partnerships, and trusts. This paragraph (f) shall apply to an investment company, partnership, or trust if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All the beneficial interests in the investment company, partnership, or trust (other than those described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Public access to such investment company, partnership, or trust is available exclusively (except as otherwise permitted in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) through the purchase of a variable contract. Solely for this purpose, the status of a contract as a variable contract will be determined without regard to section 817(h) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trusts holding Treasury securities. This paragraph (f) shall also apply to a trust that is treated under section 671 through 679 as owned by the grantor or another person if substantially all of the assets of the trust are represented by Treasury securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interests not held by segregated asset accounts. Satisfaction of the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall not be prevented by reason of beneficial interests in the investment company, partnership, or trust that are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Held by the general account of a life insurance company or a corporation related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to a life insurance company, but only if the return on such interests is computed in the same manner as the return on an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed (determined without regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts), there is no intent to sell such interests to the public, and a segregated asset account of such life insurance company also holds or will hold a beneficial interest in the investment company, partnership, or trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Held by the manager, or a corporation related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to the manager, of the investment company, partnership, or trust, but only if the holding of the interests is in connection with the creation or management of the investment company, partnership, or trust,

the return on such interest is computed in the same manner as the return on an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed (determined without regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts), and there is no intent to sell such interests to the public;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Held by a qualified tuition program as defined in section 529;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Held by the trustee of a pension plan established and maintained outside of the United States, as defined in section 7701(a)(9), primarily for the benefit of individuals substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens, as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Held by an account which, pursuant to Puerto Rican law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the life insurance company that owns the account, provided the requirements of section 817(d) and (h) are satisfied. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(vi), the requirement under section 817(d)(1) that the account be segregated pursuant to State law or regulation shall be disregarded and Sec. 1.817-5(f)(1) shall be applied without regard to the Puerto Rican segregated asset account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Held by the public, or treated as owned by policyholders pursuant to Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12, but only if (A) the investment company, partnership, or trust was closed to the public in accordance with Rev. Rul. 82-55, 1982-1 C.B. 12, or (B) all the assets of the segregated asset account are attributable to premium payments made by policyholders prior to September 26, 1981, to premium payments made in connection with a qualified pension or retirement plan, or to any combination of such premium payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The assets underlying variable contracts issued by a life insurance company consist of two groups of assets: (a) a diversified portfolio of debt securities and (b) interests in P, a partnership. All of the beneficial interests in P are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies and public access to P is available exclusively through the purchase of a variable contract. The variable contracts provide that policyholders may specify which portion of each premium is to be invested in the debt securities and which portion is to be invested in P interests. The portfolio of debt securities and the assets of P, considered separately, each satisfy the diversification requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As a result of the ability of policyholders to allocate premiums among the two groups of assets, the investment return and market value of the interests in P and the debt securities may be allocated to different variable contracts in a non-identical manner. Accordingly, under paragraph (e) of this section, the interests in P are treated as part of a single segregated asset account (``Account 1'') and the debt securities are treated as part of a different segregated asset account (``Account 2'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Since P is described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, interests in P will not be treated as a single investment of Account 1. Rather, Account 1 is treated as owning a pro rata portion of the assets of P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Since Account 1 and Account 2 each satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, variable contracts that are based on either or both accounts are treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that some of the beneficial interests in P are held by persons not described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Since P is not described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, interests in P will be treated as a single investment of Account 1. As a result, Account 1 does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Variable contracts based in whole or in part on Account 1 are not treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. Variable contracts that are not based on Account 1 at any time during the period in which such account fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section (i.e., contracts based entirely on Account 2), are treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. See paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that the variable contracts do not permit policyholders to allocate premiums between or among the debt securities and interests in P. Thus, the investment return and market value of the interests in P and the debt securities must be allocated to the same variable contracts and in an identical manner. Under paragraph (e) of this section, the interests in P and the debt securities are treated as part of a single segregated asset account. If the interests in P and the debt securities, considered together, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of

this section, contracts based on this segregated asset account will be treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Definitions. The terms defined below shall, for purposes of this section, have the meanings set forth in such definitions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Government security--(i) General rule. The term government security shall mean any security issued or guaranteed or insured by the United States or an instrumentality of the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing. Any security or certificate or deposit insured or guaranteed only in part by the United States or an instrumentality thereof is treated as issued by the United States or its instrumentality only to the extent so insured or guaranteed, and as issued by the direct obligor to the extent not so insured or guaranteed. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), an instrumentality of the United States shall mean any person that is treated for purposes of 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 (16), as amended, as a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The term government security shall mean any security issued or guaranteed or insured by the United States or an instrumentality of the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing. Any security or certificate or deposit insured or guaranteed only in part by the United States or an instrumentality thereof is treated as issued by the United States or its instrumentality only to the extent so insured or guaranteed, and as issued by the direct obligor to the extent not so insured or guaranteed. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), an instrumentality of the United States shall mean any person that is treated for purposes of 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 (16), as amended, as a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. A segregated asset account purchases a certificate of deposit in the amount of $150,000 from bank A. Deposits in bank A are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an instrumentality of the United States, to the extent of $100,000 per depositor. The certificate of deposit is treated as a government security to the extent of the $100,000 insured amount and is treated as a security issued by bank A to the extent of the $50,000 excess of the value of the certificate of deposit over the insured amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treasury security--(i) General rule. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and section 817(h)(3), the term Treasury security shall mean a security the direct obligor of which is the United States Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and section 817(h)(3), the term Treasury security shall mean a security the direct obligor of which is the United States Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. A segregated asset account purchases put and call options on U.S. Treasury securities issued by the Options Clearing Corporation. The options are not Treasury securities for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) and section 817(h)(3) because the direct obligor of the options is not the United States Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Real property. The term real property shall mean any property that is treated as real property under 1.856-3 (d) except that it shall not include interests in real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Real property account. A segregated asset account is a real property account on an anniversary of the account (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) or on the date a plan of liquidation is adopted if not less than the applicable percentage of the total assets of the account is represented by real property or interests in real property on such anniversary or date. For this purpose, the applicable percentage is 40% for the period ending on the first anniversary of the date on which premium income is first received, 50% for the year ending on the second anniversary, 60% for the year ending on the third anniversary, 70% for the year ending on the fourth anniversary, and 80% thereafter. A segregated asset account will also be treated as a real property account on its first anniversary if on or before such first anniversary the issuer has stated in the contract or prospectus or in a submission to a regulatory agency, an intention that the assets of the account will be primarily invested in real property or interests in real property, provided that at least 40% of the total assets of the account are so invested within six months after such first anniversary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commodity. The term commodity shall mean any type of personal property other than a security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Security. The term security shall include a cash item and any partnership interest, whether or not registered under a Federal or State law regulating the offering or sale of securities. The term shall not include any interest in real property, or any interest in a commodity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Interest in real property. The term interest in real property shall include the ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon and leaseholds of land or improvements thereon. Such term shall not, however, include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests, such

as a retained economic interest in coal or iron ore with respect to which the special provisions of section 631(c) apply. The term ``interest in real property'' also shall include options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Interest in a commodity. The term interest in a commodity shall include the ownership and co-ownership of any type of personal property other than a security, and any leaseholds thereof. Such term shall include mineral, oil, and gas royalty interests, including any fractional undivided interest therein. Such term also shall include any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any type of personal property other than a security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Value. The term value shall mean, with respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such investments; and with respect to other investments, fair value as determined in good faith by the managers of the segregated asset account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Terms used in section 851.

Sec. 1.817A-1  Certain modified guaranteed contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--(1) Modified guaranteed contract. The term modified guaranteed contract (MGC) is defined in section 817A(d) as an annuity, life insurance, or pension plan contract (other than a variable contract described in section 817) under which all or parts of the amounts received under the contract are allocated to a segregated account. Assets and reserves in this segregated account must be valued from time to time with reference to market values for annual statement purposes. Further, an MGC must provide either for a net surrender value or for a policyholder's fund (as defined in section 807(e)(1)). If only a portion of a contract is not described in section 817, such portion is treated as a separate contract for purposes of applying section 817A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Modified guaranteed contract. The term modified guaranteed contract (MGC) is defined in section 817A(d) as an annuity, life insurance, or pension plan contract (other than a variable contract described in section 817) under which all or parts of the amounts received under the contract are allocated to a segregated account. Assets and reserves in this segregated account must be valued from time to time with reference to market values for annual statement purposes. Further, an MGC must provide either for a net surrender value or for a policyholder's fund (as defined in section 807(e)(1)). If only a portion of a contract is not described in section 817, such portion is treated as a separate contract for purposes of applying section 817A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Temporary guarantee period. An MGC may temporarily guarantee a return other than the permanently guaranteed crediting rate for a period specified in the contract (the temporary guarantee period). During the temporary guarantee period, the amount paid to the policyholder upon surrender is usually increased or decreased by a market value adjustment, which is determined by a formula set forth under the terms of the MGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equity-indexed modified guaranteed contract. An equity-indexed MGC is an MGC, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that provides a return during or at the end of the temporary guarantee period based on the performance of stocks, other equity instruments, or equity-based derivatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-equity-indexed modified guaranteed contract. A non-equity-indexed MGC is an MGC, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that provides a return during or at the end of the temporary guarantee period not based on the performance of stocks, other equity instruments, or equity-based derivatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Current market rate for non-equity-indexed modified guaranteed contracts. The current market rate for a non-equity-indexed MGC issued by an insurer (whether issued in that tax year or a previous one) is the appropriate Treasury constant maturity interest rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the month containing the last day of the insurer's taxable year. The appropriate rate is that rate published for Treasury securities with the shortest published maturity that is greater than (or equal to) the remaining duration of the current temporary guarantee period under the MGC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Current market rate for equity-indexed modified guaranteed contracts. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable interest rates for non-equity-indexed modified guaranteed contracts--(1) Tax reserves during temporary guarantee period. An insurance company is required to determine the tax reserves for an MGC under sections 807(c)(3) or (d)(2). During a non-equity-indexed MGC's temporary guarantee period, the applicable interest rate to be used under sections 807(c)(3) and (d)(2)(B) is the current market rate, as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax reserves during temporary guarantee period. An insurance company is required to determine the tax reserves for an MGC under sections 807(c)(3) or (d)(2). During a non-equity-indexed MGC's temporary guarantee period, the applicable interest rate to be used under sections 807(c)(3) and (d)(2)(B) is the current market rate, as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required interest during temporary guarantee period. During the temporary guarantee period of a non-equity-indexed MGC, the applicable interest rate to be used to determine required interest under section 812(b)(2)(A) is the same current market rate, defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, that applies for that period for purposes of sections 807(c)(3) or (d)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of section 811(d). An additional reserve computation rule applies under section 811(d) for contracts that guarantee certain interest payments beyond the end of the taxable year. Section 811(d) is waived for non-equity-indexed MGCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Periods after the end of the temporary guarantee period. For periods after the end of the temporary guarantee period, sections 807(c)(3), 807(d)(2)(B), 811(d) and 812(b)(2)(A) are

not modified when applied to non-equity-indexed MGCs. None of these sections are affected by the definition of current market rate contained in paragraph (a)(5) of this section once the temporary guarantee period has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> IC, a life insurance company as defined in section 816, issues a MGC (the Contract) on August 1 of 1996. The Contract is an annuity contract that gives rise to life insurance reserves, as defined in section 816(b). IC is a calendar year taxpayer. The Contract guarantees that interest will be credited at 8 percent per year for the first 8 contract years and 4 percent per year thereafter. During the 8-year temporary guarantee period, the Contract provides for a market value adjustment based on changes in a published bond index and not on the performance of stocks, other equity instruments or equity based derivatives. IC has chosen to avail itself of the provisions of these regulations for 1996 and taxable years thereafter. The 10-year Treasury constant maturity interest rate published for December of 1996 was 6.30 percent. The next shortest maturity published for Treasury constant maturity interest rates is 7 years. As of the end of 1996, the remaining duration of the temporary guarantee period for the Contract was 7 years and 7 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To determine under section 807(d)(2) the end of 1996 reserves for the Contract, IC must use a discount interest rate of 6.30 percent for the temporary guarantee period. The interest rate to be used in computing required interest under section 812(b)(2)(A) for 1996 reserves is also 6.30 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The discount rate applicable to periods outside the 8-year temporary guarantee period is determined under sections 807(c)(3), 807(d)(2)(B), 811(d) and 812(b)(2)(A) without regard to the current market rate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that it is now the last day of 1998. The remaining duration of the temporary guarantee period under the Contract is now 5 years and 7 months. The 7-year Treasury constant maturity interest rate published for December of 1998 was 4.65 percent. The next shortest duration published for Treasury constant maturity interest rates is 5 years. A discount rate of 4.65 percent is used for the remaining duration of the temporary guarantee period for the purpose of determining a reserve under section 807(d) and for the purpose of determining required interest under section 812(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that it is now the last day of 2001. The remaining duration of the temporary guarantee period under the Contract is now 2 years and 7 months. The 3-year Treasury constant maturity interest rate published for December of 2001 was 3.62 percent. The next shortest duration published for Treasury constant maturity interest rates is 2 years. A discount rate of 3.62 percent is used for the remaining duration of the temporary guarantee period for the purpose of determining a reserve under section 807(d) and for the purpose of determining required interest under section 812(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicable interest rates for equity-indexed modified guaranteed contracts. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of this section are effective on May 7, 2003. However, pursuant to section 7805(b)(7), taxpayers may elect to apply those paragraphs retroactively for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995, the effective date of section 817A.
