                                Sec. 1002.61  Does USERRA cover a member of the Reserve Officers
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, under certain conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Membership in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) or the  Junior ROTC is not ``service in the uniformed services.'' However, some  Reserve and National Guard enlisted members use a college ROTC program  as a means of qualifying for commissioned officer status. National Guard  and Reserve members in an ROTC program may at times, while participating  in that program, be receiving active duty and inactive duty training  service credit with their unit. In these cases, participating in ROTC  training sessions is considered ``service in the uniformed services,''  and qualifies a person for protection under USERRA's reemployment and  anti-discrimination provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Typically, an individual in a College ROTC program enters into  an agreement with a particular military service that obligates such  individual to either complete the ROTC program and accept a commission  or, in case he or she does not successfully complete the ROTC program,  to serve as an enlisted member. Although an individual does not qualify  for reemployment protection, except as specified in (a) above, he or she  is protected under   USERRA's anti-discrimination provisions because, as a result of the  agreement, he or she has applied to become a member of the uniformed  services and has incurred an obligation to perform future service.</p>
