                                Sec. 1202.5  How do I request information from FHFA or FHFA-OIG
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where to send your request. FOIA requests must be in writing. You may make a request for FHFA or FHFA-OIG records by writing directly to FHFA's FOIA Office through electronic mail, mail, delivery service, or facsimile. The electronic mail address is: foia@fhfa.gov. For mail or delivery service, the mailing address is: FOIA Officer, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Eighth Floor, Washington, DC 20024. The facsimile number is: (202) 649-1073. Requests for FHFA-OIG records will be forwarded to FHFA-OIG for processing and direct response. You can help FHFA and FHFA-OIG process your request by marking electronic mail, letters, or facsimiles and the subject line, envelope, or facsimile cover sheet with ``FOIA Request.'' FHFA's ``Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide,''

which is available on FHFA's Web site, http://www.fhfa.gov, provides additional information to assist you in making your request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provide your name and address. Your request must include your full name, your address and, if different, the address at which FHFA or FHFA-OIG is to notify you about your request, a telephone number at which you can be reached during normal business hours, and an electronic mail address, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request is under FOIA. Your request must have a statement identifying it as being made under FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Your FOIA status. If you are submitting your request as a ``commercial use'' requester, an ``educational institution'' requester, a ``non-commercial scientific institution'' requester, or a ``representative of the news media'' for the purposes of the fee provisions of FOIA, your request should include a statement specifically identifying your status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Describing the records you request. You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable FHFA or FHFA-OIG personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Your request should include as much specific information as possible that you know about each record you request, such as the date, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter, or file designations, or the description of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> How you want the records produced to you. Your request must tell FHFA or FHFA-OIG whether you will inspect the records before duplication or want them duplicated and furnished without inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agreement to pay fees. In your FOIA request you must agree to pay all applicable fees charged under Sec. 1202.11, up to $100.00, unless you seek a fee waiver. When making a request, you may specify a higher or lower amount you will pay without consultation. Your inability to pay a fee does not justify granting a fee waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Valid requests. FHFA and FHFA-OIG will only process valid requests. A valid request must meet all the requirements of this part.
