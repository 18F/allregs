                            <p class="depth0">While the text of the policy which follows is exemplary of a contract acceptable to the Commission as evidence of the financial protection required of the licensee by section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, variations on this text submitted by the licensee also will be considered by the Commission in determining whether the licensee meets the financial protection requirements of the Act. The full text of the policy is published solely for the purpose of completeness. Publication of this text should not be construed as a Commission endorsement of any particular provision pertaining solely to the business relationship between the insurers and the insureds or to any other matter not within the Commission's statutory jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act.</p><p class="depth0">Nuclear Energy Liability Policy</p><p class="depth0">(Facility Form)</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned members of ----------, hereinafter called the ``companies,'' each for itself, severally and not jointly, and in the respective proportions hereinafter set forth, agree with the insured, named in the declarations made a part hereof, in consideration of the premium and in reliance upon the statements in the declarations and subject to the limit of liability, exclusions, conditions and other terms of this policy;</p><p class="depth0">insuring agreements</p><p class="depth0">I.

With respect to bodily injury sustained by any employee of an insured and caused by the nuclear energy hazard, to pay to the workmen's compensation carrier of such insured all sums which such carrier would have been entitled to recover and retain as damages from another person or organization, had such person or organization alone been legally responsible for such bodily injury, by reason of the rights acquired by subrogation by the payment of the benefits required of such carrier under the applicable workmen's compensation or occupational disease law. An employer who is a duly qualified self-insurer under such law shall be deemed to be a workmen's compensation carrier within the meaning of this coverage. This Coverage C does not apply to bodily injury sustained by any person who is employed at and in connection with the facility. This Coverage C shall not constitute workmen's compensation insurance as required under the laws of any state.</p><p class="depth0">II. Definition of insured.

The named insured shall pay the companies the advance premium stated in the declarations, for the period from the effective date of this policy through December 31 following. Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar year while this policy is in force, the named insured shall pay the advance premium for such year to the companies. The advance premium for each calendar year shall be stated in the Advance Premium Endorsement for such calendar year issued to the named insured as soon as practicable prior to or after the beginning of such year.</p><p class="depth0">As soon as practicable after each December 31 and after the termination of this policy, the standard premium for the preceding calendar year shall be finally determined and stated in the Standard Premium Endorsement for that calendar year.

A portion of the reserve premium for this policy for the first calendar year of any group of ten consecutive calendar years shall be returnable to the named insured provided there is a reserve for refunds at the end of the tenth calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Computation of reserve premium refunds. The reserve premium refund due the named insured for any calendar year shall be determined by multiplying any industry reserve premium refund for such calendar year by the policy refund ratio for such calendar year. The reserve premium refund for any calendar year shall be finally determined as soon as practicable after July 1 of the tenth calendar year thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Final premium. The final premium for this policy shall be the sum of the standard premiums for each calendar year, or portion thereof, during which this policy remains in force less the sum of all refunds of reserve premiums due the named insured under the provisions of this Condition 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reserve premium refund agreement. Each member of Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters subscribing this policy for any calendar year, or portion thereof, thereby agrees for itself, severally and not jointly, and in the respective proportion of its liability assumed under this policy for that calendar year, to return to the named insured that portion of any reserve premium refund due the named insured for that calendar year, determined in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Inspection; suspension. The companies shall be permitted to inspect the facility and to examine the insured's books and records

at any time, as far as they relate to the subject-matter of this insurance.</p><p class="depth0">If a representative of the companies discovers a condition which he believes to be unduly dangerous with respect to the nuclear energy hazard, a representative of the companies may request that such condition be corrected without delay. In the event of noncompliance with such request, a representative of the companies may, by notice to the named insured, to any other person or organization considered by the companies to be responsible for the continuance of such dangerous condition, and to the United States Atomic Energy Commission, suspend the insurance with respect to the named insured and such other person or organization effective 12:00 midnight of the next business day of such Commission following the date that such Commission receives such notice. The period of such suspension shall terminate as of the time stated in a written notice from the companies to the named insured and to each such person or organization that such condition has been corrected.</p><p class="depth0">3. Limit of liability; termination of policy upon exhaustion of limit. Regardless of the number of persons and organizations who are insureds under this policy, and regardless of the number of claims made and suits brought against any or all insureds because of one or more occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage caused during the policy period by the nuclear energy hazard, the limit of the companies' liability stated in the declarations is the total liability of the companies for their obligations under this policy and the expenses incurred by the companies in connection with such obligations, including.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Payments in settlement of claims and in satisfaction of judgments against the insureds for damages because of bodily injury or property damage, payments made under parts (2), (3) and (4) of Coverage A and payments made in settlement of claims under Coverages B and C;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payments for expenses incurred in the investigation, negotiation, settlement and defense of any claim or suit, including, but not limited to, the cost of such services by salaried employees of the companies, fees and expenses of independent adjusters, attorneys' fees and disbursements, expenses for expert testimony, inspection and appraisal of property, examination, X-ray or autopsy or medical expenses of any kind;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payments for expenses incurred by the companies in investigating an occurrence resulting in bodily injury or property damage or in minimizing its effects.
Each payment made by the companies in discharge of their obligations under this policy or for expenses incurred in connection with such obligations shall reduce by the amount of such payment the limit of the companies' liability under this policy.</p><p class="depth0">If, during the policy period or subsequent thereto, the total of such payments made by the companies shall exhaust the limit of the companies' liability under this policy, all liability and obligations of the companies under this policy shall thereupon terminate and shall be conclusively presumed to have been discharged. This policy, if not theretofore canceled, shall thereupon automatically terminate.</p><p class="depth0">Regardless of the number of years this policy shall continue in force and the number of premiums which shall be payable or paid, the limit of the companies' liability stated in the declarations shall not be cumulative from year to year.</p><p class="depth0">4. Limitation of liability; common occurrence. Any occurrence or series of occurrences resulting in bodily injury or property damage arising out of the radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nuclear material discharged or dispersed from the facility over a period of days, weeks, months or longer and also arising out of such properties of other nuclear material so discharged or dispersed from one or more other nuclear facilities insured by the companies under a Nuclear Energy Liability Policy (Facility Form), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste in the course of transportation for which insurance is afforded under this policy and also arising out of such properties of other source material, special nuclear material, spent fuel or waste in the course of transportation for which insurance is afforded under one or more other Nuclear Energy Liability Policies (Facility Form) issued by the companies, shall be deemed to be a common occurrence resulting in bodily injury or property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard.</p><p class="depth0">With respect to such bodily injury and property damage (1) the total aggregate liability of the companies under all Nuclear Energy Liability Policies (Facility Form), including this policy, applicable to such common occurrence shall be the sum of the limits of liability of all such policies, the limit of liability of each such policy being as determined by Condition 3 thereof, but in no event shall such total aggregate liability of the companies exceed $--------------;\1\ (2) the total liability of the companies under this policy shall not exceed that proportion of the total aggregate liability of the companies, as stated in clause (1) above, which (a) the limit of liability of this policy, as determined by Condition 3, bears to (b) the sum of

the limits of liability of all such policies issued by the companies, the limit of liability of each such policy being as determined by Condition 3, thereof.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For policies issued by Nuclear Energy Liability-Property Insurance Association the amount will be ``$124,000,000,'' for policies issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, the amount will be ``$36,000,000.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The provisions of this condition shall not operate to increase the limit of the companies' liability under this policy.</p><p class="depth0">5. Notice of occurrence, claim, or suit. In the event of bodily injury or property damage to which this policy applies or of an occurrence which may give rise to claims therefor, written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and circumstances thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses, shall be given by or for the insured to ------------or the companies as soon as practicable. If claim is made or suit is brought against the insured, he shall immediately forward to ---------- or the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received by him or his representative.</p><p class="depth0">6. Assistance and cooperation of the insured. The insured shall cooperate with the companies and, upon the companies' request, attend hearings and trials and assist in making settlements, securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance. The insured shall not, except at his own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.</p><p class="depth0">7. Action against companies--Coverages A and C. No action shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the companies.</p><p class="depth0">Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy. No person or organization shall have any right under this policy to join the companies or any of them as parties to any action against the insured to determine the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the insured or his legal representative. Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured's estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their obligations hereunder.</p><p class="depth0">8. Action against companies--Coverage B. No suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim for property damage to which Coverage B applies shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with and unless commenced within two years after the occurrence resulting in such property damage.</p><p class="depth0">9. Insured's duties when loss occurs--Coverage B. In the event of property damage to which Coverage B applies, the insured shall furnish a complete inventory of the property damage claimed, showing in detail the amount thereof. Within ninety-one days after the occurrence resulting in such property damage, unless such time is extended in writing by the companies, the insured shall render to the companies a proof of loss, signed and sworn to by the insured, stating the knowledge and belief of the insured as to the following: identification of such occurrence; the interest of the insured in the property destroyed or damaged, and the amount of each item of property damage claimed; all encumbrances on such property; and all other contracts of insurance, whether valid or not, covering any of such property. The insured shall include in the proof of loss a copy of all descriptions and schedules in all policies. Upon the companies' request, the insured shall furnish verified plans and specifications of any such property. The insured, as often as may be reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by the companies any of such property, and submit to examinations under oath by any person named by the companies and subscribe the same; and, as often as may be reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books of account, records, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies thereof if originals be lost, at such reasonable time and place as may be designated by the companies or their representatives, and shall permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.</p><p class="depth0">10. Appraisal--Coverage B. In case the insured and the companies shall fail to agree as to the amount of property damage, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within twenty days of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire and, failing for fifteen days to agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or the companies, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property is located. The appraisers shall then appraise each item of property damage and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences only to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with the companies shall determine the amount of property damage. Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of the appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally. The companies shall not be held to have waived any of their rights by any act relating to appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">11. Subrogation. In the event of any payment under this policy, the companies shall be subrogated to all the insured's rights of recovery therefor against any person or organization, and the insured shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. Prior to knowledge of bodily injury or property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard the insured may waive in writing any right or recovery against any person or organization, but after such knowledge the insured shall not waive or otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery.</p><p class="depth0">The companies hereby waive any rights of subrogation acquired against the United States of America or any of its agencies by reason of any payment under this policy.</p><p class="depth0">The companies do not relinquish, by the foregoing provisions, any right to restitution from the insured out of any recoveries made by the insured on account of a loss covered by this policy of any amounts to which the companies would be entitled had such provisions, or any of them, not been included in this policy.</p><p class="depth0">12. Other insurance. If the insurance afforded by this policy for loss or expense is concurrent with insurance afforded for such loss or expense by a Nuclear Energy Liability Policy (Facility Form) issued to the named insured by ---------- hereinafter called ``concurrent insurance,'' the companies shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss or expense than the limit of liability stated in the declarations of this policy bears to the sum of such limit and the limit of liability stated in the declarations of such concurrent policy.</p><p class="depth0">If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than such concurrent insurance or any other nuclear energy liability insurance issued by the companies or ---------- to any person or organization) applicable to loss or expense covered by this policy, the insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over such other insurance; provided, with respect to any person who is not employed at and in connection with the facility, such insurance as is afforded by this policy for bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment shall be primary insurance under such other insurance.</p><p class="depth0">13. Changes. Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this policy or stop the companies from asserting any right under the terms of this policy; nor shall the terms of this policy be waived or changed except by endorsement issued to form a part of this policy executed by ---------- on behalf of the companies.</p><p class="depth0">14. Assignment. Assignment of interest by the named insured shall not bind the companies until their consent is endorsed hereon; if, however, the named insured shall die or be declared bankrupt or insolvent, this policy shall cover such insured's legal representative, receiver or trustee as an insured under this policy, but only with respect to his liability as such, and then only provided written notice of his appointment as legal representative, receiver or trustee is given to the companies within ten days after such appointment.</p><p class="depth0">15. Cancellation. This policy may be canceled by the named insured by mailing to the companies and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective. This policy may be canceled by the companies by mailing to the named insured at the address shown in this policy and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than ninety days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; provided in the event of non-payment of premium or if the operator of the facility, as designated in the declarations, is replaced by another person or organization, this policy may be canceled by the companies by mailing to the named insured at the address shown in this policy and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective. The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice. The effective date and hour of cancellation stated in the notice shall become the end of the policy period. Delivery of such written notice either by the named insured or by the companies shall be equivalent to mailing.</p><p class="depth0">Upon termination or cancellation of this policy, other than as of the end of December 31 in any year, the earned premium for the period this policy has been in force since the preceding December 31 shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If this policy is terminated, pursuant to Condition 3, by reason of the exhaustion of the limit of the companies' liability, all premium theretofore paid or payable shall be fully earned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the named insured cancels, the earned premium for such period shall be computed in accordance with the customary annual short rate table and procedure, provided if the named insured cancels after knowledge of bodily injury or property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard, all premiums theretofore paid or payable shall be fully earned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the companies cancel, the earned premium for such period shall be computed pro rata.
Premium adjustment, if any, may be made either at the time cancellation is effected or as soon as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment or tender of

unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any notice, sworn statement or proof of loss which may be required by the provisions of this policy may be given to any one of the companies, and such notice, statement or proof of loss so given shall be valid and binding as to all companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In any action or suit against the companies, service of process may be made on any one of them, and such service shall be deemed valid and binding service on all companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ---------- is the agent of the companies with respect to all matters pertaining to this insurance.
