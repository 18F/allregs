                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Applications must contain all information requested on  the applicable form and any additional information required by the rules  in this chapter and any rules pertaining to the specific service for  which the application is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reference to material on file. Questions on application forms  that call for specific technical data, or that can be answered yes or no  or with another short answer, must be answered on the form. Otherwise,  if documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already on file with  the FCC contain information required in an application, the application  may incorporate such information by reference, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The referenced information has been filed in ULS or, if manually  filed outside of ULS, the information comprises more than one ``8\1/2\ x  11'' page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The referenced information is current and accurate in all  material respects; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application states specifically where the referenced  information can actually be found, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The station call sign or application file number and its  location if the reference is to station files or previously filed  applications;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal  citations, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Antenna locations. Applications for stations at fixed locations  must describe each transmitting antenna site by its geographical  coordinates and also by its street address, or by reference to a nearby  landmark. Geographical coordinates, referenced to NAD83, must be  specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of  latitude and longitude.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Antenna structure registration. Owners of certain antenna  structures must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register  with the Commission as required by part 17 of this chapter. Applications  proposing the use of one or more new or existing antenna structures must  contain the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) of each  structure for which registration is required. To facilitate frequency  coordination or for other purposes, the Bureau shall accept for filing  an application that does not contain the FCC Antenna Structure  Registration Number so long as;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The antenna structure owner has filed an antenna structure  registration application (FCC Form 854);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The antenna structure owner has provided local notice and the  Commission has posted notification of the proposed construction on its  Web site pursuant to Sec. 17.4(c)(3) and (4) of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The antenna structure owner has obtained a Determination of No  Hazard to Aircraft Navigation from the Federal Aviation Administration.  In such instances, the applicant shall provide the FCC Form 854 File  Number on its application. Once the antenna structure owner has obtained  the Antenna Structure Registration Number, the applicant shall amend its  application to provide the Antenna Structure Registration Number, and  the Commission shall not grant the application before the Antenna  Structure Registration Number has been provided. If registration is not  required, the applicant must provide information in its application  sufficient for the Commission to verify this fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Environmental concerns. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Environmental processing shall be  completed pursuant to the process set forth in Sec. 17.4(c) of this  chapter for any facilities that use one or more new or existing antenna  structures for which a new or amended registration is required by part  17 of this chapter. Environmental review by the Commission must be  completed prior to construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For applications that propose any facilities that are not  subject to the process set forth in Sec. 17.4(c) of this chapter, the  applicant is required to indicate at the time its application is filed  whether or not a Commission grant of the application for those  facilities may have a significant environmental effect as defined by  Sec. 1.1307. If the applicant answers affirmatively, an   Environmental Assessment, required by Sec. 1.1311 must be filed with the  application and environmental review by the Commission must be completed  prior to construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> International coordination. Channel assignments and/or usage  under this part are subject to the applicable provisions and  requirements of treaties and other international agreements between the  United States government and the governments of Canada and Mexico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Quiet zones. Each applicant is required to comply with the  ``Quiet Zone'' rule (see Sec. 1.924).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Taxpayer Identification Number (TINs). Wireless applicants and  licensees, including all attributable owners of auctionable licenses as  defined by Sec. 1.2112 of this part, are required to provide their  Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINS) (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6109) to  the Commission, pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996  (DCIA). Under the DCIA, the FCC may use an applicant or licensee's TIN  for purposes of collecting and reporting to the Department of the  Treasury any delinquent amounts arising out of such person's  relationship with the Government. The Commission will not publicly  disclose applicant or licensee TINs unless authorized by law, but will  assign a ``public identification number'' to each applicant or licensee  registering a TIN. This public identification number will be used for  agency purposes other than debt collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Unless an exception is set forth elsewhere in this chapter, each  applicant must specify an address where the applicant can receive mail  delivery by the United States Postal Service. This address will be used  by the Commission to serve documents or direct correspondence to the  applicant.
