The entire radioactive surface of the source shall be wiped with filter paper, moistened with water, with the application of moderate finger pressure. Removal of radioactive material from the source shall be determined by measuring the radioactivity on the filter paper after

it has dried or by direct measurement of the radioactivity on the source following the wet wipe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Water soak test. The source shall be immersed in water at room temperature for a period of 24 consecutive hours. The source shall then be removed from the water.

This test shall be performed by wiping the entire radioactive surface of the source with a filter paper with the application of moderate finger pressure. The radioactivity on the paper shall be measured by using radiation detection instrumentation capable of detecting 0.005 microcurie of plutonium. If any such test discloses more than 0.005 microcurie of radioactive material, the source shall be deemed to be leaking or losing plutonium and shall not be transferred to a general licensee under Sec. 70.19.
