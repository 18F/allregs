                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following  definitions shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CLEC shall mean a local exchange carrier that provides some or  all of the interstate exchange access services used to send traffic to  or from an end user and does not fall within the definition of  ``incumbent local exchange carrier'' in 47 U.S.C. 251(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Competing ILEC shall mean the incumbent local exchange carrier,  as defined in 47 U.S.C. 251(h), that would provide interstate exchange  access services, in whole or in part, to the extent those services were  not provided by the CLEC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Switched exchange access services shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The functional equivalent of the ILEC interstate exchange access  services typically associated with the following rate elements: Carrier  common line (originating); carrier common line (terminating); local end  office switching; interconnection charge; information surcharge; tandem  switched transport termination (fixed); tandem switched transport  facility (per mile); tandem switching;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The termination of interexchange telecommunications traffic to  any end user, either directly or via contractual or other arrangements  with an affiliated or unaffiliated provider of interconnected VoIP  service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(25), or a non-interconnected VoIP  service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(36), that does not itself seek to  collect reciprocal compensation charges prescribed by this subpart for  that traffic, regardless of the specific functions provided or  facilities used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-rural ILEC shall mean an incumbent local exchange carrier  that is not a rural telephone company under 47 U.S.C. 153(44).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rate for interstate switched exchange access services shall  mean the composite, per-minute rate for these services, including all  applicable fixed and traffic-sensitive charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rural CLEC shall mean a CLEC that does not serve (i.e.,  terminate traffic to or originate traffic from) any end users located  within either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any incorporated place of 50,000 inhabitants or more, based on  the most recently available population statistics of the Census Bureau  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urbanized area, as defined by the Census Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (g) of this  section, a CLEC shall not file a tariff for its interstate switched  exchange access services that prices those services above the higher of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rate charged for such services by the competing ILEC or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lower of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The benchmark rate described in paragraph (c) of this section or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of interstate switched exchange access service, the  lowest rate that the CLEC has tariffed for its interstate exchange  access services, within the six months preceding June 20, 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The benchmark rate for a CLEC's switched exchange access  services will be the rate charged for similar services by the competing  ILEC. If an ILEC to which a CLEC benchmarks its rates, pursuant to this  section, lowers the rate to which a CLEC benchmarks, the CLEC must  revise its rates to the lower level within 15 days of the effective date  of the lowered ILEC rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, and  notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in the event  that, after June 20, 2001, a CLEC begins serving end users in a  metropolitan statistical area (MSA) where it has not previously served  end users, the CLEC shall not file a tariff for its exchange access  services in that MSA that prices those services above the rate charged  for such services by the competing ILEC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rural exemption. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this  section, and notwithstanding paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section,  a rural CLEC competing with a non-rural ILEC shall not file a tariff for  its interstate exchange access services that prices those services above  the rate prescribed in the NECA access tariff, assuming the highest rate  band for local switching. In addition to that NECA rate, the rural CLEC  may assess a presubscribed interexchange carrier charge if, and only to  the extent that, the competing ILEC assesses this charge. Beginning July  1, 2013, all CLEC reciprocal compensation rates for intrastate switched  exchange access services subject to this subpart also   shall be no higher than that NECA rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a CLEC provides some portion of the switched exchange access  services used to send traffic to or from an end user not served by that  CLEC, the rate for the access services provided may not exceed the rate  charged by the competing ILEC for the same access services, except if  the CLEC is listed in the database of the Number Portability  Administration Center as providing the calling party or dialed number,  the CLEC may, to the extent permitted by Sec. 51.913(b) of this  chapter, assess a rate equal to the rate that would be charged by the  competing ILEC for all exchange access services required to deliver  interstate traffic to the called number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A CLEC engaging in access stimulation, as that term is defined  in Sec. 61.3(bbb), shall not file a tariff for its interstate exchange  access services that prices those services above the rate prescribed in  the access tariff of the price cap LEC with the lowest switched access  rates in the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A CLEC engaging in access stimulation, as that term is defined  in Sec. 61.3(bbb), shall file revised interstate switched access  tariffs within forty-five (45) days of commencing access stimulation, as  that term is defined in Sec. 61.3(bbb), or within forty-five (45) days  of [date] if the CLEC on that date is engaged in access stimulation, as  that term is defined in Sec. 61.3(bbb).
