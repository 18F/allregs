                            <p class="depth0">Where a prize is awarded for the quality, quantity or efficiency of  work done by the employee during his customary working hours at his  normal assigned tasks (whether on the employer's premises or elsewhere)  it is obviously paid as additional remuneration for employment. Thus  prizes paid for cooperation, courtesy, efficiency, highest production,  best attendance, best quality of work, greatest number of overtime hours  worked, etc., are part of the regular rate of pay. If the prize is paid  in cash, the amount paid must be allocated (for the method of allocation  see Sec. 778.209) over the period during which   it was earned to determine the resultant increase in the average hourly  rate for each week of the period. If the prize is merchandise, the cost  to the employer is the sum which must be allocated. Where the prize is  either cash or merchandise, with the choice left the employee, the  amount to be allocated is the amount (or the cost) of the actual prize  he accepts.</p>
