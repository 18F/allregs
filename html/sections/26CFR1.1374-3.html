                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is  the total of the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount that would be the amount realized if, at the  beginning of the first day of the recognition period, the corporation  had remained a C corporation and had sold all its assets at fair market  value to an unrelated party that assumed all its liabilities; decreased  by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any liability of the corporation that would be included in the  amount realized on the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, but only if the corporation would be allowed a deduction on  payment of the liability; decreased by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The aggregate adjusted bases of the corporation's assets at the  time of the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;  increased or decreased by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The corporation's section 481 adjustments that would be taken  into account on the sale referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section; and increased by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any recognized built-in loss that would not be allowed as a  deduction under section 382, 383, or 384 on the sale referred to in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment to net unrealized built-in gain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If  section 1374(d)(8) applies to an S corporation's acquisition of assets,  some or all of the stock of the corporation from which such assets were  acquired was taken into account in the computation of the net unrealized  built-in gain for a pool of assets of the S corporation, and some or all  of such stock is redeemed or canceled in such transaction, then, subject  to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such net  unrealized built-in gain is adjusted to eliminate any effect that any  built-in gain or built-in loss in the redeemed or canceled stock (other  than stock with respect to which a loss under section 165 is claimed)  had on the initial computation of net unrealized built-in gain for that  pool of assets. For purposes of this paragraph, stock described in  section 1374(d)(6) shall be treated as taken into account in the  computation of the net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets of  the S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Recognized built-in gain or loss.  Net unrealized built-in gain for a pool of assets of the S corporation  is only adjusted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to reflect  built-in gain or built-in loss in the redeemed or canceled stock that  has not resulted in recognized built-in   gain or recognized built-in loss during the recognition period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Anti-duplication rule. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall  not be applied to duplicate an adjustment to the net unrealized built-in  gain for a pool of assets made pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of adjustment. Any adjustment to the net unrealized  built-in gain made pursuant to this paragraph (b) only affects  computations of the amount subject to tax under section 1374 for taxable  years that end on or after the date of the acquisition to which section  1374(d)(8) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pool of assets. For purposes of this section, a pool of assets  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The assets held by the corporation on the first day it became an  S corporation, if the corporation was previously a C corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The assets the S corporation acquired from a C corporation in a  section 1374(d)(8) transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> X, a  calendar year C corporation using the cash method, elects to become an S  corporation on January 1, 1996. On December 31, 1995, X has assets and  liabilities as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Assets                           FMV       Basis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Factory..........................................    $500,000   $900,000 Accounts Receivable..............................     300,000          0 Goodwill.........................................     250,000          0</p><p class="depth0">----------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total..........................................   1,050,000    900,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Liabilities                             Amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mortgage.....................................................   $200,000 Accounts Payable.............................................    100,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total......................................................    300,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Further, X must include a total of $60,000 in taxable income in  1996, 1997, and 1998 under section 481(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, on December 31, 1995, X sold all its assets to a third  party that assumed all its liabilities, X's amount realized would be  $1,050,000 ($750,000 cash received + $300,000 liabilities assumed =  $1,050,000). Thus, X's net unrealized built-in gain is determined as  follows:  Amount realized...........................................    $1,050,000 Deduction allowed (A/P)...................................     (100,000) Basis of X's assets.......................................     (900,000) Section 481 adjustments...................................        60,000 Net unrealized built-in gain..............................       110,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar year C  corporation, elects to become an S corporation effective January 1,  2005. On that date, X's assets (the first pool of assets) have a net  unrealized built-in gain of $15,000. Among the assets in the first pool  of assets is all of the outstanding stock of Y, a C corporation, with a  fair market value of $33,000 and an adjusted basis of $18,000. On March  1, 2009, X sells an asset that it owned on January 1, 2005, and as a  result has $10,000 of recognized built-in gain. X has had no other  recognized built-in gain or built-in loss. X's taxable income limitation  for 2009 is $50,000. Effective June 1, 2009, X elects under section 1361  to treat Y as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary (QSub). The election  is treated as a transfer of Y's assets to X in a liquidation to which  sections 332 and 337(a) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built  in-gain of the first pool of assets is adjusted to account for the  elimination of the Y stock in the liquidation. The net unrealized built- in gain of the first pool of assets, therefore, is decreased by $15,000,  the amount by which the fair market value of the Y stock exceeded its  adjusted basis as of January 1, 2005. Accordingly, for taxable years  ending after June 1, 2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first  pool of assets is $0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1374-2(a), X's net recognized built-in gain for  any taxable year equals the least of X's pre-limitation amount, taxable  income limitation, and net unrealized built-in gain limitation. In 2009,  X's pre-limitation amount is $10,000, X's taxable income limitation is  $50,000, and X's net unrealized built-in gain limitation is $0. Because  the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets has been  adjusted to $0, despite the $10,000 of recognized built-in gain in 2009,  X has $0 net recognized built-in gain for the taxable year ending on  December 31, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar year C  corporation, elects to become an S corporation effective January 1,  2005. On that date, X's assets (the first pool of assets) have a net  unrealized built-in gain of negative $5,000. Among the assets in the  first pool of assets is 10 percent of the outstanding stock of Y, a C  corporation, with a fair market value of $18,000 and an adjusted basis  of $33,000. On March 1, 2009, X sells an asset that it owned on January  1, 2005, resulting in $8,000 of recognized built-in gain. X has had no  other recognized built-in gains or built-in losses. X's taxable income  limitation for 2009 is $50,000. On June 1, 2009, Y transfers its assets  to X in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built  in-gain of the first pool   of assets is adjusted to account for the elimination of the Y stock in  the reorganization. The net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool  of assets, therefore, is increased by $15,000, the amount by which the  adjusted basis of the Y stock exceeded its fair market value as of  January 1, 2005. Accordingly, for taxable years ending after June 1,  2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets is  $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1374-2(a), X's net recognized built-in gain for  any taxable year equals the least of X's pre-limitation amount, taxable  income limitation, and net unrealized built-in gain limitation. In 2009,  X's pre-limitation amount is $8,000 and X's taxable income limitation is  $50,000. The net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets  has been adjusted to $10,000, so X's net unrealized built-in gain  limitation is $10,000. X, therefore, has $8,000 net recognized built-in  gain for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2009. X's net  unrealized built-in gain limitation for 2010 is $2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar year C corporation, elects to  become an S corporation effective January 1, 2005. On that date, X's  assets (the first pool of assets) have a net unrealized built-in gain of  $30,000. Among the assets in the first pool of assets is all of the  outstanding stock of Y, a C corporation, with a fair market value of  $45,000 and an adjusted basis of $10,000. Y has no current or  accumulated earnings and profits. On April 1, 2007, Y distributes  $18,000 to X, $8,000 of which is treated as gain to X from the sale or  exchange of property under section 301(c)(3). That $8,000 is recognized  built-in gain to X under section 1374(d)(3), and results in $8,000 of  net recognized built-in gain to X for 2007. X's net unrealized built-in  gain limitation for 2008 is $22,000. On June 1, 2009, Y transfers its  assets to X in a liquidation to which sections 332 and 337(a) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the net unrealized built  in-gain of the first pool of assets is adjusted to account for the  elimination of the Y stock in the liquidation. The net unrealized built- in gain of that pool of assets, however, can only be adjusted to reflect  the amount of built-in gain that was inherent in the Y stock on January  1, 2005 that has not resulted in recognized built-in gain during the  recognition period. In this case, therefore, the net unrealized built-in  gain of the first pool of assets cannot be reduced by more than $27,000  ($35,000, the amount by which the fair market value of the Y stock  exceeded its adjusted basis as of January 1, 2005, minus $8,000, the  recognized built-in gain with respect to the stock during the  recognition period). Accordingly, for taxable years ending after June 1,  2009, the net unrealized built-in gain of the first pool of assets is  $3,000. The net unrealized built-in gain limitation for 2009 is $0.
