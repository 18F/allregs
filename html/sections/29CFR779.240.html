                                Sec. 779.240  Employees ``handling * * * or otherwise working on goods.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ``Goods'' upon which the described activities are performed. Employees will be considered to be handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods within the meaning of section 3(s) if they engage in the described activities on ``goods'' which ``have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person.'' They may be handling or working on such goods which the enterprise does not sell. The term ``goods'' is defined in section 3(i) of the Act. The definition is explained in Sec. 779.107 and discussed comprehensively in part 776 of this chapter. As defined in section 3(i) of the Act, the term includes any part or ingredient of ``goods'' and, in general, includes ``articles or subjects of commerce of any character.'' Thus the term ``goods,'' as used in section 3(s), includes all goods which have been moved in or produced for commerce, such as stock-in-trade, or raw materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``Handling * * * or otherwise working on goods.'' The term ``handling * * * or otherwise working on goods'' used in section 3(s) is substantially the same as the term used since 1938 in section 3(j) of the Act. Both terms will therefore be considered to have essentially the same meaning. (See part 776 of this chapter, the interpretative bulletin on the general coverage of the Act.) Thus, the activities encompassed in the term ``handling or in any other manner working on goods'' in section 3(s) are the same as the activities, encompassed in the similar term in section 3(j), by which goods are ``produced'' within the meaning of the Act. In general, the term ``handling * * * or otherwise working on goods'' includes employees who sort, screen, grade, store, pack, label, address, transport, deliver, print, type, or otherwise handle or work on the goods. The same will be true of employees who handle or work

on ``any part of ingredient of the goods'' referred to in the discussion of the term ``goods'' in Sec. 779.107. An employee will be considered engaged in ``handling * * * or otherwise working on goods,'' within the meaning of section 3(s), only if he performs the described activities on goods that ``have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person.'' This requirement is discussed in Sec. Sec. 779.242 and 779.243.</p>
