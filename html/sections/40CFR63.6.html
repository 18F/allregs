These records may take the form of a ``checklist,'' or other effective form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and describes the actions taken for that event. In addition, the owner or operator must keep records of these events as specified in paragraph 63.10(b), including records of the occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown (if the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction of operation and each malfunction of the air pollution control and monitoring equipment. Furthermore, the owner or operator shall confirm that actions taken during the relevant reporting period during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction were consistent with the affected source's startup, shutdown and malfunction plan in the semiannual (or more frequent) startup, shutdown, and malfunction report required in Sec. 63.10(d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If an action taken by the owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including an action taken to correct a malfunction) is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and the source exceeds any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standard, then the owner or operator must record the actions taken for that event and must report such actions within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event, in accordance with Sec. 63.10(d)(5) (unless the owner or operator makes alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the Administrator).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The owner or operator must maintain at the affected source a current startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. In addition,

if the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is subsequently revised as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section, the owner or operator must maintain at the affected source each previous (i.e., superseded) version of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and must make each such previous version available for inspection and copying by the Administrator for a period of 5 years after revision of the plan. If at any time after adoption of a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan the affected source ceases operation or is otherwise no longer subject to the provisions of this part, the owner or operator must retain a copy of the most recent plan for 5 years from the date the source ceases operation or is no longer subject to this part and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. The Administrator may at any time request in writing that the owner or operator submit a copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (or a portion thereof) which is maintained at the affected source or in the possession of the owner or operator. Upon receipt of such a request, the owner or operator must promptly submit a copy of the requested plan (or a portion thereof) to the Administrator. The owner or operator may elect to submit the required copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to the Administrator in an electronic format. If the owner or operator claims that any portion of such a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is confidential business information entitled to protection from disclosure under section 114(c) of the Act or 40 CFR 2.301, the material which is claimed as confidential must be clearly designated in the submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection or submitted when requested by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Based on the results of a determination made under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator must require appropriate revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Does not address a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event that has occurred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fails to provide for the operation of the source (including associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment) during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event in a manner consistent with the general duty to minimize emissions established by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control and monitoring equipment as quickly as practicable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Includes an event that does not meet the definition of startup, shutdown, or malfunction listed in Sec. 63.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The owner or operator may periodically revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the affected source as necessary to satisfy the requirements of this part or to reflect changes in equipment or procedures at the affected source. Unless the permitting authority provides otherwise, the owner or operator may make such revisions to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan without prior approval by the Administrator or the permitting authority. However, each such revision to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan must be reported in the semiannual report required by Sec. 63.10(d)(5). If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator must revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed

procedures for operating and maintaining the source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control and monitoring equipment. In the event that the owner or operator makes any revision to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which alters the scope of the activities at the source which are deemed to be a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, or otherwise modifies the applicability of any emission limit, work practice requirement, or other requirement in a standard established under this part, the revised plan shall not take effect until after the owner or operator has provided a written notice describing the revision to the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The title V permit for an affected source must require that the owner or operator develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which conforms to the provisions of this part, but may do so by citing to the relevant subpart or subparagraphs of paragraph (e) of this section. However, any revisions made to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan in accordance with the procedures established by this part shall not be deemed to constitute permit revisions under part 70 or part 71 of this chapter and the elements of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan shall not be considered an applicable requirement as defined in Sec. 70.2 and Sec. 71.2 of this chapter. Moreover, none of the procedures specified by the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for an affected source shall be deemed to fall within the permit shield provision in section 504(f) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with nonopacity emission standards--(1) Applicability. The non-opacity emission standards set forth in this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, and as otherwise specified in an applicable subpart.

Any Federal Register notice under this paragraph shall be published only after the public is notified and given the opportunity to comment. Such notice will restrict the permission to the stationary source(s) or category(ies) of sources from which the alternative emission standard will achieve equivalent emission reductions.
