                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requesting party means an interested party described in section  771(9) (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act was not applicable  at the time such order was issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> WTO Agreement means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade  Organization entered into on April 15, 1994.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for review. A requesting party may file with the  Commission a request for an investigation under section 753 of the Act  within the time period established by section 753(a)(3) of the Act. The  request should contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description and identification of the relevant domestic like  product, the industry in the United States producing that product that  is likely to be materially injured by reason of imports of the subject  merchandise if the Order is revoked, and each individual member of that  industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information reasonably available to the requesting party  concerning the names and addresses of all known enterprises believed to  be manufacturing, producing, exporting, or importing the subject  merchandise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information reasonably available to the requesting party  documenting that the industry described in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section is likely to be materially injured by reason of subject imports  if the Order is revoked, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information concerning the capacity, production, sales, market  share, inventories, employment, wages, productivity, profits, ability to  raise capital, and development and production efforts of the industry  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information concerning current and projected production  capacity in the exporting country of the subject merchandise,  inventories of the subject merchandise, and the existence of barriers to  the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information concerning any scope and anticircumvention rulings  issued by the administering authority with respect to the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initiation of Investigation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the receipt of a timely  filed request for a section 753 investigation satisfying the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary shall  publish a notice of initiation of such investigation in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a section 753  investigation shall be completed within one year of the date of  publication of the notice of initiation of such investigation in the  Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may take more than one year to complete section  753 investigations for which requests for investigations are received  within one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into  force with respect to the United States. All such investigations must be  completed within four years of that date, however. In determining  whether to extend the completion date for a section 753 investigation,  the Commission shall consult with the administering authority. Grounds  for extending completion include, but are not limited to, the desire to  conduct investigations involving the same or similar domestic industries  and domestic like products on a simultaneous basis, and the desire to  efficiently manage the Commission's caseload.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conduct of Investigations. The procedures set forth in subparts  A and C of this part shall apply to all investigations initiated under  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When No Request for Review Is Filed. When there has been no  properly filed and sufficient request for a section 753 investigation of  an Order, the Commission shall notify the administering authority that a  negative determination has been made under section 753(a) of the Act  with respect to that Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pending and Suspended Section 303 Investigations. If, on the  data on which a country becomes a signatory to the Agreement on  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures referred to in section 101(d)(12)  of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, there is a section 303  countervailing duty investigation in progress or suspended with respect  to that country's merchandise for which the requirement of a material  injury determination under section 303(a)(2) of the Act was not  applicable at the time the investigation was initiated, the Commission  shall commence an investigation pursuant to the provisions of section  753(c) of the Act with respect to pending investigations and suspended  investigations to which section 704(i)(1)(B) of the Act applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Request for simultaneous section 751(c) review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A requesting  party who requests a section 753 review may at the same time request  from the Commission and the administering authority a review under  section 751(c) of the Act of a countervailing or antidumping duty order  involving the same or comparable subject merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Should the administering authority, after consulting with the  Commission, determine to initiate a section 751(c) review, the  Commission shall conduct a consolidated review under sections 751(c) and  753 of the Act of the orders involving the same or comparable subject  merchandise. Any such consolidated review shall be conducted   under the applicable procedures set forth in subparts A and F of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Should the administering authority, after consulting with the  Commission, determine not to initiate a section 751(c) review, the  Commission will consider the request for a section 753 review pursuant  to the procedures established in this section.
