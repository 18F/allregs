                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. You may make a request for records of the Foundation by writing to the General Counsel, Morris K. Udall Foundation, 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, Arizona 85701-1650. If you are making a request for records about yourself, see Sec. 1600.21 for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records about another individual, either a written authorization signed by

that individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) will help the processing of your request. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope ``Freedom of Information Act Request.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records sought. You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable Foundation personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If the Foundation determines that your request does not reasonably describe records, it will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. If your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, the response to your request may be delayed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Types of records not available. The FOIA does not require the Foundation to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the Foundation must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed of.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreement to pay fees. If you make a FOIA request, your request shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under Sec. 1600.10, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. The Foundation ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</p>
