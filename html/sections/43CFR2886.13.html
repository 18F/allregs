                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you hold a grant or TUP, you are liable to the United States  and to third parties for any damage or injury they incur in connection  with your use and occupancy of the right-of-way or TUP area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You are strictly liable for any activity or facility associated  with your right-of-way or TUP area which BLM determines presents a  foreseeable hazard or risk of damage or injury to the United States. BLM  will specify in the grant or TUP any activity or facility posing such  hazard or risk, and the financial limitations on damages commensurate  with such hazard or risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BLM will not impose strict liability for damage or injury  resulting primarily from an act of war or the negligence of the United  States, except as otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in this section, strict liability extends to costs  incurred by the Federal government to control or abate conditions, such  as fire or oil spills, which threaten life, property, or the  environment, even if the threat occurs to areas that are not under  Federal jurisdiction. This liability is separate and apart from  liability under other provisions of law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are strictly liable to the United States for damage or  injury up to $2 million for any one incident. BLM will update this  amount annually to adjust for changes in the Consumer Price Index for  All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average (CPI-U) as of July of each year  (difference in CPI-U from July of one year to July of the following  year), rounded to the nearest $1,000. This financial limitation does not  apply to the release or discharge of hazardous substances on or near the  grant or TUP area, or where liability is otherwise not subject to this  financial limitation under applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> BLM will determine your liability for any amount in excess of  the $2 million strict liability limitation (as adjusted) through the  ordinary rules of negligence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rules of subrogation apply in cases where a third party  caused the damage or injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you cannot satisfy claims for injury or damage, all owners of  any interests in, and all affiliates or subsidiaries of any holder of, a  grant or TUP, except for corporate stockholders, are jointly and  severally liable to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If BLM issues a grant or TUP to more than one holder, each is  jointly and severally liable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> By accepting the grant or TUP, you agree to fully indemnify or  hold the United States harmless for liability, damage, or claims arising  in connection with your use and occupancy of the right-of-way or TUP  area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We address liability of state, tribal, and local governments in  Sec. 2886.14 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The provisions of this section do not limit or exclude other  remedies.</p>
