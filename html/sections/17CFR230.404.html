A copy of the  prospectus may be filed as a part of the registration statement in lieu  of furnishing the information in item-and-answer form. Wherever a copy  of the prospectus is filed in lieu of information in item-and-answer  form, the text of the items of the form is to be omitted from the  registration statement, as well as from the prospectus, except to the  extent provided in paragraph (d) of this rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where any items of a form call for information not required to  be included in the prospectus, generally Part II of such form, the text  of such items, including the numbers and captions thereof, together with  the answers thereto shall be filed with the prospectus under cover of  the facing sheet of the form as a part of the registration statement.  However, the text of such items may be omitted provided the answers are  so prepared as to indicate the coverage of the item without the  necessity of reference to the text of the item. If any such item is  inapplicable, or the answer thereto is in the negative, a statement to  that effect shall be made. Any financial statements not required to be  included in the prospectus shall also be filed as a part of the  registration statement proper, unless incorporated by reference pursuant  to Rule 411 (Sec. 230.411).
