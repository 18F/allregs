Accordingly, the notice of opportunity to submit comments referred to in Sec. 2.204(d)(1)(ii) and Sec. 2.205(b), and the list of materials required to be furnished to the EPA legal office under Sec. 2.204(d)(1)(iii), may be modified to reflect the fact that the class determination has made unnecessary the submission of materials pertinent to one or more issues. Moreover, in appropriate cases, action based on the class determination may be taken under Sec. 2.204(b)(1), Sec. 2.204(d), Sec. 2.205(d), or Sec. 2.206. However, the existence of a class determination shall not, of itself, affect any right a business may have to receive any notice under Sec. 2.204(d)(2) or Sec. 2.205(f).</p>
