                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. (1) the color additive D&C; Orange No. 5 is a mixture consisting principally the sodium salt of 4',5'-dibromofluorescein (CAS Reg. No. 596-03-2) and 2',4',5'-tribromofluorescein (CAS Reg. No. 25709-83-5) and 2',4',5',7'-tetrabromofluorescein (CAS Reg. No. 15086-94-9). D&C; Orange No. 5 is manufactured by brominating fluorescein with elemental bromine. The fluorescein is manufactured by the acid condensation of resorcinol and phthalic acid or its anhydride. The fluorescein is isolated and partially purified prior to bromination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> the color additive D&C; Orange No. 5 is a mixture consisting principally the sodium salt of 4',5'-dibromofluorescein (CAS Reg.
