                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands,  except for human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects  and objects of cultural patrimony, remain the property of the Indian  tribe or individual(s) having rights of ownership over such lands.  Ownership and right of control over the disposition of the excepted  items shall be in accordance with the order of priority provided in the  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Pub. L. 101- 601), adapted for the purpose of this rule as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of human remains of Indians and funerary objects, in  the lineal descendants of the Indian; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any case in which such lineal descendants cannot be  ascertained, and in the case of sacred objects and objects of cultural  patrimony:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the Indian tribe on whose tribal lands, or on the individual  Indian lands of whose members, such remains or objects are discovered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the Indian tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the  public lands owned or administered by the BIA on which such remains or  objects are discovered, if upon notice, that tribe states a claim for  those remains or objects; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where it can be so demonstrated by a preponderance of  evidence, in the tribe other than that in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of  this section having the strongest cultural relationship with such  remains or objects, if, upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those  remains or objects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Area Director shall provide the required notice to any  Indian tribe identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this  section, in writing, within 5 working days after such identification has  been documented and confirmed, and shall at the same time submit a copy  of the notice for publication in the Federal Register. This notice shall  include a description of the remains or objects; of where, how, and why  they were excavated or removed; and of the evidence used to identify the  tribe being notified. The remains or objects in question shall be  considered the property of the pertinent tribe under paragraph (a)(2)(i)  of this section or, in the case of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section,  held and administered by the BIA until or unless a claim is stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No permit for the excavation or removal of archaeological  resources on Indian lands may be issued without the written consent of  the Indian landowner(s) either to grant custody of the resources  recovered (other than human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred  objects or objects of cultural patrimony) to a curatorial facility that  meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79 or to allow the permittee a  reasonable period of time to hold or have ready access to them at an  appropriate location for study. The excepted remains and objects are  covered under Sec. 262.5(d) of this part which, in general, permits  their excavation or removal only when the research objectives and  provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis are scientifically  appropriate. Written consent to custody by a curatorial facility may  include terms and conditions regarding curation (e.g., cleaning,  viewing, loaning, studying, etc.), provided these are consistent with 36  CFR part 79.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On lands of Indian tribes, consent must be obtained from the  tribe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On lands of Indian individuals, consent must be obtained from  the owner of the land or the owners of a majority of interests therein,  except as provided in Sec. 262.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where consent is by the owners of a majority of interests, it  must, if the archaeological resources are to be retained by or returned  after study to the interest holders, designate a representative to  receive those resources. Whether and how these are subsequently  distributed among themselves is a matter for the interest holders to  decide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Area Director may, after notifying the tribe (if any) having  jurisdiction over such lands and allowing 15 working days for response,  decline to issue a permit for lands of Indian individuals if he or she  has any verifiable reason to believe that archaeological resources  retained by the landowner(s) after being studied will be sold or  exchanged other than to the tribe having jurisdiction or to a curatorial  facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. The basis for  decline shall be that excavation or removal of resources under such  circumstances would not be in the public interest and would thus be  contrary to the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The landowner(s) alone may grant custody of archaeological  resources (except for human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects  and objects of cultural patrimony, which are subject to the provisions  of paragraph (a) of this section) excavated or removed from lands of  Indian individuals that are under tribal jurisdiction to a curatorial  facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. When, however,  such consignment constitutes the ultimate disposition of these  resources, the tribe having jurisdiction must also grant its consent.  Any subsequent exchange or disposition by the facility   must have the consent of both the landowner(s) and the tribe.</p>
