For this purpose, where the employer  furnishes to an employee a copy of an audiogram with a report thereon,  which indicates the employee has sustained a hearing loss causally  related to factors of that employment, the employer or insurance carrier  shall pay appropriate compensation or at that time controvert the  liability to pay compensation under this Act.
