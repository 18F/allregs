                            <p class="depth0">The appropriate TTB officers are authorized and required to make all  inquiries necessary to the determination and assessment of all taxes  imposed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by  the Bureau. The appropriate TTB officers are further authorized and  required to make the determinations and the assessments of such taxes.  The term ``taxes'' includes interest, additional amounts, additions to  the taxes, and assessable penalties. The authority of the appropriate  TTB officers to make assessment includes the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taxes shown on return. The appropriate TTB officer shall assess  all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the appropriate TTB officer  and disclosed on a return or list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unpaid taxes payable by stamp. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If without use of the proper  stamp:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any article upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of  a stamp is sold or removed for sale or use by the manufacturer thereof,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any transaction or act upon which a tax is required to be paid  by means of a stamp occurs, the appropriate TTB officer, upon such  information as can be obtained, must estimate the amount of the tax  which has not been paid and the appropriate TTB officer must make  assessment therefor upon the person the appropriate TTB officer  determines to be liable for the tax. However, the appropriate TTB  officer may not assess any tax which is payable by stamp unless the  taxpayer fails to pay such tax at the time and in the manner provided by  law or regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a taxpayer gives a check or money order as a payment for  stamps but the check or money order is not paid upon presentment, then  the appropriate TTB officer shall assess the amount of the check or  money order against the taxpayer as if it were a tax due at the time the  check or money order was received by appropriate TTB officer.
