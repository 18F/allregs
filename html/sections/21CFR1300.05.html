                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any term not defined in this part or elsewhere in this chapter  shall have the definition set forth in section 102 of the Act (21 U.S.C.  802).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in part 1317 of this chapter, the following terms shall  have the meanings specified:</p><p class="depth2">Employee means an employee as defined under the general common law  of agency. Some of the factors relevant to the determination of employee  status include: The hiring party's right to control the manner and means  by which the product is accomplished; the skill required; the source of  the instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration  of the relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has  the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent  of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; the  method of payment; the hired party's role in hiring and paying  assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of the  hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of  employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party. Other  applicable factors may be considered and no one factor is dispositive.  The following criteria will determine whether a person is an employee of  a registrant for the purpose of disposal: The person is directly paid by  the registrant; subject to direct oversight by the registrant; required,  as a condition of employment, to follow the registrant's procedures and  guidelines pertaining to the handling of controlled substances; subject  to receive a performance rating or performance evaluation on a regular/ routine basis from the registrant; subject to disciplinary action by the  registrant; and required to render services at the registrant's  registered location.</p><p class="depth2">Law enforcement officer means a person who is described in paragraph  (1), (2) or (3) of this definition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> Employee of either a law enforcement agency, or law enforcement  component of a Federal agency;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> Is under the direction and control of a Federal, State, tribal,  or local government;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> Acting in the course of his/her official duty; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iv)</em> Duly sworn and given the authority by a Federal, State, tribal,  or local government to carry firearms, execute and serve warrants, make  arrests without warrant, and make seizures of property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) police officer  authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in  collection activities conducted by the VHA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> Is a Department of Defense (DOD) police officer authorized by  the DOD to participate in collection activities conducted by the DOD.</p><p class="depth4">Non-retrievable means, for the purpose of destruction, the condition  or state to which a controlled substance shall be rendered following a  process that permanently alters that controlled substance's physical or  chemical condition or state through irreversible means and thereby  renders the controlled substance unavailable and unusable for all  practical purposes. The process to achieve a non-retrievable condition  or state may be unique to a substance's chemical or physical properties.  A controlled substance is considered ``non-retrievable'' when it cannot  be transformed to a physical or chemical condition or state as a  controlled substance or controlled substance analogue. The purpose of  destruction is to render the controlled substance(s) to a non- retrievable state and thus prevent diversion of any such substance to  illicit purposes.</p><p class="depth4">On-site means located on or at the physical premises of the  registrant's registered location. A controlled substance is destroyed  on-site when destruction occurs on the physical premises of the  destroying registrant's registered location. A hospital/clinic has an  on-site pharmacy when it has a pharmacy located on the physical premises  of the registrant's registered location.  [79 FR 53560, Sept. 9, 2014]</p>
