                            <p class="depth0">R[eacute]sum[eacute]s of the principal legislative acts authorizing  transfer of Army and Air Force real property to other Federal  departments are contained in Sec. Sec. 644.402 through 644.408. The  authorities in these acts are exercised independently of GSA  regulations. Transfers under these authorities are made without  reimbursement. Real property can also be transferred under the Federal  Property Act within the scope of disposal authority delegated by GSA.  Transfers under the Federal Property Act are subject to reimbursement as  prescribed by FPMR, section 101-47.203-7. Property reported to GSA for  disposal will be transferred only at the direction of GSA. Excess  property excepted from reporting may be transferred by the DE under GSA  regulations. Transfers to the Department of the Interior of surplus  lands chiefly valuable for migratory bird management are subject to GSA  regulations but are made without reimbursement (Sec. 644.429).</p>
