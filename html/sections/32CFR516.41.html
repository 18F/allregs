                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General Rule. Except as authorized by this subpart, present or  former DA personnel will not disclose official information (See appendix  F--Glossary)   in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Present or former DA personnel may disclose official  information if they obtain the written approval of the appropriate SJA,  legal adviser, or Litigation Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Referral to deciding official. If present or former DA personnel  receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or  quasi-judicial proceeding, or request for an interview related to actual  or potential litigation, and it appears the subpoena, order, or request  seeks disclosures described in a above, the individual should  immediately advise the appropriate SJA or legal adviser. If the SJA or  legal adviser cannot informally satisfy the subpoena, order, or request  in accordance with Sec. Sec. 516.43 through 516.50 of this subpart, he  should consult with Litigation Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requesters' responsibilities. Individuals seeking official  information must submit, at least 14 days before the desired date of  production, a specific written request setting forth the nature and  relevance of the official information sought. (Requesters can be  referred to this subpart G). Subject to Sec. 516.47(a), present and  former DA personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon,  or testify concerning those matters specified in writing and properly  approved by the SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. (See United  States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Litigation in which the United States has an interest. If a  subpoena, order, or request relates to litigation in which the United  States has an interest and for which litigation responsibility has not  been delegated, the SJA or legal adviser will coordinate with Litigation  Division under Sec. 516.42.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Motions to stay or quash subpoenas. A subpoena should never be  ignored, and an SJA or legal adviser should seek assistance from  Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney's office whenever necessary. If  a response to a subpoena or order is required before a release  determination can be made or before Litigation Division or the U.S.  Attorney can be contacted, the SJA or legal adviser will do the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Furnish the court or tribunal a copy of this regulation (32 CFR  part 516, subpart G) and applicable case law (See United States ex. rel.  Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform the court or tribunal that the requesting individual has  not complied with this Chapter, as set out in 32 CFR 97 & 516, or that  the subpoena or order is being reviewed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seek to stay the subpoena or order pending the requestor's  compliance with this chapter or final determination by Litigation  Division; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the court or other tribunal declines to quash or stay the  subpoena or order, inform Litigation Division immediately so a decision  can be made whether to challenge the subpoena or order. If Litigation  Division decides not to challenge the subpoena or order, the affected  personnel will comply with the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division  decides to challenge the subpoena or order, it will direct the affected  personnel to respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order.  (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Classified or sensitive information. Only Litigation Division  may authorize the release of official information or appearance of DA  personnel as witnesses in litigation involving terrorism, espionage,  nuclear weapons, or intelligence sources and methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Requests for Inspector General records or testimony. IG records,  and information obtained through performance of IG duties, are official  information under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Army.  (See AR 20-l, Chapter 3.) IG records frequently contain sensitive  official information that may be classified or obtained under guarantees  of confidentiality. When justification exists, DA attorneys will seek  court protection from disclosure of IG records and information. No DA  personnel will release IG records or disclose information obtained  through performance of IG duties without the approval of The Secretary  of the Army, The Inspector General, TIG Legal Advisor, or Chief,  Litigation Division. When IG personnel receive a subpoena, court order,  request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or a  request for an interview which the IG   reasonably believes is related to actual or potential litigation  concerning IG records or related information, they should immediately  notify the Inspector General Legal Adviser or the Chief, Litigation  Division. IG personnel will follow the guidance of this subpart  concerning actions to be taken regarding disclosure and testimony.</p>
