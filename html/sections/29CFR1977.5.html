                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All employees are afforded the full protection of section 11(c).  For purposes of the Act, an employee is defined as ``an employee of an  employer who is employed in a business of his employer which affects  commerce.'' The Act does not define the term ``employ.'' However, the  broad remedial nature of this legislation demonstrates a clear  congressional intent that the existence of an employment relationship,  for purposes of section 11(c), is to be based upon economic realities  rather than upon common law doctrines and concepts. See, U.S. v. Silk,  331 U.S. 704 (1947); Rutherford Food Corporation v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722  (1947).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of section 11(c), even an applicant for employment  could be considered an employee. See, NLRB v. Lamar Creamery, 246 F. 2d  8 (5th Cir., 1957). Further, because section 11(c) speaks in terms of  any employee, it is also clear that the employee need not be an employee  of the discriminator. The principal consideration would be whether the  person alleging discrimination was an ``employee'' at the time of  engaging in protected activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p>
