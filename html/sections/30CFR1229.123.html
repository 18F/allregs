                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All audit activities performed under a delegation of authority must be in accordance with the ``Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions'' as issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following audit standards also shall apply to all audit work performed under a delegation of authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General standards--(i) Qualifications. The auditors assigned to perform the audit must collectively possess adequate professional proficiency for the tasks required, including a knowledge of accounting, auditing, agency regulations, and industry operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Qualifications. The auditors assigned to perform the audit must collectively possess adequate professional proficiency for the tasks required, including a knowledge of accounting, auditing, agency regulations, and industry operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Independence. In all matters relating to the audit work, the audit organization and the individual auditors must be free from personal or external impairments to independence and shall maintain an independent attitude and appearance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Due professional care. Due professional care is to be used in conducting the audit and in preparing related reports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Quality control. The State governments must institute quality control review procedures to ensure that all audits are performed in conformity with the standards established herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examination and evaluation standards--Standards and requirements for examination and evaluation. Auditors should be alert to situations or transactions that could be indicative of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts with respect to the program. If such evidence exists, auditors should forward this evidence to ONRR. The ONRR will contact the appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies. The scope of examinations are to be governed by the principle of a justifiable relationship between cost and benefit as determined by the auditor or audit supervisor. Audit procedures should reflect the most efficient method of obtaining the requisite degree of satisfaction. The auditor should determine, to the extent possible, the effect on royalty reporting of the non-arms'-length nature of related party transactions, such as transfers of oil to refinery units affiliated with the producer. A review should be made of compliance with the appropriate laws and regulations applicable to program operations. ONRR shall issue guidelines as to the definition and nature of arms'-length and non-arms'-length transactions for use in carrying out delegated audit activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standards of reporting. (i) Written audit reports are to be submitted to the appropriate ONRR officials at the end of each field examination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Written audit reports are to be submitted to the appropriate ONRR officials at the end of each field examination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement in the auditors' report that the examination was made in accordance with the generally accepted program audit standards (including the applicable General Accounting Office (GAO) standards) for royalty compliance audits should be in the appropriate language to indicate that the audit was made in accordance with this statement of standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The auditor's report should contain a statement of positive assurance on those items tested and negative assurance on those items not tested. It should also include all instances of noncompliance and instances or indications of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts found during or in connection with the audit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The auditor's report should contain any other material deficiency identified during the audit not covered in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When factors external to the program and to the auditor restrict the audit or interfere with the auditor's ability to form objective opinions and conclusions (such as denial of access to information by a company), the auditor is to notify the ONRR. If the limitation is not removed, a description of the matter must be included in the auditor's report. ONRR will take all legally enforceable steps necessary to seek information necessary to complete the audit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If certain information is prohibited from general disclosure, the auditor's report should state the nature of the information omitted and the requirement that makes the omission necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Written audit reports are to be prepared in the format prescribed by the ONRR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> In instances where the extent of the audit findings or the amounts involved do not warrant it, a formal audit report need not be issued. In lieu of an audit report, a memorandum of audit findings will be prepared and placed on the case file.
