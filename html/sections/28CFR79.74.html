                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Representation. In submitting and presenting a claim to the  Program, a claimant or beneficiary may, but need not, be represented by  an attorney or by a representative of an Indian Tribe or tribal  organization. Non-attorneys (other than representatives of an Indian  Tribe or tribal organization) are not permitted to represent claimants  or beneficiaries before the Program. To the extent that resources are  available, the Assistant Director will provide assistance to all persons  who file claims for compensation. Only qualified attorneys, as described  in paragraph (c) of this section, may receive from a claimant or  beneficiary any fee in connection with a successful claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any contract, the attorney of a  claimant or beneficiary, along with any assistants or experts retained  by the attorney on behalf of the claimant or beneficiary, may not  receive from a claimant or beneficiary any fee for services rendered in  connection with an unsuccessful claim. The attorney of a claimant or  beneficiary may recover costs incurred in connection with an  unsuccessful claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any contract and except as provided in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, the attorney of a claimant or beneficiary, along  with any assistants or experts retained by the attorney on behalf of the  claimant or beneficiary, may receive from a claimant or beneficiary no  more than 2% of the total award for all services rendered in connection  with a successful claim, exclusive of costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an attorney entered into a contract with the claimant or  beneficiary for services before July 10, 2000, with respect to a  particular claim, then that attorney may receive up to 10% of the total  award for services rendered in connection with a successful claim,  exclusive of costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an attorney resubmits a previously denied claim, then that  attorney may receive up to 10% of the total award to the claimant or  beneficiary for services rendered in connection   with that subsequently successful claim, exclusive of costs.  Resubmission of a previously denied claim includes only those claims  that were previously denied and refiled under the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any violation of paragraph (b) of this section shall result in a  fine of not more than $5,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attorney qualifications. An attorney may not represent a  claimant or beneficiary unless the attorney is engaged in the private  practice of law and an active member in good standing of the bar of the  highest court of a state. Attorneys who are members of multiple state  bars, and who are suspended, sanctioned, disbarred, or disqualified from  the practice of law for professional misconduct in one state may not  represent a claimant or beneficiary even though the attorney continues  to remain in good standing of the bar of another state. If a claimant or  beneficiary is represented by an attorney, then the attorney must submit  the following documents to the Program along with the claim:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the attorney's active membership in good standing  of the bar of the highest court of a state; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A signed representation agreement, retainer agreement, fee  agreement, or contract, documenting the attorney's authorization to  represent the claimant or beneficiary. The document must acknowledge  that the Act's fee limitations are satisfied.  [Order No. 2711-2004, 69 FR 13634, Mar. 23, 2004, as amended by Order  3185-2010, 75 FR 48275, Aug. 10, 2010]</p>
