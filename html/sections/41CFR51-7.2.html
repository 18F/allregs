Pursuant to the JWOD Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c), the Committee for Purchase  from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled makes the determination  as to which qualified nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or  have other severe disabilities will furnish designated products and  services to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect  to these actions, the Committee staff shall consult as required with  other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary  environmental analysis. The Executive Director shall determine on the  basis of information submitted by private agencies and other non-Federal  entities or generated by the Committee whether the proposed action is  one that normally does not require an environmental assessment or  environmental impact statement (EIS) as set forth in Sec. 51-7.4, or is  one that requires an environmental assessment as set forth in 40 CFR  1501.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To facilitate compliance with these requirements, private  agencies and other non-Federal entities are expected to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contact the Committee staff as early as possible in the planning  process for guidance on the scope and level of environmental information  required to be submitted in support of their request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate  by the Committee to determine the impact of the proposed action on the  human environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local  agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary  planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local  approvals as early as possible in the planning process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notify the Committee as early as possible of all other Federal,  regional, State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project  completion so that the Committee may coordinate all Federal  environmental reviews; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notify the Committee of all known parties potentially affected  by or interested in the proposed action.
