                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the elements required by Sec. 60-2.10 through Sec. 60-2.16, an acceptable affirmative action program must include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designation of responsibility. The contractor must provide for the implementation of equal employment opportunity and the affirmative action program by assigning responsibility and accountability to an official of the organization. Depending upon the size of the contractor, this may be the official's sole responsibility. He or she must have the authority, resources, support of and access to top management to ensure the effective implementation of the affirmative action program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification of problem areas. The contractor must perform in-depth analyses of its total employment process to determine whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. At a minimum the contractor must evaluate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The workforce by organizational unit and job group to determine whether there are problems of minority or female utilization (i.e., employment in the unit or group), or of minority or female distribution (i.e., placement in the different jobs within the unit or group);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personnel activity (applicant flow, hires, terminations, promotions, and other personnel actions) to determine whether there are selection disparities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compensation system(s) to determine whether there are gender-, race-, or ethnicity-based disparities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Selection, recruitment, referral, and other personnel procedures to determine whether they result in disparities in the employment or advancement of minorities or women; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other areas that might impact the success of the affirmative action program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action-oriented programs. The contractor must develop and execute action-oriented programs designed to correct any problem areas identified pursuant to Sec. 60-2.17(b) and to attain established goals and objectives. In order for these action-oriented programs to be effective, the contractor must ensure that they consist of more than following the same procedures which have previously produced inadequate results. Furthermore, a contractor must demonstrate that it has made good faith efforts to remove identified barriers, expand employment opportunities, and produce measurable results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Internal audit and reporting system. The contractor must develop and implement an auditing system that periodically measures the effectiveness of its total affirmative action program. The actions listed below are key to a successful affirmative action program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitor records of all personnel activity, including referrals, placements, transfers, promotions, terminations, and compensation, at all levels to ensure the nondiscriminatory policy is carried out;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require internal reporting on a scheduled basis as to the degree to which equal employment opportunity and organizational objectives are attained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review report results with all levels of management; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advise top management of program effectiveness and submit recommendations to improve unsatisfactory performance.
