                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes general rules pertaining to the verification of the statements of account by interested parties according to terms promulgated by a duly appointed copyright arbitration royalty panel, under its authority to set reasonable terms and rates pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 114 and 801(b)(1), and the Librarian of Congress under his authority pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 802(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of verification. Interested parties may conduct a single audit of a nonexempt preexisting subscription service during any given calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of intent to audit. Interested parties must submit a notice of intent to audit a particular service with the Copyright Office, which shall publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing the receipt of the notice of intent to audit within 30 days of the filing of the interested parties' notice. Such notification of intent to audit shall also be served at the same time on the party to be audited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of records. The party requesting the verification procedure shall retain the report of the verification for a period of three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acceptable verification procedure. An audit, including underlying paperwork, which was performed in the ordinary course of business according to generally accepted auditing standards by an independent auditor, shall serve as an acceptable verification procedure for all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Costs of the verification procedure. The interested parties requesting the verification procedure shall pay for the cost of the verification procedure, unless an independent auditor concludes that there was an underpayment of five (5) percent or more; in which case, the service which made the underpayment shall bear the costs of the verification procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interested parties. For purposes of this section, interested parties are those copyright owners who are entitled to receive royalty fees pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 114(g), their designated agents, or the entity designated by the copyright arbitration royalty panel in 37 CFR 260.3 to receive and to distribute the royalty fees.
