The plan must be submitted to the Administrator for approval at least 90 days before the correlation test is scheduled to be conducted. The plan must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of test conditions and the number of runs for each test condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The target particulate matter emission level for each test condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> How the operation of the affected source will be modified to attain the desired particulate matter emission rate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The anticipated normal particulate matter emission level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will review and approve or disapprove the correlation test plan in accordance with Sec.  63.7(c)(3)(i) and (iii).

than 96 hours, in the aggregate, for the purposes of conducting tests to correlate PM CEMS with manual method test results, including all runs and conditions, except as described in this paragraph. Where additional time is required to correlate a PM CEMS device, a source may petition the Administrator for an extension of the 96-hour aggregate waiver of compliance with the PM and opacity standards. An extension of the 96-hour aggregate waiver is renewable at the discretion of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator must return the affected source to operating conditions indicative of compliance with the applicable particulate matter and opacity standards as soon as possible after correlation testing is completed.[64 FR 31925, June 14, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 16622, Apr. 5, 2002; 78 FR 10054, Feb. 12, 2013]</p>
