                                Sec. 35.2140  User charge system.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The user charge system (see Secs. 35.2122 and 35.2208) must be  designed to produce adequate revenues required for operation and  maintenance (including replacement). It shall provide that each user  which discharges pollutants that cause an increase in the cost of  managing the effluent or sludge from the treatment works shall pay for  such increased cost. The user charge system shall be based on either  actual use under paragraph (a) of this section, ad valorem taxes under  paragraph (b) of this section, or a combination of the two.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> User charge system based on actual use. A grantee's user charge  system based on actual use (or estimated use) of wastewater treatment  services shall provide that each user (or user class) pays its  proportionate share of operation and maintenance (including replacement)  costs of treatment works within the grantee's service area, based on the  user's proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from  all users (or user classes).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> User charge system based on ad valorem taxes. A grantee's user  charge system which is based on ad valorem taxes may be approved if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On December 27, 1977, the grantee had in existence a system of  dedicated ad valorem taxes which collected revenues to pay the cost of  operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment works within the  grantee's service area and the grantee has continued to use that system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ad valorem user charge system distributes the operation and  maintenance (including replacement) costs for all treatment works in the  grantee's jurisdiction to the residential and small non-residential user  class (including at the grantee's option nonresidential, commercial and  industrial users that introduce no more than the equivalent of 25,000  gallons per day of domestic sanitary wastes to the treatment works), in  proportion to the use of the treatment works by this class; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each member of the industrial user and commercial user class  which discharges more than 25,000 gallons per day of sanitary waste pays  its share of the costs of operation and maintenance (including  replacement) of the treatment works based upon charges for actual use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. Each user charge system must provide that each  user be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill  (or other means acceptable to the Regional Administrator), of the rate  and that portion of the user charges or ad valorem taxes which are  attributable to wastewater treatment services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financial management system. Each user charge system must  include an adequate financial management system that will accurately  account for revenues generated by the system and expenditures for  operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the treatment  system, based on an adequate budget identifying the basis for  determining the annual operation and maintenance costs and the costs of  personnel, material, energy and administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Charges for operation and maintenance for extraneous flows. The  user charge system shall provide that the costs of operation and  maintenance for all flow not directly attributable to users (i.e.,  infiltration/inflow) be distributed among all users based upon either of  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the same manner that it distributes the costs for their  actual use, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under a system which uses one or any combination of the  following factors on a reasonable basis:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow volume of the users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Land area of the users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number of hookups or discharges of the users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Property valuation of the users, if the grantee has an approved  user charge system based on ad valorem taxes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After completion of building a project, revenue from the project  (e.g., sale of a treatment-related by-product; lease of the land; or  sale of crops grown on the land purchased under the grant agreement)  shall be used to offset the costs of operation and maintenance.   The grantee shall proportionately reduce all user charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Adoption of system. One or more municipal legislative enactments  or other appropriate authority must incorporate the user charge system.  If the project accepts wastewater from other municipalities, the  subscribers receiving waste treatment services from the grantee shall  adopt user charge systems in accordance with this section. These user  charge systems shall also be incorporated in appropriate municipal  legislative enactments or other appropriate authority of all  municipalities contributing wastes to the treatment works.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Inconsistent agreements. The user charge system shall take  precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts which  are inconsistent with the requirements of section 204(b)(1)(A) of the  Act and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Low income residential user rates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grantees may establish  lower user charge rates for low income residential users after providing  for public notice and hearing. A low income residential user is any  residence with a household income below the Federal poverty level as  defined in 45 CFR 1060.2 or any residence designated as low income under  State law or regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any lower user charge rate for low income residential users must  be defined as a uniform percentage of the user charge rate charged other  residential users.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The costs of any user charge reductions afforded a low income  residential class must be proportionately absorbed by all other user  classes. The total revenue for operation and maintenance (including  equipment replacement) of the facilities must not be reduced as a result  of establishing a low income residential user class.
