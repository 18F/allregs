                            <p class="depth0">Any party may file a posthearing brief. The presiding officer shall fix the time for filing such briefs (which shall be filed simultaneously), which shall not exceed 60 days from the date the parties received the transcript of the hearing or, if applicable, the stipulated record. Such briefs may be accompanied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The presiding officer may permit the parties to file responsive briefs. No brief may exceed 30 pages (exclusive of proposed findings and conclusions) unless the presiding officer has previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so complex, or the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify longer briefs, in which case the presiding officer may

set a longer page limit. Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law shall not exceed 30 pages unless the presiding officer has previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so complex, or the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify longer proposed findings and conclusions, in which case the presiding officer may set a longer page limit.</p>
