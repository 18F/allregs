Also, an action significantly affects the  environment if it does significant harm to the environment even though  on balance the action may be beneficial to the environment. To the  extent applicable, the responsible official shall address the  considerations set forth in the CEQ regulations under 40 CFR 1508.27 in  determining significant effect.</p>
