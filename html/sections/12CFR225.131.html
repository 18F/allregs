                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, which adds bank management consulting advice to the list  of closely related activities, described in general terms the nature of  such activity. This interpretation is intended to explain in greater  detail certain of the terms in the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is expected that bank management consulting advice would  include, but not be limited to, advice concerning: Bank operations,  systems and procedures; computer operations and mechanization;  implementation of electronic funds transfer systems; site planning and  evaluation; bank mergers and the establishment of new branches;  operation and management of a trust department; international banking;  foreign exchange transactions; purchasing policies and practices; cost  analysis, capital adequacy and planning; auditing; accounting  procedures; tax planning; investment advice (as authorized in  Sec. 225.4(a)(5)); credit policies and administration, including credit  documentation, evaluation, and debt collection; product development,  including specialized lending provisions; marketing operations,  including research, market development and advertising programs;  personnel operations,   including recruiting, training, evaluation and compensation; and  security measures and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In permitting bank holding companies to provide management  consulting advice to nonaffiliated ``banks'', the Board intends such  advice to be given only to an institution that both accepts deposits  that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand and engages  in the business of making commercial loans. It is also intended that  such management consulting advice may be provided to the ``operations  subsidiaries'' of a bank, since such subsidiaries perform functions that  a bank is empowered to perform directly at locations at which the bank  is authorized to engage in business (Sec. 250.141 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Although a bank holding company providing management consulting  advice is prohibited by the regulation from owning or controlling,  directly or indirectly, any equity securities in a client bank, this  limitation does not apply to shares of a client bank acquired, directly  or indirectly, as a result of a default on a debt previously contracted.  This limitation is also inapplicable to shares of a client bank acquired  by a bank holding company, directly or indirectly, in a fiduciary  capacity: Provided, That the bank holding company or its subsidiary does  not have sole discretionary authority to vote such shares or shares held  with sole voting rights constitute not more than five percent of the  outstanding voting shares of a client bank.
