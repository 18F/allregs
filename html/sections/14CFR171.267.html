                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ISMLS glide path equipment must provide an automatic monitor  system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control  points when any of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A shift of the mean ISMLS glide path angle equivalent to more  than 0.075[thetas].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For glide paths in which the basic functions are provided by the  use of a single frequency system, a reduction of power output to less  than 50 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A change of the angle between the glide path and the line below  the glide path (150 Hz predominating), at which a DDM of 0.0875 is  realized by more than 0.0375[thetas].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lowering of the line beneath the ISMLS glide path at which a DDM  of 0.0875 is realized to less than 0.75[thetas] from the horizontal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure of any part of the monitor itself. Such failure must  automatically produce the same results as the malfunctioning of the  element being monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At glide path facilities where the selected nominal angular  displacement sensitivity corresponds to an angle below the ISMLS glide  path, which is close to or at the maximum limits specified, an  adjustment to the monitor operating limits may be made to protect  against sector deviations below 0.75[thetas] from the horizontal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 10 seconds of the occurrence of any of the conditions  prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, including periods of zero  radiation, glide path signal radiation must cease.</p>
