                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The determination of eligibility of units of general local  government to receive entitlement grants, the entitlement amounts, the  allocation of appropriated funds to States for use in nonentitlement  areas, the reallocation of funds, the allocation of appropriated funds  to insular areas, and the allocation of appropriated funds for  discretionary grants under the Secretary's Fund shall be governed by the  policies and procedures described in sections 106 and 107 of the Act, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The definitions in Sec.  570.3 shall govern in applying the  policies and procedures described in sections 106 and 107 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining eligibility for entitlement and in allocating  funds under section 106 of the Act for any federal fiscal year, HUD will  recognize corporate status and geographical boundaries and the status of  metropolitan areas and principal cities effective as of July 1 preceding  such federal fiscal year, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to corporate status as certified by the applicable  State and available for processing by the Census Bureau as of such date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to boundary changes or annexations, as are used by  the Census Bureau in preparing population estimates for all general  purpose governmental units and are available for processing by the  Census Bureau as of such date, except that any such boundary changes or  annexations which result in the population of a unit of general local  government reaching or exceeding 50,000 shall be recognized for this  purpose whether or not such changes are used by the Census Bureau in  preparing such population estimates; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to the status of Metropolitan Statistical Areas and  principal cities, as officially designated by the Office of Management  and Budget as of such date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In determining whether a county qualifies as an urban county,  and in computing entitlement amounts for urban counties, the demographic  values of population, poverty, housing overcrowding, and age of housing  of any Indian tribes located within the county shall be excluded. In  allocating amounts to States for use in nonentitlement areas, the  demographic values of population, poverty, housing overcrowding and age  of housing of all Indian tribes located in all nonentitled areas shall  be excluded. It is recognized that all such data on Indian tribes are  not generally available from the United States Bureau of the Census and  that missing portions of data will have to be estimated. In  accomplishing any such estimates the Secretary may use such other  related information available from reputable sources as may seem  appropriate, regardless of the data's point or period of time and shall  use the best judgement possible in adjusting such data to reflect the  same point or period of time as the overall data from which the Indian  tribes are being deducted, so that such deduction shall not create an  imbalance with those overall data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amounts remaining after closeout of a grant which are required  to be returned to HUD under the provisions of Sec.  570.509, Grant  closeout procedures, shall be considered as funds available for  reallocation unless the appropriation under which the funds were  provided to the Department has lapsed.
