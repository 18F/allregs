                            <p class="depth0">EPA may test a detergent to confirm that the required performance levels are met. Based on the findings of this confirmatory testing, a detergent certification may be denied or revoked under the provisions of Sec. 80.161(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the national, PADD, or fuel-specific options under Sec. Sec. 80.163(a)(1) and 80.163(b) through (d) will generally entail a single vehicle test using the procedures detailed in Sec. 80.165. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the

minimum levels specified in Sec. 80.164, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein. Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the alternative national generic certification option in Sec. 80.163(a)(1)(iii) will generally entail a single test using the procedures detailed in Sec. 80.177. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the minimum levels specified in Sec. 80.177, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Confirmatory certification testing conducted to evaluate the validity of CARB-based detergent certifications will use the subject detergent in test fuel(s) containing the relevant fuel parameters at levels no greater than the maximum levels for which the CARB certification was granted. The test procedures will be conducted pursuant to the procedures specified under section 2257 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of registration and certification information specific to detergent use in leaded gasoline will use the subject detergent in a test fuel containing the test fuel parameters at levels no greater than those prescribed in Sec. 80.164. EPA will make all reasonable efforts to use the same test procedure for confirmatory testing purposes as was used by the certifier in conducting deposit control performance testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When EPA decides to conduct confirmatory testing on a fuel or additive which is not readily available in the open market, EPA may request that the detergent certifier and/or manufacturer of such fuel or additive furnish a sample in the needed quantity. If testing is conducted to evaluate the validity of a detergent certification under the fuel-specific option, the detergent blender must supply EPA with test fuel, or with blend stocks with which to formulate such test fuel, in sufficient quantity to conduct the specified deposit control performance testing. The fuel or additive manufacturer shall comply with a sample request made pursuant to this paragraph within 30 days of receipt of the request.
