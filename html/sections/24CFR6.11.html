To the extent practicable, the Responsible Official will notify the complainant and the Recipient of the Responsible Official's receipt of a complaint within 10 calendar days of receipt of a complete complaint. If the Responsible Official receives a complaint that is not complete, the Responsible Official will notify the complainant and specify the additional information that is needed to make the complaint complete. If the complainant fails to complete the complaint, the Responsible Official will close the complaint without prejudice and notify the complainant. When a complete complaint has been received, the Responsible Official, or his or her designee, will assess the complaint for acceptance, rejection, or referral to an appropriate Federal agency within 20 calendar days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Resolution of complaints. After the acceptance of a complete complaint, the Responsible Official will investigate the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and, if resolution is not achieved, the Responsible Official will notify the Recipient and complainant, to the extent practicable within 180 days of the receipt of the complete complaint, of the results of the investigation in a letter of findings sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, containing the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Findings of fact and a finding of compliance or noncompliance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of an appropriate remedy for each violation believed to exist; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A notice of the right of the Recipient and the complainant to request a review of the letter of findings by the Responsible Official.

Parties other than the party requesting review and HUD shall have 20 days from receipt to respond to the request for review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Responsible Official will either sustain or modify the letter of findings or require that further investigation be conducted, within 60 days of the request for review. The Responsible Official's decision shall constitute the formal determination of compliance or noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If no party requests that the letter of findings be reviewed, the Responsible Official, within 14 calendar days of the expiration of the time period in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, will send a formal written determination of compliance or noncompliance to all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voluntary compliance time limits. The Recipient will have 10 calendar days from receipt of the letter of findings of noncompliance, or such other reasonable time as specified in the letter, within which to agree, in writing, to come into voluntary compliance or to contact the Responsible Official for settlement discussions. If the Recipient fails to meet this deadline, HUD will proceed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 6.12 and 6.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Informal resolution/voluntary compliance--(1) General. It is the policy of HUD to encourage the informal resolution of matters. A complaint or a compliance review may be resolved by informal means at any time.

If a letter of findings is issued, and the letter makes a finding of noncompliance, the Responsible Official will attempt to resolve the matter through a voluntary compliance agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objectives of informal resolution/voluntary compliance. In attempting informal resolution, the Responsible Official will attempt to achieve a just resolution of the matter and to obtain assurances, where appropriate, that the Recipient will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of any

complainant, and will take such action as will assure the elimination of any violation of this part or the prevention of the occurrence of such violation in the future. If a finding of noncompliance has been made, the terms of such an informal resolution shall be reduced to a written voluntary compliance agreement, signed by the Recipient and the Responsible Official, and be made part of the file. Such voluntary compliance agreements shall seek to protect the interests of the complainant (if any), other persons similarly situated, and the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Right to file a private civil action. At any time in the process, the complainant has the right to file a private civil action. If the complainant does so, the Responsible Official has the discretion to administratively close the investigation or continue the investigation, if he or she decides that it is in the best interests of the Department to do so. If the Responsible Official makes a finding of noncompliance and an agreement to voluntarily comply is not obtained from the Recipient, the procedures at Sec. Sec. 6.12 and 6.13 for effecting compliance shall be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No Recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding, or hearing under this part.</p>
