                                Sec. 784.141  Examples of nonexempt employees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An employer who engaged in operations specified in section 13(b)(4)  which he performs on the marine products and byproducts described in  that section may operate a business which engages also in operations of  a different character or one in which some of the activities carried on  are not functionally necessary to the conduct of operations named in  section 13(b)(4). In such a business there will ordinarily be, in  addition to the employees employed in such named operations, other  employees who are nonexempt because their work is concerned entirely or  in substantial part with carrying on activities which constitute neither  the actual engagement in the named operations nor the performance of  functions which are, as a practical matter, directly and necessarily a  part of their employer's conduct of such named operations. Ordinarily,  as indicated in Sec. 784.156, such nonexempt employees will not be  employed in an establishment which is exclusively devoted by the  employer to the named operations during the period of their employment.  It is usually when the named operations are not being carried on, or in  places wholly or partly devoted to other operations, that employees of  such an employer will be performing functions which are not so  necessarily related to the conduct of the operations named in section  13(b)(4) as to come within the exemption. Typical illustrations of the  occupations in which such nonexempt workers may be found   (although employment in such an occupation does not necessarily mean  that the worker is nonexempt) are the following: General office work  (such as maintaining employment, social security, payroll and other  records, handling general correspondence, etc., as distinguished from  ``marketing'' or ``distributing'' work like that described in Sec.  784.155), custodial, maintenance, watching, and guarding occupations;  furnishing food, lodging, transportation, or nursing services to  workers; and laboratory occupations such as those concerned with  development of new products. Such workers are, of course, not physically  engaged in operations named in section 13(b)(4) in the ordinary case,  and they are not exempt unless they can be shown to be ``employed in''  such operations on other grounds. But any of them may come within the  exemption in a situation where the employer can show that the functions  which they perform, in view of all the facts and circumstances under  which the named operations are carried on, are actually so integrated  with or essential to the conduct of the named operations as to be, in  practical effect directly and necessarily a part of the operations for  which exemption was intended. Thus, for example, if canning operations  described in section 13(b)(4) are carried on in a location where the  canning employees cannot obtain necessary food unless the canner  provides it, his employment of culinary employees to provide such food  is functionally so necessary to the conduct of the canning operations  that their work is, as a practical matter, a part of such operations,  and the exemption will apply to them. On like principle, the exemption  may apply to a watchman whose services are required during performance  of the named operations in order to guard against spontaneous combustion  of the products of such operations and other occurrences which may  jeopardize the conduct of the operations.</p><p class="depth0">``Canning''</p>
