Where two or more different claims for relief are  presented, or where multiple parties are involved, in a proceeding  forwarded pursuant to Sec. 12.26 (b) or (c) of these rules, the  Judgment Officer or Administrative Law Judge, may upon his own motion or  by motion of a party, direct that an initial decision or other order  disposing of one or more, but fewer than all of the claims or parties,  shall be final and immediately appealable to the Commission. Such a  direction may be made only upon an express determination that there is  no just reason for delay. When such a direction is made, a party may  appeal the initial decision or order in accordance with the procedure  prescribed by Sec. 12.401 of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When decision is not appealable. In the absence of such a  direction by the Judgment Officer or an Administrative Law Judge, an  initial decision or order disposing of fewer than all of the claims or  all of the parties shall be subject to revision by the decisionmaker at  any time before a disposition is made of all remaining claims or  parties, and no appeal may be taken to the Commission pursuant to this  rule.</p>
