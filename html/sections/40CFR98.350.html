This source category consists of the following: anaerobic reactors, anaerobic lagoons, anaerobic sludge digesters, and biogas destruction devices (for example, burners, boilers, turbines, flares, or other devices).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An anaerobic reactor is an enclosed vessel used for anaerobic wastewater treatment (e.g., upflow anaerobic sludge blanket, fixed film).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ananaerobic sludge digester is an enclosed vessel in which wastewater treatment sludge is degraded anaerobically.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ananaerobic lagoon is a lined or unlined earthen basin used for wastewater treatment, in which oxygen is absent throughout the depth of the basin, except for a shallow surface zone. Anaerobic lagoons are not equipped with surface aerators. Anaerobic lagoons are classified as deep (depth more than 2 meters) or shallow (depth less than 2 meters).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This source category does not include municipal wastewater treatment plants or separate treatment of sanitary wastewater at industrial sites.
