                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A vehicle or equipment item which has entered the United States  under a declaration made pursuant to Sec. 591.5(j), and for which a  Temporary Importation Bond has been provided to the Secretary of the  Treasury, shall not remain in the United States for a period that  exceeds 3 years from its date of entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the importer of a vehicle or equipment item under Sec.  591.5(j) does not intend to export or destroy the vehicle or equipment  item not later than 3 years after the date of entry, and intends to pay  duty to the U.S. Customs Service on such vehicle or equipment item, the  importer shall request permission in writing from the Administrator for  the vehicle or equipment item to remain in the United States for an  additional period of time not to exceed 5 years from the date of entry.  Such a request must be received not later than 60 days before the date  that is 3 years after the date of entry. Such vehicle or equipment item  shall not remain in the United States for a period that exceeds 5 years  from the date of entry, unless further written permission has been  obtained from the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States  under a   declaration made pursuant to Sec. 591.5(j)(2)(i) shall not sell, or  transfer possession of, or title to, the vehicle, and shall not license  it for use, or operate it on the public roads, except under such terms  and conditions as the Administrator may authorize in writing. An  importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States under a  declaration made pursuant to Sec. 591.5(j)(2)(ii) shall at all times  retain title to it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any violation of a term or condition imposed by the  Administrator in a letter authorizing importation for on-road use under  Sec. 591.5(j), or a change of status under paragraph (e) of this  section, including a failure to allow inspection upon request to verify  that the accumulated mileage of the vehicle is not more than 2,500 miles  in any 12-month period, shall be considered a violation of 49 U.S.C.  30112(a) for which a civil penalty may be imposed. Such a violation will  also act to void the authorization and require the exportation of the  vehicle. With respect to importations under Sec. 591.6(f)(2) or a  change of status to an importation for show or display as provided under  paragraph (e) of this section, if the Administrator has reason to  believe that a violation has occurred, the Administrator may tentatively  conclude that a term of entry has been violated, but shall make no final  conclusion until the importer or owner has been afforded an opportunity  to present data, views, and arguments as to why there is no violation or  why a penalty should not be imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the importer of a vehicle under Sec. 591.5(f)(2)(ii) has  been notified in writing by the Registered Importer with which it has  executed a contract or other agreement that the registration of the  Registered Importer has been suspended (for other than the first time)  or revoked, pursuant to Sec. 592.7 of this chapter, and that it has not  affixed a certification label on the vehicle and/or filed a  certification of conformance with the Administrator as required by Sec.  592.6 of this chapter, and that it therefore may not release the vehicle  for the importer, the importer shall execute a contract or other  agreement with another Registered Importer for the certification of the  vehicle and submission of the certification of conformance to the  Administrator. The Administrator shall toll the 120-day period for  submission of a certification to the Administrator pursuant to Sec.  592.6(d) of this chapter during the period from the date of the  Registered Importer's notification to the importer until the date of the  contract with the substitute Registered Importer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a vehicle has entered the United States under a declaration  made pursuant to Sec. 591.5(l) and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Administrator of NHTSA dismisses the petition or decides  that the vehicle is not eligible for importation, or if the importer  withdraws the petition or fails to submit a petition covering the  vehicle within 180 days from the date of entry, the importer must  deliver the vehicle, unless it is destroyed (with destruction documented  by proof), to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export, or abandon  the vehicle to the United States, within 30 days from the date of the  dismissal, denial, or withdrawal of the importer's petition, as  appropriate, or within 210 days from the date of entry if the importer  fails to submit a petition covering the vehicle, and furnish NHTSA with  documentary proof of the vehicle's exportation, abandonment, or  destruction within 15 days from the date of such action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator grants the petition, the importer must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furnish a bond, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the entered  value of the vehicle as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,  within 15 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition  has been granted, unless the vehicle has been destroyed, and bring the  vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  and bumper standards within 120 days from the date the petition is  granted; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deliver the vehicle to the Secretary of Homeland Security for  export within 30 days from the date the importer is notified that the  petition has been granted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Abandon the vehicle to the United States within 30 days from  the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Destroy the vehicle within 30 days from the date the importer  is notified that the petition has been granted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Furnish NHTSA with documentary proof of the vehicle's  exportation, abandonment, or destruction within 15 days from the date of  such action.
