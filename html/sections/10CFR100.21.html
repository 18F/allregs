In applying this guide, the boundary of the population center shall be determined upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling in the application of this guide;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Site atmospheric dispersion characteristics must be evaluated and dispersion parameters established such that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Radiological effluent release limits associated with normal operation from the type of facility proposed to be located at the site can be met for any individual located offsite; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Radiological dose consequences of postulated accidents shall meet the criteria set forth in Sec. 50.34(a)(1) of this chapter for the type of facility proposed to be located at the site;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The physical characteristics of the site, including meteorology, geology, seismology, and hydrology must be evaluated and site characteristics established such that potential threats from such physical characteristics will pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Potential hazards associated with nearby transportation routes, industrial and military facilities must be evaluated and site characteristics established such that potential hazards from such routes and facilities will pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Site characteristics must be such that adequate security plans and measures can be developed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Physical characteristics unique to the proposed site that could pose a significant impediment to the development of emergency plans must be identified;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reactor sites should be located away from very densely populated centers. Areas of low population density are, generally, preferred. However, in determining the acceptability of a particular site located away from a very densely populated center but not in an area of low density, consideration will be given to safety, environmental, economic, or other factors, which may result in the site being found acceptable \3\.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Examples of these factors include, but are not limited to, such factors as the higher population density site having superior seismic characteristics, better access to skilled labor for construction, better rail and highway access, shorter transmission line requirements, or less environmental impact on undeveloped areas, wetlands or endangered species, etc. Some of these factors are included in, or impact, the other criteria included in this section.
