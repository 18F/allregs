                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any operator aggrieved by a decision of the Regional Director in connection with the regulations in this subpart may file with the Regional Director a written statement setting forth in detail the respects in which the decision is contrary to, or is in conflict with the facts, the law, or these regulations, or is otherwise in error. No such appeal will be considered unless it is filed with the Regional Director within thirty (30) days after the date of notification to the operator of the action or decision complained of. Upon receipt of such written statement from the aggrieved operator, the Regional Director shall promptly review the action or decision and either reverse his original decision or prepare his own statement, explaining that decision and the reasons therefor, and forward the statement and record on appeal to the Director for review and decision. Copies of the Regional Director's statement shall be furnished to the aggrieved operator, who shall have thirty (30) days within which to file exceptions to the Regional Director's decision. The Department has the discretion to initiate a hearing before the Office of Hearing and Appeals in a particular case (See 43 CFR 4.700).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The official files of the National Park Service on the proposed plan of operations and any testimony and documents submitted by the parties on which the decision of the Regional Director was based shall constitute the record on appeal. The Regional Director shall maintain the record under separate cover and shall certify that it was the record on which his decision was based at the time it was forwarded to the Director of the National Park Service. The National Park Service shall make the record available to the operator upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Director considers the record inadequate to support the decision on appeal, he may provide for the production of such additional evidence or information as may be appropriate,

or may remand the case to the Regional Director, with appropriate instructions for further action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On or before the expiration of forty-five (45) days after his receipt of the exceptions to the Regional Director's decision, the Director shall make his decision in writing: provided however, that if more than forty-five (45) days are required for a decision after the exceptions are received, the Director shall notify the parties to the appeal and specify the reason(s) for delay. The decision of the Director shall include: (1) A statement of facts; (2) conclusions; and (3) reasons upon which the conclusions are based. The decision of the Director shall be the final administrative action of the agency on a proposed plan of operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A decision of the Regional Director from which an appeal is taken shall not be automatically stayed by the filing of a statement of appeal. A request for a stay may accompany the statement of appeal or may be directed to the Director. The Director shall promptly rule on requests for stays. A decision of the Director on request for a stay shall constitute a final administrative decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where, under this subpart, the Superintendent has the authority to make the original decision, appeals may be taken in the manner provided by this section, as if the decision had been made by the Regional Director, except that the original statement of appeal shall be filed with the Superintendent, and if he decides not to reverse his original decision, the Regional Director shall have, except as noted below, the final review authority. The only decision of a Regional Director under this paragraph which shall be appealable by the Director is an appeal from a suspension under Sec. 9.51(b). Such an appeal shall follow the procedure of paragraphs (a)-(3) of this section.
