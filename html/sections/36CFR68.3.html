                            <p class="depth0">One set of standards--preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction--will apply to a property undergoing treatment, depending upon the property's significance, existing physical condition, the extent of documentation available and interpretive goals, when applicable. The standards will be applied taking into consideration the economic and technical feasibility of each project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Preservation. (1) A property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified, a property will be protected and, if necessary, stabilized until additional work may be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve existing historic materials and features will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection and properly documented for future research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The existing condition of historic features will be evaluated to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of a distinctive feature, the new material will match the old in composition, design, color and texture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rehabilitation. (1) A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or

examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Restoration. (1) A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that interprets the property and its restoration period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Materials and features from the restoration period will be retained and preserved. The removal of materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize the period will not be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve materials and features from the restoration period will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection and properly documented for future research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Materials, features, spaces and finishes that characterize other historical periods will be documented prior to their alteration or removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distinctive materials, features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the restoration period will be preserved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Deteriorated features from the restoration period will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Replacement of missing features from the restoration period will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. A false sense of history will not be created by adding conjectural features, features from other properties, or by combining features that never existed together historically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Archeological resources affected by a project will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reconstruction. (1) Reconstruction will be used to depict vanished or non-surviving portions of a property when documentary and physical evidence is available to permit accurate reconstruction with minimal conjecture and such reconstruction is essential to the public understanding of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reconstruction of a landscape, building, structure or object in its historic location will be preceded by a thorough archeological investigation to identify and evaluate those features and artifacts that are essential to an accurate reconstruction. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reconstruction will include measures to preserve any remaining historic materials, features, and spatial relationships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reconstruction will be based on the accurate duplication of historic

features and elements substantiated by documentary or physical evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different features from other historic properties. A reconstructed property will re-create the appearance of the non-surviving historic property in materials, design, color and texture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A reconstruction will be clearly identified as a contemporary re-creation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.</p>
