But a court, for good cause, may appoint other counsel whose background, knowledge, or experience would otherwise enable them to properly represent

the petitioner, with due consideration of the seriousness of the penalty and the unique and complex nature of the litigation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appointment of counsel meeting qualification standards established in conformity with 42 U.S.C. 14163(e)(1) and (2)(A), if the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 14163(e)(2)(B), (D), and (E) are also satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Competency standards not satisfying the benchmark criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be deemed adequate only if they otherwise reasonably assure a level of proficiency appropriate for State postconviction litigation in capital cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The mechanism must provide for compensation of appointed counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State's provision for compensation is presumptively adequate if the authorized compensation is comparable to or exceeds--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The compensation of counsel appointed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3599 in Federal habeas corpus proceedings reviewing capital cases from the State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The compensation of retained counsel in State postconviction proceedings in capital cases who meet State standards of competency sufficient under paragraph (b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compensation of appointed counsel in State appellate or trial proceedings in capital cases; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The compensation of attorneys representing the State in State postconviction proceedings in capital cases, subject to adjustment for private counsel to take account of overhead costs not otherwise payable as reasonable litigation expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions for compensation not satisfying the benchmark criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be deemed adequate only if the State mechanism is otherwise reasonably designed to ensure the availability for appointment of counsel who meet State standards of competency sufficient under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The mechanism must provide for payment of reasonable litigation expenses of appointed counsel. Such expenses may include, but are not limited to, payment for investigators, mitigation specialists, mental health and forensic science experts, and support personnel.
