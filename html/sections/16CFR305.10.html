The range of estimated annual operating costs or energy  efficiency ratings for each covered product (except fluorescent lamp  ballasts, metal halide lamp fixtures, lamps, showerheads, faucets, water  closets, urinals, ceiling fans, or televisions) shall be taken from the  appropriate appendix to this part in effect at the time the labels are  affixed to the product. The Commission shall publish revised ranges in  the Federal Register in 2017. When the ranges are revised, all  information disseminated after 90 days following the publication of the  revision shall conform to the revised ranges.

When the cost figures are revised, all  information disseminated after 90 days following the publication of the  revision shall conform to the new cost figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operating Costs or Efficiency Ratings Outside Current Range.  When the estimated annual operating cost or energy efficiency rating of  a given model of a covered product falls outside the limits of the  current range for that product, which could result from the introduction  of a new or changed model, the manufacturer shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Omit placement of such product on the scale that appears as  required by Sec.
