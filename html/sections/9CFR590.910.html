Sec. 590.500 through 590.580  applicable to inspected articles produced within the United States,  notice of that fact will be given by listing the name of such foreign  country in paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, egg products from  the countries so listed shall be eligible, subject to the provisions of  this part and other applicable laws and regulations, for importation  into the United States. Such products to be imported into the United  States from these foreign countries must meet, to the extent applicable,  the same standards and requirements that apply to comparable domestic  products as set forth in these regulations. Egg products from foreign  countries not listed herein are not eligible for importation into the  United States, except as provided by Sec. 590.960. In determining if  the inspection system of a foreign country is the equivalent of the  system maintained by the United States, the Administrator shall review  the inspection regulations of the foreign country and make a survey to  determine the manner in which the inspection system is administered  within the foreign country. The survey of the foreign inspection system  may be expedited by payment by the interested Government agency in the  foreign country of the travel expenses incurred in making the survey.  After approval   of the inspection system of a foreign country, the Administrator may, as  often and to the extent deemed necessary, authorize representatives of  the Department to review the system to determine that it is maintained  in such a manner as to be the equivalent of the system maintained by the  United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It has been determined that each of the following foreign  countries maintain an egg products inspection system that is the  equivalent of the system maintained by the United States: Canada, The  Netherlands.
