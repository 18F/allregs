                                Sec. 4.177  Discharging fringe benefit obligations by equivalent means.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and specified in the wage determination and  the contract, to be offset by the fringe benefit payments or equivalents  which are furnished or paid pursuant to section 2(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a contractor substitutes fringe benefits not specified in  the fringe benefit determination contained in the contract for fringe  benefits which are so specified, the substituted fringe benefits, like  those for which the contract provisions are prescribed, must be ``bona  fide'' fringe benefits, as that term is defined in Sec. 4.171.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a contractor discharges his fringe benefit obligation by  furnishing, in lieu of those benefits specified in the applicable fringe  benefit determination, other ``bona fide'' fringe benefits, cash  payments, or a combination thereof, the substituted fringe benefits and/ or cash payments must be ``equivalent'' to the benefits specified in the  determination. As used in this subpart, the terms equivalent fringe  benefit and cash equivalent mean equal in terms of monetary cost to the  contractor. Thus, as set forth in Sec. 4.172, if an applicable fringe  benefit determination calls for a particular fringe benefit in a stated  amount and the contractor furnished this benefit through contributions  in a lesser amount, the contractor must furnish the employee with the  difference between the amount stated in the determination and the actual  cost of the benefit which the contractor provides. This principle may be  illustrated by the example given in Sec. 4.175(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Furnishing equivalent fringe benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A contractor's  obligation to furnish fringe benefits which are stated in a specified  cash amount may be discharged by furnishing any combination of ``bona  fide'' fringe benefits costing an equal amount. Thus, if an applicable  determination specifies that 20 cents per hour is to be paid into a  pension fund, this fringe benefit obligation will be deemed to be met  if, instead, hospitalization benefits costing not less than 20 cents per  hour are provided. The same obligation will be met if hospitalization  benefits costing 10 cents an hour and life insurance benefits costing 10  cents an hour are provided. As set forth in Sec. 4.171(c), no benefit  required to be furnished the employee by any other law, such as workers'  compensation, may be credited toward satisfying the fringe benefit  requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contractor who wishes to furnish equivalent fringe benefits in  lieu of those benefits which are not stated in a specified cash amount,  such as ``one week paid vacation'', must first determine the equivalent  cash value of such benefits in accordance with the rules set forth in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Furnishing cash equivalents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fringe benefit obligations may  be discharged by paying to the employee on his regular payday, in  addition to the monetary wage required, a cash amount per hour in lieu  of the specified fringe benefits, provided such amount is equivalent to  the cost of the fringe benefits required. If, for example, an employee's  monetary rate under an applicable determination is $4.50 an hour, and  the fringe benefits to be furnished are hospitalization benefits costing  20 cents an hour and retirement benefits costing 20 cents an hour, the  fringe benefit obligation is discharged if instead of furnishing the  required fringe benefits, the employer pays the employee, in cash, 40  cents per hour as the cash equivalent of the fringe benefits in addition  to the $4.50 per hour wage rate required under the applicable wage  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hourly cash equivalent of those fringe benefits which are  not stated in the applicable determination in terms of hourly cash  amounts may   be obtained by mathematical computation through the use of pertinent  factors such as the monetary wages paid the employee and the hours of  work attributable to the period, if any, by which fringe benefits are  measured in the determination. If the employee's regular rate of pay is  greater than the minimum monetary wage specified in the wage  determination and the contract, the former must be used for this  computation, and if the fringe benefit determination does not specify  any daily or weekly hours of work by which benefits are to be measured,  a standard 8-hour day and 40-hour week will be considered applicable.  The application of these rules in typical situations is illustrated in  paragraphs (c)(3) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where fringe benefits are stated as a percentage of the monetary  rate, the hourly cash equivalent is determined by multiplying the stated  percentage by the employees' regular or basic (i.e., wage determination)  rate of pay, whichever is greater. For example, if the determination  calls for a 5 percent pension fund payment and the employee is paid a  monetary rate of $4.50 an hour, or if the employee earns $4.50 an hour  on a piece-work basis in a particular workweek, the cash equivalent of  that payment would be 22\1/2\ cents an hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the determination lists a particular fringe benefit in such  terms as $8 a week, the hourly cash equivalent is determined by dividing  the amount stated in the determination by the number of working hours to  which the amount is attributable. For example, if a determination lists  a fringe benefit as ``pension--$8 a week'', and does not specify weekly  hours, the hourly cash equivalent is 20 cents per hour, i.e., $8 divided  by 40, the standard number of non-overtime working hours in a week.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In determining the hourly cash equivalent of those fringe  benefits which are not stated in the determination in terms of a cash  amount, but are stated, for example, as ``nine paid holidays per year''  or ``1 week paid vacation after one year of service'', the employee's  hourly monetary rate of pay is multiplied by the number of hours making  up the paid holidays or vacation. Unless the hours contemplated in the  fringe benefit are specified in the determination, a standard 8-hour day  and 40-hour week is considered applicable. The total annual cost so  determined is divided by 2,080, the standard number of non-overtime  hours in a year of work, to arrive at the hourly cash equivalent. This  principle may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a particular determination lists as a fringe benefit ``nine  holidays per year'' and the employee's hourly rate of pay is $4.50, the  $4.50 is multiplied by 72 (9 days of 8 hours each) and the result, $324,  is then divided by 2,080 to arrive at the hourly cash equivalent,  $0.1557 an hour. See Sec. 4.174(c)(4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the determination requires ``one week paid vacation after  one year of service'', and the employee's hourly rate of pay is $4.50,  the $4.50 is multiplied by 40 and the result, $180.00, is then divided  by 2,080 to arrive at the hourly cash equivalent, $0.0865 an hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where an employer elects to pay an hourly cash equivalent in  lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in accordance with paragraph  (c)(5) of this section, such payments need commence only after the  employee has satisfied the ``after one year of service'' requirement.  However, should the employee terminate employment for any reason before  receiving the full amount of vested vacation benefits due, the employee  must be paid the full amount of any difference remaining as the final  cash payment. For example, an employee becomes eligible for a week's  vacation pay on March 1. The employer elects to pay this employee an  hourly cash equivalent beginning that date; the employee terminates  employment on March 31. Accordingly, as this employee has received only  \1/12\ of the vacation pay to which he/she is entitled, the employee is  due the remaining \11/12\ upon termination. As set forth in Sec.  4.173(e), the rate applicable to the computation of cash equivalents for  vacation benefits is the hourly wage rate in effect at the time such  equivalent payments are actually made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Furnishing a combination of equivalent fringe benefits and cash  payments. Fringe benefit obligations may be discharged by furnishing any  combination of cash or fringe benefits as illustrated   in the preceding paragraphs of this section, in monetary amounts the  total of which is equivalent, under the rules therein stated, to the  determined fringe benefits specified in the contract. For example, if an  applicable determination specifies that 20 cents per hour is to be paid  into a pension fund, this fringe benefit obligation will be deemed to be  met if instead, hospitalization benefits costing 15 cents an hour and a  cash equivalent payment of 5 cents an hour are provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e))</em>. Fringe  benefit payments which qualify for such exclusion are described in  subpart C of Regulations, 29 CFR part 778. When such fringe benefits are  required to be furnished to service employees engaged in contract  performance, the right to compute overtime pay in accordance with the  above rule is not lost to a contractor or subcontractor because it  discharges its obligation under this Act to furnish such fringe benefits  through alternative equivalents as provided in this section. If it  furnishes equivalent benefits or makes cash payments, or both, to such  an employee as authorized herein, the amounts thereof, which discharge  the employer's obligation to furnish such specified fringe benefits, may  be excluded pursuant to this Act from the employee's regular or basic  rate of pay in computing any overtime pay due the employee under any  other Federal law. No such exclusion can operate, however, to reduce an  employee's regular or basic rate of pay below the monetary wage rate  specified as the applicable minimum wage rates under sections 2(a)(1),  2(b), or 4(c) of this Act or under other law or an employment contract.</p>
