                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lowest landed cost and delivery considerations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as  provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, in contracts for  the Foreign Agricultural Service for commodities and related freight  shipment for delivery to foreign destinations, the contracting officer  shall consider the lowest landed cost of delivering the commodity to the  intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination will be  calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the  commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and  practicable to meet 46 U.S.C. 55314(c)(3) and cargo preference  requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the  remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional  factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued  with respect to a commodity procurement or a related freight procurement  will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the  lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to  reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity  or related freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or  related freight, results in a lower landed cost to the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department may contact any port prior to award to determine  the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the  port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo.  Factors considered in this determination may include, but not be limited  to, the adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom  from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and  warehousing practices. The Department may consider the use of another  coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely  affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in  a safe and timely manner. Such situations include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A port is congested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Port facilities are overloaded;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without  delay;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the  cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of  the Department to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of other than lowest landed cost. In order to ensure that  commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations  and without damage, the contracting officer may award an acquisition  without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process  will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent  humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign  destination;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the  adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect  commodities) and other similar factors may adversely affect the delivery  of such commodities through damage or untimely delivery. Such similar  factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded  facilities at the port; vessels not being able to dock and load cargo  without delay due to conditions at the port; labor disputes or lack of  labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely  manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and  other supporting facilities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final  delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the timely delivery  of the commodity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Other similar situations arise that materially affect the  administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is  being procured; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The contracting officer determines that extenuating  circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest-landed cost, or  that efficiency and cost-savings justify use of types of ocean   service that would not involve an analysis of freight. However, in all  such cases, commodities would be transported in compliance with cargo  preference requirements. Examples of extenuating circumstances are  events such as internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent  humanitarian conditions threatening the lives of persons at the foreign  destination. Other types of services may include, but are not limited  to, multi-trip voyage charters, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity  (IDIQ), delivery cost and freight (C & F), delivery cost insurance and  freight (CIF), and indexed ocean freight costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a contracting officer determines that action may be  appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the  acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer will provide  to the Head of Contracting Activity Designee a written request to obtain  commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost  basis consistent with Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations. This request  shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed  cost basis. The Head of the Contracting Activity Designee, or the  designee one level above the contracting officer, may either accept or  reject this request and shall document this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiple offers or delivery points. If more than one offer for  the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has  been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a  freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost  for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the  contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point  by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to  prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Freight shipping and rates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining the lowest-landed  cost, the Department shall use the freight rates offered in response to  solicitations issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Freight rates offered must be submitted as specified in the  solicitation issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee  organization. Any such solicitation issued by a grantee organization  must contain the following elements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If directed by the Department, include a closing time for the  receipt of written freight offers and state that late written freight  offers will not be considered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide that freight offers are required to have a canceling  date no later than the last contract lay day specified in the  solicitation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide the same deadline for receipt of written freight  offers from both U.S. flag vessel and non-U.S. flag vessels; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be received and opened prior to any related offer for  acquisition of commodities to be shipped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department may require organizations that will receive  commodities from the Department to submit information relating to the  capacity of a U.S. port, or, if applicable, a terminal, prior to the  acquisition of such commodities or freight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Freight rate notification. If the Department is not the party  procuring freight with respect to a shipment of an agricultural  commodity for delivery to a foreign destination, the organization that  will receive commodities from the Department, or its shipping agent,  shall be notified by the Department of the vessel freight rate used in  determining the commodity contract award and the organization will be  responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the  vessel representing the freight rate.</p>
