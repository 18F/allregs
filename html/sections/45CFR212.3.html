Such statement shall, if possible, incorporate or have attached thereto, all available pertinent information concerning the individual.

In case of war, threat of war, invasion, or similar crisis, a determination by the Department of State that such a condition is the general cause for the return of citizens of the United States and their dependents from a particular foreign country, and evidence that an individual has returned, or, been brought, from such country to the United States shall be considered sufficient identification of the reason for his return to, or entry into the United States; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> He is without resources immediately accessible to meet his needs.
