                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principle. A provider of services that customarily furnishes an  individual items or services that are more expensive than the items or  services determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed  health services described in Sec. 413.30, may charge an individual  entitled to benefits under Medicare for such more expensive items or  services even though not requested by the individual. The charge,  however, may not exceed the amount by which the cost of (or, if less,  the customary charges for) such more expensive items or services  furnished by such provider in the second cost reporting period  immediately preceding the cost reporting period in which such charges  are imposed exceeds the applicable limit imposed under the provisions of  Sec. 413.30. This charge may be made only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor determines that the charges have been calculated  properly in accordance with the provisions of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The services are not emergency services as defined in paragraph  (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The admitting physician has no direct or indirect financial  interest in such provider;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS has provided notice to the public through notice in a  newspaper of general circulation servicing the provider's locality and  such other notice as the Secretary may require, of any charges the  provider is authorized to impose on individuals entitled to benefits  under Medicare on account of costs in excess of the costs determined to  be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services under  Medicare; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The provider has, in the manner described in paragraph (e) of  this section, identified such charges to such individual or person  acting on his behalf as charges to meet the costs in excess of the costs  determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health  services under Medicare.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provider request to charge beneficiaries for costs in excess of  limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a provider's actual costs (or, if less, the customary  charges) in the second preceding cost period exceed the prospective  limits established for such costs, the contractor will, at the  provider's request, validate in advance the charges that may be made to  the beneficiaries for the excess.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a provider does not have a second preceding cost period and  is a new provider as defined in Sec. 413.30(e), the provider, subject  to validation by the contractor, will estimate the current cost of the  service to which a limit is being applied. Such amount will be adjusted  to an amount equivalent to costs in the second preceding year by use of  a factor to be developed based on estimates of cost increases during the  preceding two years and published by SSA or CMS. The amount thus derived  will be used in lieu of the second preceding cost period amount in  determining the charge to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To obtain consideration of such a request, the provider must  submit to the contractor a statement indicating the chagre for which it  is seeking validation and providing the data and method used to  determine the amount. Such statement should include the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provider's name and number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identity of class and prospective cost limit for the class in  which the provider has been included;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Amount of charge and cost period in which the charge is to be  imposed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cost and customary charge for items and services furnished to  beneficiaries; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cost period ending date of the second reporting period  immediately preceding the cost period in which the charge is to be  imposed. The contractor may request such additional information as it  finds necessary with respect to the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provider charges--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishing the charges. If the actual  cost incurred (or, if less, the customary charges) in the prior period  determined under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the limits  applicable to the pertinent period, the provider may charge the  beneficiary to the extent costs in the second preceding cost reporting  period (or the equivalent when there is no second preceding period)  exceed the current cost limits. (Data from the most   recently submitted appropriate cost report will be used in determining  the actual cost.) For example, if a limit of $58 per day is applied to  the cost of general routine services for the provider's cost reporting  period starting in calendar year 1975 and if the provider's actual  general routine cost in the second preceding reporting period, that is,  the reporting period starting in calendar year 1973, was $60 per day,  the provider (after first having obtained contractor validation and  subject to the considerations and requirements specified in paragraph  (a) of this section) may charge Medicare Part A beneficiaries up to $2  per day for general routine services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjusting cost. Program reimbursement for the costs to which  limits imposed under Sec. 413.30 are applied in any cost reporting  period will not exceed the lesser of the provider's actual cost or the  limits imposed under Sec. 413.30. If program reimbursement for items or  services to which such limits are applied plus the charges to  beneficiaries for such items or services imposed under this section  exceed the provider's actual cost for such items or services, program  payment to the provider will be reduced to the extent program payment  plus charges to the beneficiaries exceed actual cost. If the provider's  actual cost for general routine services in 1975 was $57,000, the cost  limit was $58,000, and billed charges to Medicare Part A beneficiaries  were $2,000, the provider would receive $55,000 from the program  ($57,000 actual cost minus the $2,000 in charges to the beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition of emergency services. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, emergency services are those hospital services  that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the  health of the individual, and which, because of the threat to the life  or health of the individual, necessitate the use of the most accessible  hospital (as determined under Sec. 424.106 of this chapter) available  and equipped to furnish such services. If an individual has been  admitted to such hospital as an inpatient because of an emergency, the  emergency will be deemed to continue until it is safe from a medical  standpoint to move the individual to another hospital or other  institution or to discharge him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identification of charges to individual. For purposes of  paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a provider must give or send to the  individual or his representative, a schedule of all items and services  that the individual might need and for which the provider imposes  charges under this section, and the charge for each. Such schedule must  specify that the charges are necessary to meet the costs in excess of  the costs determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed  health services under Medicare and include such other information as CMS  considers necessary to protect the individual's rights under this  section. The provider, in arranging for the individual's admission,  first service, or start of care, must give or send this schedule to the  individual or his representative when arrangements are being made for  such services or if this is not feasible, as soon thereafter as is  practicable but no later than at the initiation of services.
