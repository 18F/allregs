                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  of such Act shall apply only to the extent that such underpayment is so  attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Declarations and payments of estimated tax. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a  taxable year beginning before December 30, 1969, section 946(b) of the  Tax Reform Act of 1969 provides transitional rules with respect to the  payment of estimated tax and, in the case of an individual, the filing  of a declaration of estimated tax. Under such section 946(b) in the case  of such a year, if any taxpayer is required to make a declaration or  amended declaration of estimated tax, or to pay any amount or additional  amount of estimated tax, by reason of the amendments made by the Act,  such amount or additional amount shall be paid ratably on or before each  of the remaining installment dates for the taxable year beginning with  the first installment date on or after February 15, 1970. For purposes  of section 946(b) of such Act and this section, the term ``installment  date'' means any date on which, under section 6153 or 6154 of the Code  (whichever is applicable), an installment payment of estimated tax is  required to be made by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to any declaration or payment of estimated tax  before February 15, 1970, sections 6015, 6153, 6154, 6654, and 6655 of  the Code shall be applied without regard to the amendments made by such  Act. Therefore,   any underpayment which occurs solely by reason of the amendments made by  such Act shall not be treated as an underpayment in the case of  installment dates before February 15, 1970. Similarly, in the case of a  taxpayer all of whose installment dates occur prior to February 15,  1970, no payment of estimated tax need be made to reflect the amendments  made by such Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following example illustrates the application of the  provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year from July 1,  1969, through June 30, 1970, had, without regard to the enactment of the  Tax Reform Act of 1969, a total tax liability, which would have been  shown on his return, of $500. A is not a farmer or fisherman described  in section 6037(b). A's tax liability is increased by $20 to $520,  attributable to an amendment made by such Act. A makes an installment  payment of estimated tax of $90 on each of the following four  installment dates: October 15, 1969; December 15, 1969; March 15, 1970;  and July 15, 1970. Assume that A is unaffected by the exceptions  provided in section 6654(d). Therefore, A is underpaid by $10 on both  October 15 and December 15, and by $18 on both March 15 and July 15.  Such underpayments are computed as follows:  (a) October 15 and December 15 installment dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax without regard to Tax Reform Act of 1969...............
