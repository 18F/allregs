Therefore the following additional requirements must be met to qualify for type A freeboards:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Machinery casings must be protected by an enclosed superstructure or deckhouse unless intact bulkheads are used on all sides on the freeboard deck.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exposed machinery casings may be fitted with weathertight doors providing they lead to a space or passageway as strong as an enclosed superstructure from which a second interior weathertight door is provided for access to the engine room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hatchways on the exposed freeboard or forecastle decks must be provided with watertight covers of steel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless a separate fore and aft access is provided below the freeboard deck, a permanent fore and aft gangway must be fitted at the superstructure deck level between poop and all other deckhouses used in the essential operation of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Type ``A'' vessels must be fitted with open rails for at least half the length of the exposed parts of the weather deck. Where superstructures are connected by trunks, open rails must be fitted for the whole length of the exposed parts of the freeboard deck.</p>
