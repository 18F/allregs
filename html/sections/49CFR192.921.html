                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods depending on the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified to the covered segment (See Sec. 192.917).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered segment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with Sec. 192.939.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in Sec. 192.923 and with, as applicable, the requirements specified in Secs. 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with Sec. 192.949. An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prioritizing segments. An operator must prioritize the covered pipeline segments for the baseline assessment according to a risk analysis that considers the potential threats to each covered segment. The risk analysis must comply with the requirements in Sec. 192.917.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assessment for particular threats. In choosing an assessment method for the baseline assessment of each covered segment, an operator must take the actions required in Sec. 192.917(e) to address particular threats that it has identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time period. An operator must prioritize all the covered segments for assessment in accordance with Sec. 192.917 (c) and paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must assess at least 50% of the covered segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by December 17, 2007. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of all covered segments by December 17, 2012.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior assessment. An operator may use a prior integrity assessment conducted before December 17, 2002 as a baseline assessment for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the baseline requirements in this subpart and subsequent remedial actions to address the conditions listed in Sec. 192.933 have been carried out. In addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered segment according

to the requirements of Sec. 192.937 and Sec. 192.939.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Newly identified areas. When an operator identifies a new high consequence area (see Sec. 192.905), an operator must complete the baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified high consequence area within ten (10) years from the date the area is identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Newly installed pipe. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of a newly-installed segment of pipe covered by this subpart within ten (10) years from the date the pipe is installed. An operator may conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to satisfy the requirement for a baseline assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Plastic transmission pipeline. If the threat analysis required in Sec. 192.917(d) on a plastic transmission pipeline indicates that a covered segment is susceptible to failure from causes other than third-party damage, an operator must conduct a baseline assessment of the segment in accordance with the requirements of this section and of Sec. 192.917. The operator must justify the use of an alternative assessment method that will address the identified threats to the covered segment.
