The International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (22 CFR parts 120-130) administered by the Directorate of  Defense Trade Controls relate to defense articles and defense services  on the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121). Section 38 of the Arms  Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778). (Also see paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of  this section).</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (b)(1)(i): If a defense article or service is  controlled by the U.S. Munitions List set forth in the International  Traffic in Arms Regulations, its export and temporary import is  regulated by the Department of State. The President has delegated the  authority to control defense articles and services for purposes of  permanent import to the Attorney General. The defense articles and  services controlled by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General  collectively comprise the U.S. Munitions List under the Arms Export  Control Act (AECA). As the Attorney General exercises independent  delegated authority to designate defense articles and services for  purposes of permanent import controls, the permanent import control list  administered by the Department of Justice has been separately labeled  the U.S. Munitions Import List (27 CFR Part 447) to distinguish it from   the list set out in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. In  carrying out the functions delegated to the Attorney General pursuant to  the AECA, the Attorney General shall be guided by the views of the  Secretary of State on matters affecting world peace, and the external  security and foreign policy of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  Regulations administered by OFAC implement broad controls and embargo  transactions with certain foreign countries. These regulations include  controls on exports and reexports to certain countries (31 CFR chapter  V).

Regulations  administered by NRC control the export and reexport of commodities  related to nuclear reactor vessels (10 CFR part 110). Atomic Energy Act  of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. part 2011 et seq.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Department of Energy (DOE). Regulations administered by DOE  control the export and reexport of technology related to the production  of special nuclear materials (10 CFR part 810). Atomic Energy Act of  1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 2011 et seq.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Regulations administered by  PTO provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified  technology in the form of a patent application or an amendment,  modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof (37 CFR part 5).  BIS has delegated authority under the Export Administration Act to the  PTO to approve exports and reexports of such technology which is subject  to the EAR. Exports and reexports of such technology not approved under  PTO regulations must comply with the EAR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State Foreign  Military Sales (FMS) Program. Items that are subject to the EAR that are  sold, leased or loaned by the Department of Defense to a foreign country  or international organization under the FMS Program of the Arms Export  Control Act pursuant to a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)  authorizing such transfers are not ``subject to the EAR,'' but rather,  are subject to the authority of the Arms Export Control Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prerecorded phonograph records reproducing in whole or in part,  the content of printed books, pamphlets, and miscellaneous publications,  including newspapers and periodicals; printed books, pamphlets, and  miscellaneous publications including bound newspapers and periodicals;  children's picture and painting books; newspaper and periodicals,  unbound, excluding waste; music books; sheet music; calendars and  calendar blocks, paper; maps, hydrographical charts, atlases,  gazetteers, globe covers, and globes (terrestrial and celestial);  exposed and developed microfilm reproducing, in whole or in part, the  content of any of the above; exposed and developed motion picture film  and soundtrack; and advertising printed matter exclusively related  thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Publicly available technology and software, except software  classified under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are already published or will be published as described in Sec.  734.7 of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as  described in Sec. 734.8 of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Are included in certain patent applications, as described in  Sec. 734.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section: A printed book  or other printed material setting forth encryption source code is not  itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However,  notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic  form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to the  EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)). Publicly available encryption object code  software classified under ECCN 5D002 is not subject to the EAR when the  corresponding source code meets the criteria specified in Sec.  740.13(e) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ``Items subject to the EAR'' consist of the items listed on the  Commerce Control List (CCL) in part 774 of the EAR and all other items  which meet the definition of that term. For ease of reference and  classification purposes, items subject to the EAR which   are not listed on the CCL are designated as ``EAR99.'' Items subject to  temporary CCL controls are classified under the ECCN 0Y521 series (i.e.,  0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521, and 0E521) pursuant to Sec. 742.6(a)(7) of  the EAR, while a determination is made as to whether classification  under a revised or new ECCN, or an EAR99 designation, is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commodity classification determinations and advisory opinions  issued by BIS are not, and may not be relied upon as, determinations  that the items in question are ``subject to the EAR,'' as described in  Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Items subject to the EAR may be exported, reexported, or  transferred in country under licenses, agreements, or other approvals  from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  pursuant to Sec. Sec. 120.5(b) and 126.6(c) of the International  Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR 120.5(b) and 126.6(c)).  Exports, reexports, or in-country transfers not in accordance with the  terms and conditions of a license, agreement, or other approval under  Sec. 120.5(b) of the ITAR requires separate authorization from BIS.  Exports, reexports, or in-country transfers of items subject to the EAR  under a Foreign Military Sales case that exceed the scope of Sec.  126.6(c) of the ITAR or the scope of actions made by the Department of  State's Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers require separate  authorization from BIS.
