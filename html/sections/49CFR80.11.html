                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time a project sponsor submits an application, the DOT  shall require a preliminary rating opinion letter. This letter is a  conditional credit assessment from a nationally recognized credit rating  agency that provides a preliminary indication of the project's overall  creditworthiness and that specifically addresses the potential of the  project's senior debt obligations (those obligations having a lien  senior to that of the TIFIA credit instrument on the pledged security)  to achieve an investment-grade rating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The full funding of a secured (direct) loan, loan guarantee, or  line of credit shall be contingent on the assignment of an investment- grade rating by a nationally recognized bond rating agency to all  project obligations that have a lien senior to that of the Federal  credit instrument on the pledged security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neither the preliminary rating opinion letter nor the formal  credit rating should reflect the effect of bond insurance, unless that  insurance provides credit enhancement that secures the TIFIA obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The project sponsor must annually provide, at no cost to the  Federal Government, ongoing credit evaluations of the project and  related debt obligations, including an annual assessment of the TIFIA  credit instrument. The evaluations are to be performed by a nationally  recognized credit rating agency and provided to the DOT throughout the  life of the TIFIA credit instrument. In addition, the project sponsor  will furnish the DOT with any other credit surveillance reports on the  TIFIA-assisted project as soon as they are available.
