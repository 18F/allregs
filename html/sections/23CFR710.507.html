Real property owned by State and local governments  incorporated within a federally funded project can be used as a credit  toward the State matching share of total project cost. A credit cannot  exceed the State's matching share required by the project agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. Credits can be applied to projects where the  initial project agreement is executed after June 9, 1998.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemptions. Credits are not available for lands acquired with  any form of Federal financial assistance, or for lands already  incorporated and used for transportation purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State contributions. Real property acquired with State funds and  required for federally-assisted projects may support a credit toward the  non-Federal share of project costs. The STD must prepare documentation  supporting all credits including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certification that the acquisition satisfied the conditions in  23 CFR 710.501(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Justification of the value of credit applied. Acquisition costs  incurred by the State to acquire title can be used as justification for  the value of the real property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Credit for local government contributions. A contribution by a  unit of local government of real property which is offered for credit,  in connection with a project eligible for assistance under this title,  shall be credited against the State share of the project at fair market  value of the real property. Property may also be presented for project  use with the understanding that no credit for its use is sought. The STD  shall assure that the acquisition satisfied the conditions in 23 CFR   710.501(b), and that documentation justifies the amount of the credit.</p>
