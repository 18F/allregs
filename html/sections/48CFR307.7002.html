OPDIV program officials shall meet with the HCA and the Chief Grants Management Officer, or their designees, as necessary, to determine whether award is to be made through the acquisition or assistance process. This determination shall normally occur prior to the time when the AAP is reviewed and approved so that the AAP will reflect all known proposed contract actions. The HCA shall fully document a shift from one award instrument to another in the appropriate files to show a fundamental change in program purpose that unequivocally justifies the rationale for the shift.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contracting Officer shall confirm the appropriateness of the use of the contract instrument when reviewing the AP or other acquisition request document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OPDIVs shall ensure that the choice of instrument is in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308 and applicable HHS policies. If, however, there are major individual transactions or programs which contain elements of both acquisition and assistance in such a way that they cannot be characterized as having a principal purpose of one or the other instrument, OPDIVs shall obtain guidance from ASFR/OGAPA/DA, through appropriate acquisition channels, including the HCA, before proceeding with a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any public notice, program announcement, solicitation, or request for applications or proposals, or request for quotations shall indicate whether the intended relationship will be one of acquisition or financial assistance and specify the award instrument the OPDIV will use.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 307.71_Acquisition Plan</p>
