                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations at Secs. 121.402, 121.1102, and 121.1103 of this  chapter also apply to NAICS code appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of OHA's decision. If OHA grants the appeal (changes the  NAICS code), and the contracting officer receives OHA's decision by the  date offers are due, the contracting officer must amend the solicitation  to reflect the new NAICS code. If the contracting officer receives OHA's  decision after the date offers are due, OHA's decision will not apply to  the pending procurement, but will apply to future solicitations for the  same supplies or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Summary dismissal. OHA may summarily dismiss a NAICS appeal  either on the Judge's own initiative or on motion by a party. A summary  dismissal may be with or without prejudice, and may be issued before the  date set for close of record. Grounds for summary dismissal include:  premature appeal, withdrawn appeal, settlement, cancellation of the  procurement, and contract award.  [75 FR 47442, Aug. 6, 2010]</p>
