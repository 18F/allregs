                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part:</p><p class="depth0">Agency, as used in this part, means a department, agency, or  instrumentality of the United States Government.</p><p class="depth0">Agency claim means any demand by an agency upon a TSP for the  payment of overcharges, ordinary debts, fines, penalties, administrative  fees, special charges, and interest.</p><p class="depth0">Bill of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of lading  (but includes GBLs), is the document used as a receipt of goods, and  documentary evidence of title. It is also a contract of carriage when  movement is under 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 49 U.S.C. 13712.</p><p class="depth0">Cash means cash, personal checks, personal charge cards, and  travelers checks. Cash may only be used to pay for transportation  expenses in extremely limited cases where government payment mechanisms  are not available or acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">Document reference number means the unique number on a bill of  lading, Government Bill of Lading, Government Transportation Request, or  transportation ticket, used to track the movement of shipments and  individuals.</p><p class="depth0">EDI signature means a discrete authentication code which serves in  place of a paper signature and binds parties to the terms and conditions  of a contract in electronic communication.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic commerce means electronic techniques for performing  business transactions (ordering, billing, and paying for goods and  services), including electronic mail or messaging, Internet technology,  electronic bulletin boards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers,  and electronic data interchange.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic data interchange means electronic techniques for carrying  out transportation transactions using electronic transmissions of the  information between computers instead of paper documents. These  electronic transmissions must use established and published formats and  codes as authorized by the applicable Federal Information Processing  Standards.</p><p class="depth0">Electronic funds transfer means any transfer of funds, other than  transactions initiated by cash, check, or similar paper instrument, that  is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or  magnetic tape, for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing  a financial institution to debit or credit an account. The term includes  Automated Clearinghouse transfers, Fed Wire transfers, and transfers  made at automatic teller machines and point of sale terminals.</p><p class="depth0">Government bill of lading (GBL) is the transportation document used  as a receipt of goods, evidence of title, and a contract of carriage for  Government international shipments.</p><p class="depth0">Government contractor-issued charge card means both an individually  billed travel card, which the individual is required to pay, and a  centrally billed account for paying travel expenses, which the agency is  required to pay.</p><p class="depth0">Government Transportation Request (GTR) means Optional Form 1169,  the Government document used to buy transportation services. The  document normally obligates the Government to pay for the transportation  services provided.</p><p class="depth0">Offset means agency use of money owed by the agency to a  transportation service provider (TSP) to cover a previous debt incurred  to the agency by the TSP.</p><p class="depth0">Ordinary debt means an amount that a TSP owes an agency other than  for the repayment of an overcharge. Ordinary debts include, but are not  limited to, payments for transportation services ordered and not  provided (including unused transportation tickets), duplicate payments,  and amounts for which a TSP is liable because of loss and/or damage to  property it transported.</p><p class="depth0">Overcharge means those charges for transportation and travel  services that exceed those applicable under the contract for carriage.  This also includes charges more than those applicable under rates, fares  and charges established pursuant to section 13712 and 10721 of the  Revised Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 13712 and 10721),  or other equivalent contract, arrangement or exemption from regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Postpayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents  after payment to decide their validity, propriety, and conformity with  tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders. This process may also  include subsequent adjustments and collections actions taken against a  TSP by the Government.</p><p class="depth0">Prepayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents  before payment to determine their validity, propriety, and conformity  with tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders.</p><p class="depth0">Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of Lading,  Optional Form 1203, means the agency transportation document used as a  receipt of goods, evidence of title, and generally   a contract of carriage. It is only available for the transportation of  household goods. Use of this form is mandatory for Department of  Defense, but optional for other agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Rate authority means the document that establishes the legal charges  for a transportation shipment. Charges included in a rate authority are  those rates, fares, and charges for transportation and related services  contained in tariffs, tenders, and other equivalent documents.</p><p class="depth0">Released value is stated in dollars and is considered the assigned  value of the cargo for reimbursement purposes, not necessarily the  actual value of the cargo. Released value may be more or less than the  actual value of the cargo. The released value is the maximum amount that  could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage for the  shipments of freight and household goods. In return, when negotiating  for rates and the released value is proposed to be less than the actual  value of the cargo, the TSP should offer a rate lower than other rates  for shipping cargo at full value. The statement of released value may be  shown on any applicable tariff, tender, contract, transportation  document or other documents covering the shipment.</p><p class="depth0">Reparation means the payment involving a TSP to or from an agency of  an improper transportation billing as determined by a postpayment audit.  Improper routing, overcharges, or duplicate payments may cause such  improper billing. This is different from payments to settle a claim for  loss and damage to items shipped under those rates.</p><p class="depth0">Standard carrier alpha code (SCAC) means an unique four-letter code  assigned to each TSP by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association,  Inc.</p><p class="depth0">Statement of difference means a statement issued by an agency or its  designated audit contractor during a prepayment audit when they  determine that a TSP has billed the agency for more than the proper  amount for the services. This statement tells the TSP on the invoice,  the amount allowed and the basis for the proper charges. The statement  also cites the applicable rate references and other data relied on for  support. The agency issues a separate statement of difference for each  transportation transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Statement of difference rebuttal means a document used by the agency  to respond to a TSP's claim about an improper reduction made against the  TSP's original bill by the paying agency.</p><p class="depth0">Supplemental bill means a bill for services that the TSP submits to  the agency for additional payment after reimbursement for the original  bill. The need to submit a supplemental bill may occur due to an  incorrect first bill or due to charges which were not included on the  original bill.</p><p class="depth0">Taxpayer identification number (TIN) means the number required by  the Internal Revenue Service to be used by the TSP in reporting income  tax or other returns. For a TSP, the TIN is an employer identification  number.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation document (TD) means any executed agreement for  transportation service, such as a bill of lading (including a Government  Bill of Lading), a Government Transportation Request, or transportation  ticket.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation service means service involved in the physical  movement (from one location to another) of products, people, household  goods, and any other objects by a TSP for an agency as well as  activities directly relating to or supporting that movement. Examples of  this are storage, crating, or connecting appliances.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation service provider (TSP) means any party, person,  agent, or carrier that provides freight or passenger transportation and  related services to an agency. For a freight shipment this would include  packers, truckers, and storers. For passenger transportation this would  include airlines, travel agents and travel management centers.</p><p class="depth0">Transportation service provider claim means any demand by the TSP  for amounts not included in the original bill that the TSP believes an  agency owes them. This includes amounts deducted or offset by an agency;  amounts previously refunded by the TSP, which they now believe they are  owed; and any subsequent bills from the TSP resulting from a transaction  that was pre- or postpayment audited by the GSA Audit Division.</p><p class="depth0">Virtual GBL (VGBL) means the use of a unique GBL number on a  commercial document, which binds the TSP to the terms and conditions of  a GBL.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 102-118.35: 49 U.S.C. 13102, et seq., defines  additional transportation terms not listed in this section.  [65 FR 24569, Apr. 26, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004;  74 FR 30475, June 26, 2009]</p>
