                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to approval of a plan of operations, the operator shall be  required to file a suitable performance bond with satisfactory surety,  payable to the Secretary or his designee. The bond shall be conditioned  upon faithful compliance with applicable regulations, and the plan of  operations as approved, revised or supplemented. This performance bond  is in addition to and not in lieu of any bond or security deposit  required by other regulatory authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of a performance bond, an operator may elect to deposit  with the Secretary or his designee, cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S.  Government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities  shall be at least equal to the required sum of the bond. When bonds are  to serve as security, there must be provided to the Secretary a power of  attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that an approved plan of operations is revised or  supplemented in accordance with Sec. 9.40, the Regional Director may  adjust the amount of the bond or security deposit to conform to the  modified plan of operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The bond or security deposit shall be in an amount:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equal to the estimated cost of reclaiming the site, either in  its entirety or in phases, that has been damaged or destroyed as a  result of operations conducted in accordance with an approved,  supplemented, plan of operations; plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount set by the Superintendent consistent with the type of  operations proposed, to bond against the liability imposed by Sec.  9.51(a); to provide the means for rapid and effective cleanup; and to  minimize damages resulting from an oil spill, the escape of gas, wastes,  contaminating substances, or fire caused by operations. This amount  shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) for geophysical  surveys when using more than one field party or five thousand dollars  ($5,000) when operating with only one field party, and shall not exceed  fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for each wellsite or other operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an operator's total bond or security deposit with the  National Park Service amounts to two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)  for activities conducted within a given unit, no further bond  requirements shall be collected for additional activities conducted  within that unit, and the operator may substitute a blanket bond of two  hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for all operations conducted within  the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The operator's and his surety's responsibility and liability  under the bond or security deposit shall continue until such time as the  Superintendent determines that successful reclamation of the area of  operations has occurred and, where a well has been drilled, the well has  been properly plugged and abandoned. If all efforts to secure the  operator's compliance with pertinent provisions of the approved plan of  operations are unsuccessful, the operator's surety company will be  required to perform reclamation in accordance with the approved plan of  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within thirty (30) days after determining that all reclamation  requirements of an approved plan of operations are completed, including  proper abandonment of the well, the Regional Director shall notify the  operator that the period of liability under the bond or security deposit  has been terminated.
