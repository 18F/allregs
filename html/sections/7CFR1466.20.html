Applications may be accepted on a continuous  basis throughout the year.

NRCS may designate eligible watershed-wide projects that  effectively conserve water, using the following criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The project area has a current, comprehensive water resource  assessment,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The project plan has demonstrated effective water conservation  management strategies, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The project sponsors have consulted relevant State and local  agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If NRCS determines that the conservation benefits of two or more  applications for payments are comparable, NRCS may not assign a higher  priority to the application solely because it would present the least  cost to the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ranking score may not give preferential treatment to  applications based on size of the operation, income generated from the  operation, type of operation, or other factors not related to  conservation benefits to address a resource concern unless authorized in  this rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The ranking process will determine the order in which  applications will be selected for funding. The approving authority for  EQIP contracts will be NRCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> NRCS will make available to the public all information regarding  priority resource concerns, the list of eligible practices, payment  rates, and how EQIP is implemented in a State.</p>
