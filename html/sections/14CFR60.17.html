The sponsor of such an FSTD must comply with the other applicable  provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each FSTD qualified before May 30, 2008, no sponsor may use  or allow the use of or offer the use of such an FSTD after May 30, 2014  for flight crewmember training, evaluation or flight experience to meet  any of the requirements of this chapter, unless that FSTD has been  issued a Statement of Qualification, including the Configuration List  and the List of Qualified Tasks in accordance with the procedures set  out in the applicable QPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the FSTD qualification is lost under Sec. 60.27 and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Restored under Sec. 60.27 in less than (2) years, then the  qualification basis (in terms of objective tests and subjective tests)  for the re-qualification will be those against which the FSTD was  originally evaluated and qualified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Not restored under Sec. 60.27 for two (2) years or more, then  the qualification basis (in terms of objective tests and subjective  tests) for the re-qualification will be those standards in effect and  current at the time of re-qualification application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, any change  in FSTD qualification level initiated on or after May 30, 2008 requires  an evaluation for initial qualification in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A sponsor may request that an FSTD be permanently downgraded. In  such a case, the NSPM may downgrade a qualified FSTD without requiring  and without conducting an initial evaluation for the new qualification  level. Subsequent continuing qualification evaluations will use the  existing MQTG, modified as necessary to reflect the new qualification  level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the sponsor has appropriate validation data available and  receives approval from the NSPM, the sponsor may adopt tests and  associated tolerances described in the current qualification standards  as the tests and tolerances applicable for the continuing qualification  of a previously qualified FSTD. The updated test(s) and tolerance(s)  must be made a permanent part of the MQTG.  [Doc. No. FAA-2002-12461, 71 FR 63426, Oct. 30, 2006; Amdt. 60-2, 72 FR  59599, Oct. 22, 2007]</p>
