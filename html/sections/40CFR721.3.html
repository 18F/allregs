Examples include, but are not limited to, chemical protective clothing, aprons, hoods, chemical goggles, face splash shields, or equivalent eye protection, and various

types of respirators. Barrier creams are not included in this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Powder or dry solid form means a state where all or part of the substance would have the potential to become fine, loose, solid particles.</p><p class="depth0">Principal importer means the first importer who, knowing that a chemical substance will be imported for a significant new use rather than manufactured in the United States, specifies the chemical substance and the amount to be imported. Only persons who are incorporated, licensed, or doing business in the United States may be principal importers.</p><p class="depth0">Process for commercial purposes means the preparation of a chemical substance or mixture containing the chemical substance, after manufacture of the substance, for distribution in commerce with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the processor. Processing of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture containing the chemical substance is included in this definition.
