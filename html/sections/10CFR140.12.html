                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial  protection for each nuclear reactor for which the amount of financial  protection is not determined in Sec. 140.11, in an amount determined  pursuant to the formula and other provisions of this section: Provided,  That in no event shall the amount of financial protection required for  any nuclear reactor under this section be less than $4,500,000 or more  than $74,000,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The formula is:  x = B times P</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the formula:  x = Amount of financial protection in dollars. B = Base amount of financial protection. P = Population factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The base amount of financial protection is equal to $185 times  the maximum power level, expressed in thermal kilowatts, as authorized  by the applicable license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The population factor (P) shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. The area to be considered includes all minor civil  divisions (as shown in the 1950 Census of Population, Bureau of the  Census, or later data available from the Bureau) which are wholly or  partly within a circle with the facility at its center and having a  radius in miles equal to the square root of the maximum authorized power  level in thermal megawatts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. Identify all minor civil divisions according to the  same census which are in whole or in part within the circle determined  in Step 1. Determine the population of each such minor civil division  (according to the same census or later data available from the Bureau of  the Census). For each minor civil division, divide its population by the  square of the estimated distance to the nearest mile from the reactor to  the geographic center of the minor civil division: Provided, That no  such distance shall be deemed to be less than one mile. If the sum of  the quotients thus obtained for all minor civil divisions wholly or  partly within the circle is 1,000 or less, the population factor is 1.  If the sum of these quotients is more than 1,000 but not more than  3,000, the population factor is 1.2. If the sum of these quotients is  more than 3,000 but not more than 5,000, the population factor is 1.4.  If the sum of these quotients is more than 5,000 but not more than  7,000, the population factor is 1.6. If the sum of these quotients is  more than 7,000 but not more than 9,000, the population factor is 1.8.  If the sum of these quotients is more than 9,000 the population factor  is 2.0.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any case where a person is authorized under parts 50, 52, or  54 of this chapter to operate two or more nuclear reactors at the same  location, the total financial protection required of the licensee for  all such reactors is the highest amount which would otherwise be  required for any one of those reactors; provided, that such financial  protection covers all reactors at the location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except in cases where the amount of financial protection  calculated under this section is a multiple of   $100,000, amounts determined pursuant to this section shall be adjusted  to the next highest multiple of $100,000.
