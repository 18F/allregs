Eligibility may not be denied solely on the basis that the locomotive or locomotive engine owner used parts not manufactured or remanufactured by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, or had repairs not performed by the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A clear description of the components which will be affected by the remedy and a general statement of the measures to be taken to correct the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the adverse effects, if any, that an uncorrected nonconformity would have on the performance or operability of the locomotive or locomotive engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of the adverse effects, if any, that such nonconformity would have on the performance or operability of the locomotive or locomotive engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A description of the average effects, if any, that such nonconformity would have on the functions of other locomotive or locomotive engine components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A description of the procedure which the locomotive or locomotive engine owner should follow to obtain correction of the nonconformity.
