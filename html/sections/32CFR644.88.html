Such action will permit administrative jurisdiction to remain with the present Government agency for continued utilization not in conflict with the eventual purpose of the project. A copy of the request will be furnished to DAEN-REA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a withdrawal is requested, the BLM supervisor cannot grant a permit to use the area; however, permits can be obtained for survey and exploration purposes, since these do not involve construction or military use of the land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Necessary rights-of-way will be obtained under the authority of section 507, Pub.

Those cases in which occupants were dispossessed under the order of immediate possession, referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, will be given priority attention in all phases of the procedure set out herein, including preparation and submission of declaration of taking assemblies in appropriate instances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition of grazing rights. (i) Grazing rights in the public domain are granted pursuant to the provisions of a series of Congressional acts commonly referred to as the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. 315 et seq. Section 315q of this Act provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Whenever use for war or national defense purposes of the public domain or other property owned by or under the control of the United States prevents its use for grazing, persons holding grazing permits or licenses and persons whose grazing permits or licenses have been or will be cancelled because of such use shall be paid out of the funds appropriated or allocated for such project such amounts as the head of the department or agency so using the lands shall determine to be fair and reasonable for the losses suffered by such persons as a result of the use of such lands for war or national defense purposes. Such payments shall be deemed payment in full for such losses. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to create any liability not now existing against the United States.

It is emphasized that payments under this section are administrative; further that this section applies only to military projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon issuance of a real estate directive to acquire or terminate grazing rights in the public domain or other property owned or controlled by the United States and notification that the Government department controlling such lands has granted a right-of-entry or transferred the lands to the Departments of Army or Air Force, the Division or District Engineer will initiate action to acquire or terminate such grazing rights as authorized by the real estate directive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Appraisals will be prepared in accordance with subpart B and the guidelines set forth in Comptroller General Decision No. B-132774, dated October 9, 1957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Discussions with landowners concerning acquisition of a ranch unit will be conducted in accordance with the procedures for fee acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Offers will be prepared, accepted, and distributed as provided in Sec. 644.87.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Title procurement and title clearance relating to the acquisition of title to any fee lands within the ranch unit will be the same as in any other fee acquisition. In preparing title evidence covering leasehold interests, a search of the records will be made by the Division or District Engineer Office and ENG Form 909, Attorney's Preliminary Certificate of Title, will be prepared. In connection with the search of the records, it should be noted that Federal grazing privileges may be pledged or encumbered with mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acquisitions under provisions of relocation contracts. (1) When land or interests therein, including subordination of minerals, required for project purposes are acquired under the provisions of relocation agreements negotiated in accord with Section 73, ER 1180-1-1, it will be necessary to procure title evidence covering such land and interests. If the value of interests so acquired is not otherwise determinable for compliance with Sec. 664.84, said value will be determined by the Division or District Engineer by means of a memorandum appraisal to be retained in the tract file. While this type of acquisition does not involve the closing procedure set forth in Sec. 644.70, so much of the title assembly described as is applicable, plus an executed or certified true copy of the relocation contract, will be used in the examination and approval of the title. The disposition of final title assemblies will be governed by Sec. 644.71.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When land or interests therein, including subordination of minerals, required for project purposes are acquired under the provisions of relocation agreements negotiated in accord with Section 73, ER 1180-1-1, it will be necessary to procure title evidence covering such land and interests.

The authority to acquire land by exchange for military projects is provided in 10 U.S.C. 2672, and in the Military Construction Authorization Act passed each year. As an example sections 601 and 702, Pub. L. 95-82, August 1, 1977, the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1978, provides in part, that ``the authority to acquire real estate or land includes authority to make surveys and to acquire land, and interests in land (including temporary use), by gift, purchase, exchange of

Government-owned land, or otherwise.'' Title 10 U.S.C. 2662a-4 provides that a transfer of real property owned by the United States to another Federal agency or another military department or to a state must be reported to the Committees on Armed Services if the estimated value of the property is more than $50,000. A prerequisite to any acquisition by exchange is authority for the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Military.

OMB requests that each proposal to use Government-owned property in a land acquisition exchange be cleared with the appropriate Associate Director of OMB. Disposal actions where exchange through the authority of the General Services Administration or specific legislation is envisioned will be cleared with OMB prior to filing a disposal report pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2662. A draft letter to the Associate Director, Office of Management and Budget will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 stating the requirement for the new acquisition, the description of the property to be excessed, its estimated fair market value, and a justification for the exchange of that property as constituting its highest and best use. OMB clearance will be required before disposal reports outlining exchange proposals are filed with the Congress.</p><p class="depth0">Involuntary Acquisition by the United States</p>
