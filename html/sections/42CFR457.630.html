the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The amount of this quarter's grant award is based on the difference between a State's final allotment for the fiscal year, and the total of the grants for the first 3 quarters that were already issued in order to ensure that the total of all grant awards for the fiscal year are equal to the State's final allotment for that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount of the quarterly grant is determined on the basis of information submitted by the State (in quarterly estimate and quarterly expenditure reports) and other pertinent information. This information must be submitted by the State through the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System (MBES) for the Medicaid program, and through the Child Health Budget and Expenditure System (CBES) for the title XXI program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quarterly estimates.

This disposition of Federal funds may not be reported on the basis of estimates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional required information. A State must provide CMS with the following information regarding the administration of the title XXI program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and address of the State Agency/organization administering the program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer identification number (EIN); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State official contact name and telephone number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grant award--(1) Computation by CMS.

The grant award computation form shows the estimate of expenditures for the ensuing quarter, and the amounts by which that estimate is increased or decreased because of an increase or overestimate for prior quarters, or for any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Penalty reductions imposed by law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deferrals or disallowances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Interest assessments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mandated adjustments such as those required by Section 1914 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect of award. The grant award authorizes the State to draw Federal funds as needed to pay the Federal share of disbursements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Draw procedure. The draw is through a commercial bank and the Federal Reserve system against a continuing letter of credit certified to the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the State payee. (The letter of credit payment system was established in accordance with Treasury Department regulations--Circular No.1075.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> General administrative requirements.
