                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to any complaint (other than a complaint  alleging violation of the nondiscrimination provisions) that a State has  failed to use its allotment under a block grant in accordance with the  terms of the act establishing the block grant or the certifications and  assurances made by the State pursuant to that act. The Secretary is not  required to consider a complaint unless it is submitted as required by  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Complaints with respect to the health block grants must be  submitted in writing to either the Assistant Secretary for Health or:  For the preventive health and health services block grant, the Director,  Centers for Disease Control; for the alcohol and drug abuse and mental  health services block grant, the Administrator, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and  Mental Health Administration; for the maternal and child health services  block grant, the Administrator, Health Resources and Services  Administration. Complaints with respect to the social services block  grant must be submitted in writing to the Assistant Secretary for Human  Development Services. Complaints with respect to the low-income home  energy assistance program and the community services block grant must be  submitted in writing to the Director, Office of Community Services. (The  address for the Director, Center for Disease Control is 1600 Clifton  Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333. For each of the other officials cited  above the address is 200 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201.)  The complaint must identify the provision of the act, assurance, or  certification that was allegedly violated; must specify the basis for  the violations it charges; and must include all relevant information  known to the person submitting it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department shall promptly furnish a copy of any complaint to  the affected State. Any comments received from the State within 60 days  (or such longer period as may be agreed upon between the State and the  Department) shall be considered by the Department in responding to the  complaint. The Department will conduct an investigation of complaints  where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department will provide a written response to complaints  within 180 days after receipt. If a final resolution cannot be provided  at that time, the response will state the reasons why additional time is  necessary. Under the low-income home energy assistance program, within  60 days after receipt of complaints, the Department will provide a  written response to the complainant, stating the actions that it has  taken to date and, if the complaint has not yet been fully resolved, the  timetable for final resolution of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Department recognizes that under the block grant programs  the States are primarily responsible for interpreting the governing  statutory provisions. As a result, various States may reach different  interpretations of the same statutory provisions. This circumstance is  consistent with the intent of and statutory authority for the block  grant programs. In resolving any issue raised by a complaint or a  Federal audit the Department will defer to a State's interpretation of  its assurances and of the provisions of the block grant statutes unless  the interpretation is clearly erroneous. In any event, the Department  will provide copies of complaints to the independent entity responsible  for auditing the State's activities under the block grant program  involved. Any determination by the Department that a State's  interpretation is not clearly erroneous shall not preclude or otherwise  prejudice the State auditors' consideration of the question.
