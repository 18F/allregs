                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consular authority. Consular officers may, at their discretion,  accept for recording in the Miscellaneous Record Book of the office  concerned   unofficial documents such as deeds, leases, agreements, wills, and so  on. The object of this service is primarily to afford United States  citizens and interests the means of preserving, in official custody,  records of their business and other transactions where other suitable  facilities are not available locally for making such records. The  recording of unofficial documents is not a notarial service, strictly  speaking; however, the certifying of copies of documents thus recorded  is a notarial service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recording procedure. Generally, before accepting a document for  recording the consular officer should require satisfactory proof of its  genuineness. The document should be copied, word for word, in the  Miscellaneous Record Book. At the close of the record a statement that  it is a true copy of the original should be entered and signed by the  consular officer who copies or compares the record. In the margin of the  first page where the document is recorded, the consular officer should  note the following data:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By whom the document is presented for recording;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On whose behalf the service is requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date and hour of presentation for recording;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How the authenticity of the document was proved (where  appropriate); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The name of the person by whom recorded (in his proper  signature) and the name of the consular officer with whom compared (in  his proper signature).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certificate of recording. Ordinarily, a certificate of recording  need not be issued. The original document may simply be endorsed:  ``Recorded at (name and location of consular office) this ---------- day  of ------------------, 19----, in (here insert appropriate reference to  volume of Miscellaneous Record Book)''. Below the endorsement should  appear the notation regarding the service number, the Tariff item  number, and the amount of the fee collected. When a certificate of  recording is requested, the consular officer may issue it, if he sees  fit to do so. The certificate may be either entered on the document, if  space permits, or appended to the document as a separate sheet in the  manner prescribed in Sec. 92.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees. The fee for recording unofficial documents at a Foreign  Service post is as prescribed under the caption ``Copying and  Recording'' of the Tariff of Fees, Foreign Service of the United States  of America (Sec. 22.1 of this chapter). For purposes of assessment of  fees, the issuance of certificates of recording, when requested, shall  be regarded as part of the consular service of recording unofficial  documents, and no separate fee shall be charged for the certificate.</p>
