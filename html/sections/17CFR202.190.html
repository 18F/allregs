(1) Following submission of the PCAOB-approved budget to the Commission, such budget and budget justification, subject to any applicable exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, shall be made available to the public. Neither the Commission nor the PCAOB shall publish a preliminary budget, budget, budget justification, or any underlying materials in connection therewith,

until such time as the budget is approved by the PCAOB and submitted to the Commission for its approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Supplemental budgets shall be made public, following approval by the PCAOB and submission to the Commission, in the same manner as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission-approved budget shall be made available to the public at the time of such approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Waivers of rule provisions.
