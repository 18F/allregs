                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided by this section and Sec.  3.712, a  person entitled to receive section 306 or old-law pension on December  31, 1978, may elect to receive improved pension under the provisions of  38 U.S.C. 1521, 1541, or 1542 as in effect on January 1, 1979. Except as  provided by Sec.  3.714, an election of improved pension is final when  the payee (or the payee's fiduciary) negotiates one check for this  benefit and there is no right to reelection. Any veteran eligible to  make an election under this section who is married to a veteran who is  also eligible to make such an election may not receive improved pension  unless the veteran's spouse also elects to receive improved pension.  (Authority: Sec. 306(a)(1) of Pub. L. 95-588, 92 Stat. 2497)  [46 FR 11661, Feb. 10, 1981]</p>
