In order to calculate the actual dollars to transfer to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets, carriers will first determine the ``Targeted Revenue Differential'' that will be transferred to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets to reduce the ATS Charge to the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq). The Targeted Revenue Differential shall be applied only to the trunking and traffic sensitive baskets to the extent necessary to reduce the ATS charge to the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3 (qq), and shall not be applied to reduce the PCIs in any other basket or to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month, except as provided in Sec. 61.45(i)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of Sec. 61.45(i)(1)(i), Targeted Revenue Differential will be determined by adding together the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> R * (GDP-PI - X) for the traffic sensitive basket, trunking basket, and the CMT basket excluding CCL revenues; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> CCL Revenues * [(GDP-PI - X - (g / 2)] / [1 + (g / 2)]</p><p class="depth0">Where ``g'' is defined in Sec. 61.45(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until a tariff entity's ATS Charge equals the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3 (qq) for the first time, the Targeted Revenue Differential will be targeted to reduce the following rates for that tariff filing entity, in order of priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the residual per minute Transport Interconnection Charge, until that rate is $0.00; then</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the Information Surcharge, until that rate is $0.00; then</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the other Local Switching charges and Switched Transport charges until the tariff entity's ATS Rate equals the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq) for the first time. In making these reductions, the reductions to Local Switching rates as a percentage of total X-factor reductions must be greater than or equal to the percentage proportion of Local Switching revenues to the total sum of revenues for Local Switching, Local Switching Trunk Ports, Signalling Transfer Point Port Termination, Switched Direct Trunked Transport, Signalling for Switched Direct Trunked Transport, Entrance Facilities for switched access traffic, Tandem Switched Transport, and Signalling for Tandem Switching (i.e., Local Switching gets at least its proportionate share of reductions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After a price cap local exchange carrier reaches the Target Rate as set forth in Sec. 61.3(qq), the ATS Rate will be recalculated each subsequent Annual Filing. This process will identify the new ATS Charge for the new base period level. Due to change in base period demand and inclusion of new services for that annual filing, the absolute level of a tariff entity's ATS Charge may change. The resulting new ATS Charge level will be what that tariff entity will be measured against during that base period. For example, if a company whose target is $0.0055 reached the Target Rate during the 2000 annual filing, that level may change to $0.0058 in the 2001 annual filing due to change in demand and inclusion of new services. Therefore, it will be the $0.0058 average rate that the tariff entity will be measured against for all non-annual filings. Likewise, if that same company was at the Target Rate

during the 2000 filing, that level may change to $0.0053 average rate in the 2001 annual filing due to change in demand and inclusion of new services. In that case, it will be at the $0.0053 average rate that the tariff entity will be measured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A company electing a $0.0095 Target Rate will, in the tariff year it reaches the Target Rate, apply any Targeted Revenue Differential remaining after reaching the Target Rate to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month until the CCL charge is eliminated. In subsequent years, until the earlier of June 30, 2004 or when the CCL charge is eliminated, tariff filing entities with a Target Rate of $0.0095, or the portion of a filing entity consolidated pursuant to Sec. 61.48(o) that, prior to such consolidation, had a Target Rate of $0.0095, will reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month according to the following method:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing entity calculates the maximum allowable carrier common line revenue, as defined in Sec. 61.46(d)(1), that would be permitted in the absence of further adjustment pursuant to this paragraph;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing entity identifies maximum amount of dollars available to reduce Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month by the following:
(CMT revenue in a $0.0095 Area -CCL revenue in a $0.0095 Area) * (GDP-PI -X) + (CCL Revenue in a $0.0095 Area) * [(GDP-PI - X) - (g / 2)] / [1 + (g / 2)]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Average Price Cap CMT Revenue per Line month shall then be reduced by the lesser of the amount described in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section and the amount described in paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section, divided by base period Switched Access End User Common Line Charge lines.
