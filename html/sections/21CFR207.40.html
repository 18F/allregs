S. commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No drug may be imported or offered for import into the United States unless it is listed as required in subpart C of this part and manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed at a registered foreign drug establishment; however, this restriction does not apply to a drug imported or offered for import under the investigational use provisions in part 312 of

this chapter, or the investigational new animal drug use provisions in part 511 of this chapter, or to a component of a drug imported under section 801(d)(3) of the act.
