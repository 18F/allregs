Table 2 in paragraph (j) of this section identifies the chemical substances that must be tested under this section. For the chemical substances identified as ``Class 1'' chemical substances in Table 2 in paragraph (j) of this section, the purity of each chemical substance must be 99% or greater, unless otherwise specified in this section. For the chemical substances identified as ``Class 2'' chemical substances in Table 2 in paragraph (j), a representative form of each chemical substance must be tested. The representative form selected for a given Class 2 chemical substance should meet industry or consensus standards where they exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Am I subject to this section?
