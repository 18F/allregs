                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> You must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. You must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. You must meet the requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.8005 through 63.8025 (or the alternative means of compliance in Sec. 63.8050), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. (1) If an emission stream contains halogen atoms, and you use a combustion-based control device (excluding a flare) to meet an organic HAP emission limit, you must determine whether the emission stream meets the definition of a halogenated stream by calculating the concentration of each organic compound that contains halogen atoms using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.115(d)(2)(v), multiplying each concentration by the number of halogen atoms in the organic compound, and summing the resulting halogen atom concentrations for all of the organic compounds in the emission stream. Alternatively, you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec. 63.8105, is allowed at any time conditions require it to avoid unsafe conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compliance requirements for closed vent systems and control devices.If you use a control device to comply with an emission limit in Table 1, 2, or 5 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare), you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein. You may not use a flare to control halogenated vent streams or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions that are generated by combusting halogenated vent streams, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in Sec. 63.115(d)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions to the requirements specified in other subparts of this part 63--(1) Requirements for performance tests. The requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section apply instead of or in addition to the requirements for performance testing of control devices as specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conduct gas molecular weight analysis using Method 3, 3A, or 3B in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Measure moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission limits specified in Tables 1 through 6 to this subpart, you may use Method 320 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 63.997(c)(1) does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 150 days after the compliance date, as specified in Sec. 63.8075(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If you do not have a closed-vent system as defined in Sec. 63.981, you must determine capture efficiency using Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for all stationary process vessels subject to requirements of Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Design evaluation. To determine the percent reduction of a small control device, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63. You must establish the value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Periodic verification. For a control device with total inlet HAP emissions less than 1 ton per year (tpy), you must establish an operating limit(s) for a parameter(s) that you will measure and record at least once per averaging period (i.e., daily or block) to verify that the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continuous emissions monitoring systems. Each continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and according to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For any CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8, you must also comply with appendix F, procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you wish to use a CEMS other than a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 to measure hydrogen halide and halogen HAP before we promulgate a Performance Specification for such CEMS, you must prepare a monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 63.8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must determine the calibration gases and reporting units for TOC CEMS in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 9 or 15 requirements, determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a combustion device, calibrate the instrument on the predominant organic HAP and report the results as carbon (C1), and use Method 25A or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a noncombustion device, determine the predominant organic HAP using either process knowledge or

the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C1. Use Method 18, ASTM D6420-99, or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as C1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except that the schedule in Sec. 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the results of the performance evaluation must be included in the notification of compliance status report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data consistent with the data availability requirements specified in Sec. 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through (D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations in the manufacturing of a coating. Operating block averages may be used only for process vessel data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Continuous parameter monitoring. The provisions in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section apply in addition to the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must record the results of each calibration check and all maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in Sec. 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 uses the term a range or operating range of a monitored parameter, it means an operating limit for a monitored parameter for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an alternative to measuring pH as specified in Sec. 63.994(c)(1)(i), you may elect to continuously monitor the caustic strength of the scrubber effluent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Sections 63.998(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reporting. (i) When Sec. Sec. 63.8005 through 63.8025 reference other subparts in this part 63 that use the term periodic report, it means compliance report for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When there are conflicts between this subpart and referenced subparts for the due dates of reports required by this subpart, reports must be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Excused excursions, as defined in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63, are not allowed.
