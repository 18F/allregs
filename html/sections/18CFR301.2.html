The initial Exchange Period under this ASC methodology is

from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009.

The Base Period ASC escalated to a year(s) consistent with the Exchange Period.</p><p class="depth0">FERC Form 1. The annual filing submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, required by 18 CFR 141.1.</p><p class="depth0">Functionalization.
