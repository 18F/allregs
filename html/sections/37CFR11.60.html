                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Restrictions on reinstatement. An excluded, suspended or  resigned practitioner shall not resume practice of patent, trademark, or  other non-patent law before the Office until reinstated by order of the  OED Director or the USPTO Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition for reinstatement. An excluded or suspended  practitioner shall be eligible to apply for reinstatement only upon  expiration of the period of suspension or exclusion and the  practitioner's full compliance with Sec.  11.58. An excluded  practitioner shall be eligible to apply for reinstatement no earlier  than at least five years from the effective date of the exclusion. A  resigned practitioner shall be eligible to petition for reinstatement  and must show compliance with Sec.  11.58 no earlier than at least five  years from the date the practitioner's resignation is accepted and an  order is entered excluding the practitioner on consent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of reinstatement petition. An excluded, suspended or  resigned practitioner shall file a petition for reinstatement  accompanied by the fee required by Sec.  1.21(a)(10) of this subchapter.  The petition for reinstatement shall be filed with the OED Director. An  excluded or suspended practitioner who has violated any provision of  Sec.  11.58 shall not be eligible for reinstatement until a continuous  period of the time in compliance with Sec.  11.58 that is equal to the  period of suspension or exclusion has elapsed. A resigned practitioner  shall not be eligible for reinstatement until compliance with Sec.   11.58 is shown. If the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner is  not eligible for reinstatement, or if the OED Director determines that  the petition is insufficient or defective on its face, the OED Director  may dismiss the petition. Otherwise the OED Director shall consider the  petition for reinstatement. The excluded, suspended or resigned  practitioner seeking reinstatement shall have the burden of proof by  clear and convincing evidence. Such proof shall be included in or  accompany the petition, and shall establish:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner has the  good moral character and reputation, competency, and learning in law  required under Sec.  11.7 for admission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the resumption of practice before the Office will not be  detrimental to the administration of justice or subversive to the public  interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the suspended practitioner has complied with the provisions  of Sec.  11.58 for the full period of suspension, that the excluded  practitioner has complied with the provisions of Sec.  11.58 for at  least five continuous years, or that the resigned practitioner has  complied with Sec.  11.58 upon acceptance of the resignation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Petitions for reinstatement--Action by the OED Director granting  reinstatement. (1) If the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner  is found to have complied with paragraphs (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (c)(3) of this  section, the OED Director shall enter an order of reinstatement, which  shall be conditioned on payment of the costs of the disciplinary  proceeding to the extent set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment of costs of disciplinary proceedings. Prior to  reinstatement to practice, the excluded or suspended practitioner shall  pay the costs of the disciplinary proceeding. The costs imposed pursuant  to this section include all of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual expense incurred by the OED Director or the Office  for the original and copies of any reporter's transcripts of the  disciplinary proceeding, and any fee paid for the services of the  reporter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All expenses paid by the OED Director or the Office which would  qualify as taxable costs recoverable in civil proceedings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The charges determined by the OED Director to be ``reasonable  costs'' of investigation, hearing, and review. These amounts shall serve  to defray the costs, other than fees for services of attorneys and  experts, of the Office of Enrollment and Discipline in the preparation  or hearing of the disciplinary proceeding, and costs incurred in the  administrative processing of the disciplinary proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An excluded or suspended practitioner may be granted relief, in  whole or in part, only from an order assessing costs under this section  or may be granted an extension of time to pay these costs, in the  discretion of the OED Director, upon grounds of hardship, special  circumstances, or other good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Petitions for reinstatement--Action by the OED Director denying  reinstatement. If the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner is  found unfit to resume the practice of patent law before the Office, the  OED Director shall first provide the excluded, suspended or resigned  practitioner with an opportunity to show cause in writing why the  petition should not be denied. Failure to comply with Sec.  11.12(c)  shall constitute unfitness. If unpersuaded by the showing, the OED  Director shall deny the petition. The OED Director may require the  excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, in meeting the  requirements of Sec.  11.7, to take and pass an examination under Sec.   11.7(b), ethics courses, and/or the Multistate Professional  Responsibility Examination. The OED Director shall provide findings,  together with the record. The findings shall include on the first page,  immediately beneath the caption of the case, a separate section entitled  ``Prior Proceedings'' which shall state the docket number of the  original disciplinary proceeding in which the exclusion or suspension  was ordered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Resubmission of petitions for reinstatement. If a petition for  reinstatement is denied, no further petition for reinstatement may be  filed until the expiration of at least one year following the denial  unless the order of denial provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reinstatement proceedings open to public. Proceedings on any  petition for reinstatement shall be open to the public. Before  reinstating any excluded or suspended practitioner, the OED Director  shall publish a notice of the excluded or suspended practitioner's  petition for reinstatement and shall permit the public a reasonable  opportunity to comment or submit evidence with respect to the petition  for reinstatement.
