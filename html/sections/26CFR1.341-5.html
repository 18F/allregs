                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whether or not a corporation is a collapsible corporation shall be determined under the regulations of Sec. Sec. 1.341-2 and 1.341-3 on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in each particular case. The following paragraphs of this section set forth those facts which will ordinarily be considered sufficient to establish that a corporation is or is not a collapsible corporation. The facts set forth in the following paragraphs of this section are not exclusive of other facts which may be controlling in any particular case. For example, if the facts in paragraph (b) of this section, but not the facts in paragraph (c) of this section, are present, the corporation may nevertheless not be a collapsible corporation if there are other facts which clearly establish that the regulations of Sec. Sec. 1.341-2 and 1.341-3 are not satisfied. Similarly, if the facts in paragraph (c) of this section are present, the corporation may nevertheless be a collapsible corporation if there are other facts which clearly establish that the corporation was formed or availed of in the manner described in Sec. Sec. 1.341-2 and 1.341-3 or if the facts in paragraph (c) of this section are not significant by reason of other facts, such as the fact that the corporation is subject to the control of persons other than those who were in control immediately prior to the manufacture, construction, production, or purchase of the property. See Sec. 1.341-4 for provisions which make section 341 inapplicable to certain shareholders of collapsible corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following facts will ordinarily be considered sufficient (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section and paragraph (c) of this section) to establish that a corporation is a collapsible corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A shareholder of the corporation sells or exchanges his stock, or receives a liquidating distribution, or a distribution described in section 301(c)(3)(A),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon such sale, exchange, or distribution, such shareholder realizes gain attributable to the property described in subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At the time of the manufacture, construction, production, or purchase of the property described in subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph, such activity was substantial in relation to the other activities of the corporation which manufactured, constructed, produced, or purchased such property.
The property referred to in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph is that property or the aggregate of those properties which meet the following two requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The property is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the corporation or by another corporation stock of which is held by the corporation, or is property purchased by the corporation or by such other corporation which (in the hands of the corporation holding such property) is property described in section 341(b)(3), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> At the time of the sale, exchange, or distribution described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the corporation which manufactured, constructed, produced, or purchased such property has not realized a substantial part of the taxable income to be derived from such property.
In the case of property which is a unit of an integrated project involving several properties similar in kind, the rules of this subparagraph shall be applied to the aggregate of the properties constituting the single project rather than separately to such unit. Under the rules of this subparagraph, a corporation shall be considered a collapsible corporation by reason of holding stock in other corporations which manufactured, constructed, produced, or purchased the property only if the activity

of the corporation in holding stock in such other corporations is substantial in relation to the other activities of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The absence of any of the facts set forth in paragraph (b) of this section or the presence of the following facts will ordinarily be considered sufficient (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section) to establish that a corporation is not a collapsible corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a corporation subject to paragraph (b) of this section only by reason of the manufacture, construction, production, or purchase (either by the corporation or by another corporation the stock of which is held by the corporation) of property which is property described in section 341(b)(3)(A) and (B), the amount (both in quantity and value) of such property is not in excess of the amount which is normal--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of the business activities of the corporation which manufactured, constructed, produced, or purchased the property if such corporation has a substantial prior business history involving the use of such property and continues in business, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of an orderly liquidation of the business if the corporation which manufactured, constructed, produced, or purchased such property has a substantial prior business history involving the use of such property and is in the process of liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a corporation subject to paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the manufacture, construction, or production (either by the corporation or by another corporation the stock of which is held by the corporation) of property, the amount of the unrealized taxable income from such property is not substantial in relation to the amount of the taxable income realized (after the completion of a material part of such manufacture, construction, or production, and prior to the sale, exchange, or distribution referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) from such property and from other property manufactured, constructed, or produced by the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The following examples will illustrate the application of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 2, 1954, A formed the W Corporation and contributed $50,000 cash in exchange for all of the stock thereof. The W Corporation borrowed $900,000 from a bank and used $800,000 of such sum in the construction of an apartment house on land which it purchased for $50,000. The apartment house was completed on December 31, 1954. On December 31, 1954, the corporation, having determined that the fair market value of the apartment house, separate and apart from the land, was $900,000, made a distribution (permitted under the applicable State law) to A of $100,000. At this time, the fair market value of the land was $50,000. As of December 31, 1954, the corporation has not realized any earnings and profits. In 1955, the corporation began the operation of the apartment house and received rentals therefrom. The corporation has since continued to own and operate the building. The corporation reported on the basis of the calendar year and cash receipts and disbursements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Since A received a distribution and realized a gain attributable to the building constructed by the corporation, since, at the time of such distribution, the corporation has not realized a substantial part of the taxable income to be derived from such building, and since the construction of the building was a substantial activity of the corporation, the W Corporation is considered a collapsible corporation under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.341-5. The provisions of section 341(d) do not prohibit the application of section 341(a). Therefore, the distribution, if and to the extent that it may be considered long-term capital gain rather than ordinary income without regard to section 341, will be considered ordinary income under section 341(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event of the existence of additional facts and circumstances in the above case, the corporation, notwithstanding the above facts, might not be considered a collapsible corporation. See Sec. 1.342-2 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.341-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 2, 1954, B formed X Corporation and became its sole shareholder. In August 1954, the corporation completed construction of an office building. It immediately sold this building at a gain of $50,000, included this entire gain in its return for 1954, and distributed this entire gain (less taxes) to B. In June 1955, the corporation completed construction of a second office building. In August 1955, B sold the entire stock of X Corporation at a gain of $12,000, which gain is attributable to the second building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X Corporation is a collapsible corporation under section 341(b) for the following reasons: The gain realized through the sale of the stock of X Corporation was attributable to the second office building; the construction of that building was a substantial activity of X Corporation during the time of construction and, at the time of sale, the

corporation had not realized a substantial part of the taxable income to be derived from such building. Since the provisions of section 341(d) do not prohibit the application of section 341 (a) to B, the gain of $12,000 to B is, accordingly, considered ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2), except that the following facts are shown: B was the president of the X Corporation and active in the conduct of its business. The second building was constructed as the first step in a project of the X Corporation for the development for rental purposes of a large suburban center involving the construction of several buildings by the corporation. The sale of the stock by B was caused by his retiring from all business activity as a result of illness arising after the second building was constructed. Under these additional facts, the corporation is not considered a collapsible corporation. See Sec. 1.341-2 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.341-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 2, 1948, C formed the Y Corporation and became the sole shareholder thereof. The Y Corporation has been engaged solely in the business of producing motion pictures and licensing their exhibition. On January 2, 1955, C sold all of the stock of the Y Corporation at a gain. The Y Corporation has produced one motion picture each year since its organization and before January 2, 1955, it has realized a substantial part of the taxable income to be derived from each of its motion pictures except the last one made in 1954. This last motion picture was completed September 1, 1954. As of January 2, 1955, no license had been made for its exhibition. The fair market value on January 2, 1955, of this last motion picture exceeds the cost of its production by $50,000. A material part of the production of this last picture was completed on January 1, 1954, and between that date and January 2, 1955, the corporation had realized taxable income of $500,000 from other motion pictures produced by it. The corporation has consistently distributed to its shareholder its taxable income when received (after adjustment for taxes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the corporation is within paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the production of property, the amount of the unrealized income from such property ($50,000) is not substantial in relation to the amount of the income realized, after the completion of a material part of the production of such property and prior to sale of the stock, from such property and other property produced by the corporation ($500,000). Accordingly, the Y Corporation is within paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and is not considered a collapsible corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example (4) except that C sold all of his stock to D on February 1, 1954. On January 2, 1955, D sold all of the Y Corporation stock at a gain, the gain being attributable to the picture completed September 1, 1954, and not released by the corporation for exhibition. In view of the change of control of the corporation, the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not significant at the time of the sale by D, and the Y Corporation would be considered a collapsible corporation on January 2, 1955. See Sec. 1.341-2 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.341-5.</p>
