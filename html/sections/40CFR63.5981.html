Components of rubber tires include, but are not limited to, rubber  compounds, sidewalls, tread, tire beads, tire cord and liners. Other  components often associated with rubber tires but not integral to the  tire, such as wheels, inner tubes, tire bladders, and valve stems, are  not components of rubber tires or tire cord and are not subject to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or  group of stationary sources within a contiguous area and under common  control that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in  the aggregate, any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or  more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25  tons) or more per year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You own or operate a tire cord production affected source, but  the primary product produced at the affected source is determined to be  subject to another subpart under this part 63 as of the effective date  of that subpart (publication date of the final rule) or startup of the  source, whichever is later. In this case, you must determine which  subpart applies to your source and you must be in compliance with the  applicable subpart by the compliance date of that subpart. The primary  product is the product that is produced for the greatest operating time  over a 5-year period, based on expected utilization for the 5 years  following the compliance date or following initial startup of the  source, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your rubber tire manufacturing affected source is a research and  development facility whose primary purpose is to conduct research and  development into new processes and products, where such source is  operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel  and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in  commerce, except in a de minimis manner.</p>
