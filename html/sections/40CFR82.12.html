(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except for Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for Group VI, any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's consumption allowances or production allowances, and effective January 1, 1995, for all class I controlled substances any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's Article 5 allowances. After January 1, 2002, any essential-use allowance holder (including those persons that hold essential-use allowances issued by a Party other than the United States) (``transferor'') may transfer essential-use allowances for CFCs to a metered dose inhaler company solely for the manufacture of essential MDIs. After January 1, 2005, any critical use allowance holder (``transferor'') may transfer critical use allowances to any other person (``transferee'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim setting forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The type of allowances being transferred, including the names of the controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The group of controlled substances to which the allowances being transferred pertains;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The amount of allowances being transferred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The control period(s) for which the allowances are being transferred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the control period being transferred that the transferor holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The one percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded will be deducted from the transferor's production or consumption allowance balance (except for trades from transformers and destroyers to producers or importers for the purpose of allowance reimbursement). In the case of transferring essential use allowances, the amount of one tenth of one percent of the amount traded will be deducted from the transferor's allowance balance. In the case of transferring critical use allowances, the amount of one tenth of one percent of the amount traded will be deducted from the transferor's critical use allowance balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> The transferor must include a signed document from the transferee identifying the CFC MDI products that will be produced using the essential-use allowances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production, allowable imports and exports of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transferors of essential use allowances and critical use allowances, one tenth of one percent of the transferred amount).

When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator.

(1) Effective January 1, 2002, any metered dose inhaler company (transferor) may transfer essential-use CFCs to another metered dose inhaler company (transferee) provided that the Administrator approves the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transferee must submit a transfer claim to the Administrator for approval before the transfer can take place. The transfer claim must set forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of each controlled substance (CFC-11, CFC-12, or CFC-114) being transferred; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The specific metered dose inhaler products (i.e. the MDI drug product or active moiety) that the transferee plans to produce with the transferred CFCs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The country(ies) where the CFC metered dose inhalers produced with the transferred essential-use CFCs will be sold if other than in the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certification that the essential-use CFCs will be used in the production of essential MDIs. If the MDIs are to be sold in the United States, the certification must state that MDIs produced with the transferred essential-use CFCs are listed as essential at 21 CFR 2.125, and were approved by the Food and Drug Administration before December 31, 2000. If the MDIs produced with the essential-use CFCs are to be sold outside the United States, the transferee must certify that the metered dose inhalers produced with the essential-use CFCs are considered essential by the importing country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The transferor must submit a letter stating that it concurs with the terms of the transfer as requested by the transferee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Once the transfer claim is complete, and if EPA does not object to the transfer, then EPA will issue letters to

the transferor and the transferee within 10 business days indicating that the transfer may proceed. EPA reserves the right to disallow a transfer if the transfer request is incomplete, or if it has reason to believe that the transferee plans use the essential-use CFCs in anything other than essential MDIs. If EPA objects to the transfer, within EPA will issue letters to the transferor and transferee stating the basis for disallowing the transfer. The burden of proof is placed on the transferee to retain sufficient records to prove that the transferred essential-use CFCs are used only for production of essential MDIs. If EPA ultimately finds that the transferee did not use the essential-use CFCs for production of essential MDIs then the transferee is in violation of this subpart.
