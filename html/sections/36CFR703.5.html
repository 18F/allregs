This exemption may include, but is not limited to, business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, scientific or manufacturing processes or development information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which could constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Records pertaining to the use of the Library and of Library collections and subjects of inquiry are confidential and are not to be disclosed either to other readers, to members of the staff who are not authorized, or to other inquirers including officials of law enforcement, intelligence, or investigative agencies, except pursuant to court order or administratively by order of the Librarian of Congress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to anyone requesting such records after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section. A portion of a record shall be considered reasonably segregable when segregation can produce an intelligible record which is not distorted out of context, does not contradict the record being withheld, and can reasonably provide all relevant information.</p>
