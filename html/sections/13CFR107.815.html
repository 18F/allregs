                            <p class="depth0">You may purchase Debt Securities from Small Businesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Debt Securities are instruments evidencing a loan  with an option or any other right to acquire Equity Securities in a  Small Business or its Affiliates, or a loan which by its terms is  convertible into an equity position, or a loan with a right to receive  royalties that are excluded from the Cost of Money pursuant to  Sec. 107.855(g)(12). Consideration must be paid for all options that you  acquire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restriction on options obtained by Licensee's management and  employees. If you have outstanding Leverage or plan to obtain Leverage,  your employees, officers, directors or general partners, or the general  partners of the management company that is providing services to you or  to your general partner, may obtain options in a Financed Small Business  only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They participate in the Financing on a pari passu basis with  you; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA gives its prior written approval; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The options received are compensation for service as a member of  the board of directors of the Small Business, and such compensation does  not exceed that paid to other outside directors. In the absence of such  directors, fees must be reasonable when compared with amounts paid to  outside directors of similar companies.
