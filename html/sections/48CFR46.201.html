The type and extent of  contract quality requirements needed depends on the particular  acquisition and may range from inspection at time of acceptance to a  requirement for the contractor's implementation of a comprehensive  program for controlling quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As feasible, solicitations and contracts may provide for  alternative, but substantially equivalent, inspection methods to obtain  wide competition and low cost. The contracting officer may also  authorize contractor-recommended alternatives when in the Government's  interest and approved by the activity responsible for technical  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Although contracts generally make contractors responsible for  performing inspection before tendering supplies to the Government, there  are situations in which contracts will provide for specialized  inspections to be performed solely by the Government. Among situations  of this kind are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tests that require use of specialized test equipment or  facilities not ordinarily available in suppliers' plants or commercial  laboratories (e.g., ballistic testing of ammunition, unusual  environmental tests, and simulated service tests); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contracts that require Government testing for first article  approval (see subpart 9.3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as otherwise specified by the contract, required  contractor testing may be performed in the contractor's or  subcontractor's laboratory or testing facility, or in any other  laboratory or testing facility acceptable to the Government.</p>
