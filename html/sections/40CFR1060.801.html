If we revoke a  certificate or an exemption, you must apply for a new certificate or  exemption before continuing to introduce the affected equipment into  U.S. commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Round means to round numbers according to standard procedures as  specified in 40 CFR 1065.1001.</p><p class="depth0">Running loss emissions means unburned fuel vapor that escapes from  the fuel system to the ambient atmosphere while the engine is operating,  excluding permeation emissions and diurnal emissions. Running loss  emissions generally result from fuel-temperature increases caused by  heat released from in-tank fuel pumps, fuel recirculation, or proximity  to heat sources such as the engine or exhaust components.</p><p class="depth0">Sealed means lacking openings to the atmosphere that would allow a  measurable amount of liquid or vapor to leak out under normal operating  pressures or other pressures specified in this part. For example, you  may generally establish a maximum value for operating pressures based on  the highest pressure you would observe from an installed fuel tank  during continuous equipment operation on a sunny day with ambient  temperatures of 35 [deg]C. A fuel system may be considered to have no  measurable leak if it does not release bubbles when held underwater at  the identified tank pressure for 60 seconds. This determination presumes  the use of good engineering judgment; for example, it would not be  appropriate to test the fuel tank such that small leaks would avoid  detection by collecting in a cavity created by holding the tank with a  certain orientation. Sealed fuel systems may have openings for emission  controls or for fuel lines needed to route fuel to the engine.</p><p class="depth0">Small SI means relating to engines that are subject to emission  standards in 40 CFR part 90 or 1054.</p><p class="depth0">Structurally integrated nylon fuel tank means a fuel tank having all  the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The fuel tank is made of a polyamide material that does not  contain more than 50 percent by weight of a reinforcing glass fiber or  mineral filler and does not contain more than 10 percent by weight of  impact modified polyamides that use rubberized agents such as EPDM  rubber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The fuel tank must be used in a cut-off saw or chainsaw or be  integrated into a major structural member where, as a single component,  the fuel tank material is a primary structural/stress member for other  major components such as the engine, transmission, or cutting  attachment.</p><p class="depth2">Subchapter U means 40 CFR parts 1000 through 1299.</p><p class="depth2">Suspend has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. If we suspend a  certificate, you may not introduce into U.S. commerce equipment from  that emission family unless we reinstate the certificate or approve a  new one. If we suspend an exemption, you may not introduce into U.S.  commerce equipment that was previously covered by the exemption unless  we reinstate the exemption.</p><p class="depth2">Tare means to use a container or other reference mass to zero a  balance before weighing a sample. Generally, this means placing the  container or reference mass on the balance, allowing it to stabilize,  then zeroing the balance without removing the container or reference  mass. This allows you to use the balance to determine the difference in  mass between the sample and the container or reference mass.</p><p class="depth2">Test sample means the collection of fuel lines, fuel tanks, or fuel  systems selected from the population of an emission family for emission  testing. This may include certification testing or any kind of  confirmatory testing.</p><p class="depth2">Test unit means a piece of fuel line, a fuel tank, or a fuel system  in a test sample.</p><p class="depth2">Ultimate purchaser means, with respect to any new nonroad equipment,  the first person who in good faith purchases such new nonroad equipment  for purposes other than resale.</p><p class="depth2">Ultraviolet light means electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength  between 300 and 400 nanometers.</p><p class="depth2">United States has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30.</p><p class="depth2">U.S.-directed production volume means the amount of equipment,  subject to the requirements of this part, produced by a manufacturer for  which the manufacturer has a reasonable assurance that sale was or will  be made to ultimate purchasers in the United States.</p><p class="depth2">Useful life means the period during which new nonroad equipment is  required to comply with all applicable emission standards. See Sec.   1060.101.</p><p class="depth2">Void has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. In general this means  to invalidate a certificate or an exemption both retroactively and  prospectively.</p><p class="depth2">Volatile liquid fuel means any fuel other than diesel or biodiesel  that is a liquid at atmospheric pressure and has a Reid Vapor Pressure  higher than 2.0 pounds per square inch.</p><p class="depth2">We (us, our) means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency and any authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth2">Wintertime equipment means equipment using a wintertime engine, as  defined in 40 CFR 1054.801. Note this definition applies only for Small  SI equipment.  [73 FR 59298, Oct. 8, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23027, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
