                            <p class="depth0">When a new business is commenced the employer will necessarily be unable for a time to determine its annual dollar volume on the basis of a full 12-month period as described in Sec. Sec. 794.123 and 794.124. In many cases, it is readily apparent that the enterprise will or will not have the requisite annual dollar volume specified in the Act. For example, the new business may be so large that it is clear from the outset that the business will exceed the $1 million test of the exemption. In other cases, where doubt exists, the gross receipts of the new business during the first quarter year in which it has been in operation will be taken as representative of its annual dollar volume tests for purposes of determining its status under section 7(b)(3) of the Act in workweeks falling in the following quarter-year period. Similarly, for purposes of determining its status under the Act in workweeks falling within ensuing quarter-year periods, the gross receipts of the new business for the completed quarter-year periods will be taken as representative of its annual dollar volume in applying the annual volume tests of the Act. After the new business has been in operation for a full calendar or fiscal year, the analysis can be made by the methods described in Sec. Sec. 794.123 and 794.124.</p><p class="depth0">Sales Made Within the State</p>
