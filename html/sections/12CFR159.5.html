                            <p class="depth0">The amount that a Federal savings association (``you'') may invest  in a service corporation or any lower-tier entity depends upon several  factors. These include your total assets, your capital, the purpose of  the investment, and your ownership interest in the service corporation  or entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under section 5(c)(4)(B) of the HOLA, you may invest up to 3% of  your assets in the capital stock, obligations, and other securities of  service corporations. Any investment you make under this paragraph that  would cause your investment, in the aggregate, to exceed 2% of your  assets must serve primarily community, inner city, or community  development purposes. You must designate the investments serving those  purposes, which include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Investments in governmentally insured, guaranteed, subsidized or  otherwise sponsored programs for housing,   small farms, or businesses that are local in character;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Investments for the preservation or revitalization of either  urban or rural communities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Investments designed to meet the community development needs of,  and primarily benefit, low- and moderate-income communities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other community, inner city, or community development-related  investments approved by the OTS or the OCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the amounts you may invest under paragraph (a) of  this section, and to the extent that you have authority under other  provisions of section 5(c) of the HOLA and part 160 of this chapter, and  available capacity within any applicable investment limits, you may make  loans to any non-consolidated subsidiary, subject to the lending limits  in part 32 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``obligations'' includes  all loans and other debt instruments (except accounts payable incurred  in the ordinary course of business and paid within 60 days) and all  guarantees or take-out commitments of such loans or debt instruments.
