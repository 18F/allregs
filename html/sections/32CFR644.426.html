                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to FPMR, 101-47.303-1, any item of surplus land not  reported to GSA for disposal in accordance with Sec. Sec. 644.348  through 644.367 will be classified according to its highest and best  use, e.g., industrial, commercial, agricultural, or for disposal under  the special acts referred to above. Where required by the special acts,  classification will be coordinated with the interested Federal agency.  The classification will be recorded on ENG Form 1825 (Real Property  Classification), with sufficient information to justify the  classification. Surplus property may be reclassified from time to time  whenever such action is deemed appropriate. Based on its classification,  notice of the availability of surplus land for disposal will be given to  public agencies eligible to procure such property as provided in Sec.  644.427.</p>
