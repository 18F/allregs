Because a State law must contain provisions fully consistent with sections 202 and 203 of the Act, the Department shall make no payment under paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not the State is certified under section 3304(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In respect of any regular or extended compensation paid to any individual for any week if the State does not apply--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The provisions of the State law required by section 202(a)(3) and this part, relating to failure to accept work offered or to apply for work or to actively engage in seeking work or the provisions of State law required by section 202(a)(4) and this part, relating to terminating a disqualification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of the State law required by section 202(a)(5) and this part, relating to qualifying employment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In respect of any regular or extended compensation paid to any individual for any week which was not payable by reason of the provision of the State law required by section 202(c) and this part as determined by the Department with regard to each State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payments not to be reimbursed. The Department shall make no payment under paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not the State is certified under section 3304(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in respect of any regular or extended compensation paid under a State law--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(1) of the Act and this part, if the payment made was not sharable extended compensation or sharable regular compensation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(2)(A) of the Act, if the State is entitled to reimbursement for the payment under the provisions of any Federal law other than the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(2)(B) of the Act, if for the first week in an individual's eligibility period with respect to which Extended Benefits or sharable regular benefits are paid to the individual and the State law provides for the payment (at any time or under any circumstances) of regular compensation to any individual for the first week of unemployment in any such individual's benefit year; except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a State law which is changed so that regular compensation is not paid at any time or under any circumstances with respect to the first week of unemployment in any individual's benefit year, this paragraph (c)(3)

shall not apply to any week which begins after the effective date of such change in the State law; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a State law which is changed so that regular compensation is paid at any time or under any circumstances with respect to the first week of unemployment in any individual's benefit year, this paragraph (c)(3) shall apply to all weeks which begin after the effective date of such change in the State law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(2)(C) of the Act and this part, for any week with respect to which Extended Benefits are not payable because of the payment of trade readjustment allowances, as provided in section 233(d) of the Trade Act of 1974, and Sec. 615.7(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(2)(D) of the Act and this part, if the State does not provide for a benefit structure under which benefits are rounded down to the next lower dollar amount, for the 50 percent Federal share of the amount by which sharable regular or Extended Benefits paid to any individual exceeds the nearest lower full dollar amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As provided in section 204(a)(3) of the Act, to the extent that such compensation is based upon employment and wages in service performed for governmental entities or instrumentalities to which section 3306(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 3306(c)(7)) applies, in the proportion that wages for such service in the base period bear to the total base period wages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the payment made was not sharable extended compensation or sharable regular compensation because the payment was not consistent with the requirements of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 202(a)(3) of the Act, and Sec. 615.8 (e), (f), or (g);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 202(a)(4) of the Act, and Sec. 615.8(c); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 202(a)(5) of the Act, and Sec. 615.4(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the payment made was not sharable extended compensation or sharable regular compensation because there was not in effect in the State an Extended Benefit Period in accord with the Act and this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For any week with respect to which the claimant was either ineligible for or not entitled to the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effectuating authorization for reimbursement. (1) If the Department believes that reimbursement should not be authorized with respect to any payments made by a State that are claimed to be sharable compensation paid by the State, because the State law does not contain provisions required by the Act and this part, or because such law is not interpreted or applied in rules, regulations, determinations or decisions in a manner that is consistent with those requirements, the Department may at any time notify the State agency in writing of the Department's view. The State agency shall be given an opportunity to present its views and arguments if desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Department believes that reimbursement should not be authorized with respect to any payments made by a State that are claimed to be sharable compensation paid by the State, because the State law does not contain provisions required by the Act and this part, or because such law is not interpreted or applied in rules, regulations, determinations or decisions in a manner that is consistent with those requirements, the Department may at any time notify the State agency in writing of the Department's view. The State agency shall be given an opportunity to present its views and arguments if desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department shall thereupon decide whether the State law fails to include the required provisions or is not interpreted and applied so as to satisfy the requirements of the Act and this part. If the Department finds that such requirements are not met, the Department shall notify the State agency of its decision and the effect thereof on the State's entitlement to reimbursement under this section and the provisions of section 204 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Thereafter, the Department shall not authorize any payment under paragraph (a) of this section in respect of any sharable regular or extended compensation if the State law does not contain all of the provisions required by sections 202 and 203 of the Act and this part, or if the State law, rules, regulations, determinations or decisions are not consistent with such requirements, or which would not have been payable if the State law contained the provisions required by the Act and this part or if the State law, rules, regulations, determinations or decisions had been consistent with such requirements. Loss of reimbursement for such compensation shall begin with the date the State law was required to contain such provisions, and shall continue until such time as the Department finds that such law, rules and regulations have been revised or the interpretations followed pursuant to such determinations and decisions have been overruled and payments are made or

denied so as to accord with the Federal law requirements of the Act and this part, but no reimbursement shall be authorized with respect to any payment that did not fully accord with the Act and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A State agency may request reconsideration of a decision issued pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) above, within 10 calendar days of the date of such decision, and shall be given an opportunity to present views and arguments if desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Concurrence of the Department in any State law provision, rule, regulation, determination or decision shall not be presumed from the absence of notice issued pursuant to this section or from a certification of the State issued pursuant to section 3304(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Upon finding that a State has made payments for which it claims reimbursement that are not consistent with the Act or this part, such claim shall be denied; and if the State has already been paid such claim in advance or by reimbursement, it shall be required to repay the full amount to the Department. Such repayment may be made by transfer of funds from the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund to the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account in the Fund, or by offset against any current advances or reimbursements to which the State is otherwise entitled, or the amount repayable may be recovered for the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account by other means and from any other sources that may be available to the United States or the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compensation under Federal unemployment compensation programs. The Department shall promptly reimburse each State which has paid sharable compensation based on service covered by the UCFE and UCX Programs (parts 609 and 614 of this chapter, respectively) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85, an amount which represents the full amount of such sharable compensation paid under the State law, or may make advances to the State. Such amounts shall be paid from the Federal Employees Compensation Account established for those programs, rather than from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Combined-wage claims. If an individual was paid benefits under the Interstate Arrangement for Combining Employment and Wages (part 616 of this chapter) any payment required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be made to the States which contributed the wage credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interstate claims. Where sharable compensation is paid to an individual under the provisions of the Interstate Benefit Payment Plan, any payment required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be made only to the liable State.
