                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Restrictions to flood control works. Flood control works are designed and constructed to have appreciable and dependable protection in preventing damage from irregular and unusual rises in water levels. Structures built primarily for the purposes of channel alignment, navigation, recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement, land reclamation, habitat restoration, drainage, bank protection, or erosion protection are generally ineligible for Public Law 84-99 Rehabilitation Assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-flood related rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of flood control structures damaged by occurrences other than floods, hurricanes, or coastal storms will generally not be provided under Public Law 84-99.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintenance and deterioration deficiencies. Rehabilitation under Public Law 84-99 will not be provided for either Federal or non-Federal flood control projects that, as a result of poor maintenance or deterioration, require substantial reconstruction. All deficient or deferred maintenance existing when flood damage occurs will be accomplished by, or at the expense of, the non-Federal sponsor, either prior to or concurrently with authorized rehabilitation work. When work accomplished by the Corps corrects deferred or deficient maintenance, the estimated deferred or deficient maintenance cost will not be included as contributed non-Federal funds, and will be in addition to cost-sharing requirements addressed in Sec. 203.82. Failure of project sponsors to correct deficiencies noted

during Continuing Eligibility Inspections may result in ineligibility to receive Rehabilitation Assistance under Public Law 84-99.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Economic justification. No flood control work will be rehabilitated unless the work required satisfies Corps criteria for a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio, and the construction cost of the work required exceeds $15,000. Construction costs greater than $15,000 do not preclude the Corps from making a determination that the required work is a maintenance responsibility of the non-Federal sponsor, and not eligible for Corps Rehabilitation Assistance.</p>
