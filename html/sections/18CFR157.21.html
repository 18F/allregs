                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> LNG terminal facilities and related jurisdictional natural gas  facilities. A prospective applicant for authorization to site, construct  and operate facilities included within the definition of ``LNG  terminal,'' as defined in Sec. 153.2(d), and any prospective applicant  for related jurisdictional natural gas facilities must comply with this  section's pre-filing procedures and review process. These mandatory pre- filing procedures also shall apply when the Director finds in accordance  with paragraph (e)(2) of this section that prospective modifications to  an existing LNG terminal are modifications that involve significant  state and local safety considerations that have not been previously  addressed. Examples of such modifications include, but are not limited  to, the addition of LNG storage tanks; increasing throughput requiring  additional tanker arrivals or the use of larger vessels; or changing the  purpose of the facility from peaking to base load. When a prospective  applicant is required by this paragraph to comply with this section's  pre-filing procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prospective applicant must make a filing containing the  material identified in paragraph (d) of this section and concurrently  file a Letter of Intent pursuant to 33 CFR 127.007, and a Preliminary  Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) with the U.S. Coast Guard (Captain  of the Port/Federal Maritime Security Coordinator). The latest  information concerning the documents to be filed with the Coast Guard  should be requested from the U.S. Coast Guard. For modifications to an  existing or approved LNG terminal, this requirement can be satisfied by  the prospective applicant's certifying   that the U.S. Coast Guard did not require such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall not be filed until at least 180 days after the date that  the Director issues notice pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section of  the commencement of the prospective applicant's pre-filing process; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall contain all the information specified by the Commission  staff after reviewing the draft materials filed by the prospective  applicant during the pre-filing process, including required  environmental material in accordance with the provisions of part 380 of  this chapter, ``Regulations Implementing the National Environmental  Policy Act.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prospective applicant must provide sufficient information  for the pre-filing review of any pipeline or other natural gas  facilities, including facilities not subject to the Commission's Natural  Gas Act jurisdiction, which are necessary to transport regassified LNG  from the subject LNG terminal facilities to the existing natural gas  pipeline infrastructure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other natural gas facilities. When a prospective applicant for  authorization for natural gas facilities is not required by paragraph  (a) of this section to comply with this section's pre-filing procedures,  the prospective applicant may file a request seeking approval to use the  pre-filing procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request to use the pre-filing procedures must contain the  material identified in paragraph (d) of this section unless otherwise  specified by the Director as a result of the Initial Consultation  required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a prospective applicant for non-LNG terminal facilities is  approved to use this section's pre-filing procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application will normally not be filed until at least 180  days after the date that the Director issues notice pursuant to  paragraph (e)(3) of this section approving the prospective applicant's  request to use the pre-filing procedures under this section and  commencing the prospective applicant's pre-filing process. However, a  prospective applicant approved by the Director pursuant to paragraph  (e)(3) of this section to undertake the pre-filing process is not  prohibited from filing an application at an earlier date, if necessary;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application shall contain all the information specified by  the Commission staff after reviewing the draft materials filed by the  prospective applicant during the pre-filing process, including required  environmental material in accordance with the provisions of part 380 of  this chapter, ``Regulations Implementing the National Environmental  Policy Act.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial consultation. A prospective applicant required or  potentially required or requesting to use the pre-filing process must  first consult with the Director on the nature of the project, the  content of the pre-filing request, and the status of the prospective  applicant's progress toward obtaining the information required for the  pre-filing request described in paragraph (d) of this section. This  consultation will also include discussion of the specifications for the  applicant's solicitation for prospective third-party contractors to  prepare the environmental documentation for the project, and whether a  third-party contractor is likely to be needed for the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of the initial filing. A prospective applicant's  initial filing pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of the section for LNG  terminal facilities and related jurisdictional natural gas facilities or  paragraph (b)(1) of this section for other natural gas facilities shall  include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the schedule desired for the project including  the expected application filing date and the desired date for Commission  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For LNG terminal facilities, a description of the zoning and  availability of the proposed site and marine facility location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For natural gas facilities other than LNG terminal facilities  and related jurisdictional natural gas facilities, an explanation of why  the prospective applicant is requesting to use the pre-filing process  under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A detailed description of the project, including location maps  and plot plans to scale showing all major plant components, that will  serve as   the initial discussion point for stakeholder review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A list of the relevant federal and state agencies in the project  area with permitting requirements. For LNG terminal facilities, the list  shall identify the agency designated by the governor of the state in  which the project will be located to consult with the Commission  regarding state and local safety considerations.

Such notice shall designate the third-party contractor. The  pre-filing process shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of the  Director's notice, and the date of such notice shall be used in  determining whether the date an application is filed is at least 180  days after commencement of the pre-filing process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Director finds that a prospective applicant for  authority to make modifications to an existing or approved LNG terminal  has adequately addressed the requirements of paragraphs (a), (c) and (d)  of this section, the Director shall issue a notice making a  determination whether prospective modifications to an existing LNG  terminal shall be subject to this section's pre-filing procedures and  review process. Such notice shall designate the third-party contractor,  if appropriate. If the Director determines that the prospective  modifications are significant modifications that involve   state and local safety considerations, the Director's notice will state  that the pre-filing procedures shall apply, and the pre-filing process  shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of the Director's notice  in determining whether the date an application is filed is at least 180  days after commencement of the pre-filing process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a prospective applicant requests to use this section's pre- filing procedures and review for facilities not potentially subject to  this section's mandatory requirements, the Director shall issue a notice  approving or disapproving use of the pre-filing procedures of this  section and determining whether the prospective applicant has adequately  addressed the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this  section.
