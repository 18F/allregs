When an  employee travels directly from home to a temporary duty location outside  the limits of his or her official duty station, the time the employee  would have spent in normal home to work travel shall be deducted from  hours of work as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee who is offered one mode of transportation, and who  is permitted to use an alternative mode of transportation, or an  employee who travels at a time other than that selected by the agency,  shall be credited with the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actual travel time which is hours of work under this  section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated travel time which would have been considered hours  of work under this section had the employee used the mode of  transportation offered by the agency, or traveled at the time selected  by the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an agency  may prescribe a mileage radius of not greater than 50 miles to determine  whether an employee's travel is within or outside the limits of the  employee's official duty station for determining entitlement to overtime  pay for travel under this part. However, an agency's definition of an  employee's official duty station for determining overtime pay for travel  may not be smaller than the definition of ``official station and post of  duty'' under the Federal Travel Regulation issued by the General  Services Administration (41 CFR 300-3.1).
