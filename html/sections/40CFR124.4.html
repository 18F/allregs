The first step in  consolidation is to prepare each draft permit at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever draft permits are prepared at the same time, the  statements of basis (required under Sec. 124.7 for EPA-issued permits  only) or fact sheets (Sec. 124.8), administrative records (required  under Sec. 124.9 for EPA-issued permits only), public comment periods  (Sec. 124.10), and any public hearings (Sec. 124.12) on those permits  should also be consolidated. The final permits may be issued together.  They need not be issued together if in the judgment of the Regional  Administrator or State Director(s), joint processing would result in  unreasonable delay in the issuance of one or more permits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever an existing facility or activity requires additional  permits under one or more of the statutes covered by these regulations,  the permitting authority may coordinate the expiration date(s) of the  new permit(s) with the expiration date(s) of the existing permit(s) so  that all permits expire simultaneously. Processing of the subsequent  applications for renewal permits may then be consolidated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Processing of permit applications under paragraph (a) or (b) of  this section may be consolidated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may consolidate permit processing at his or her  discretion whenever a facility or activity requires all permits either  from EPA or from an approved State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator and the State Director(s) may agree  to consolidate draft permits whenever a facility or activity requires  permits from both EPA and an approved State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Permit applicants may recommend whether or not the processing of  their applications should be consolidated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except with the written consent of the permit applicant, the  Regional Administrator shall not consolidate processing a PSD permit  with any   other permit under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section when to do so  would delay issuance of the PSD permit more than one year from the  effective date of the application under Sec. 124.3(f).
