The following definition applies to this section: designated representative, means any commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard on board Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, and local, state, and Federal law enforcement vessels who have been authorized to act on the behalf of the Captain of the Port (COTP).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement. (1) This regulation will be enforced at all times in Section G and the Wilson Cove section of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section. Mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section before entering either of those sections (paragraphs (a)(7) and (8)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This regulation will be enforced at all times in Section G and the Wilson Cove section of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section. Mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section before entering either of those sections (paragraphs (a)(7) and (8)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This regulation will be enforced in Sections A through F of the safety zone described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section except when the Coast Guard notifies the public that enforcement of the zone in specified sections is temporarily suspended. Mariners need not obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to enter a zone section in which enforcement is temporarily suspended. At all other times, mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) before entering any of those sections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The COTP will provide notice of suspended enforcement by means appropriate to effect the widest publicity, including broadcast notice to mariners, publication in the local notice to mariners, and posting the schedule of restricted access periods by date, location and duration at http://www.scisland.org.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regulations. (1) The general regulations governing safety zones found in 33 CFR 165.23 apply to the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The general regulations governing safety zones found in 33 CFR 165.23 apply to the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mariners requesting permission to transit through any section of the zone may request authorization to do so from the Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) San Diego by either calling 619-545-4742 or establishing a VHF bridge to bridge radio connection on Channel 16. Immediately upon completing transit, the vessel operator must promptly notify the FACSFAC of safe passage through the safety zone. Failure to expeditiously notify FACSFAC of passage through the safety zone will result in a determination by the Navy that the vessel is still in the safety zone, thereby restricting the use of the area for naval operations. If the Navy determines that facilitating safe transit through the zone negatively impacts range operations, the Navy will cease this practice and enforce the safety zones in these two areas without exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All persons and vessels must comply with the instructions of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard Captain of the Port or the designated representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon being hailed by U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard patrol personnel by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means, the operator of a vessel must proceed as directed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The U.S. Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol and enforcement of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section by the U.S. Navy and local law enforcement agencies.
