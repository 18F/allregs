                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Procedure is  designed to assure that a commodity imported into the territory of those  countries participating in IC/DV procedures will not be diverted,  transshipped, or reexported to another destination except in accordance  with export control regulations of the importing country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exports. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require  the IC/DV procedure on proposed exports of defense articles to non- government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV  procedures. In such cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export  license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the original Import  Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the government  of the importing country. This document verifies that the foreign  importer complied with the import regulations of the government of the  importing country and that the importer declared the intention not to  divert, transship or reexport the material described therein without the  prior approval of that government. After delivery of the commodities to  the foreign consignee, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may  also require U.S. exporters to furnish Delivery Verification  documentation from the government of the importing country. This  documentation verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the  terms of the approved export license. Both the Import Certificate and  the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by the  foreign importer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Triangular transactions. When a transaction involves three or  more countries that have adopted the IC/DV procedure, the governments of  these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import Certificate.  This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate when the  applicant for the Import Certificate (the importer) states either (1)  that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the Import  Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the Import  Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the items will not be  imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3) that,  if the items are to be imported into the country issuing the Import  Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another  destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the  country of ultimate destination, must be shown on the completed Import  Certificate.
