                            <p class="depth0">An issuer offering or selling securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) and in accordance with section 4A of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d-1) and this part must file with the Commission and provide to investors and the relevant intermediary the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The name, legal status (including its form of organization, jurisdiction in which it is organized and date of organization), physical address and Web site of the issuer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The names of the directors and officers (and any persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) of the issuer, all positions and offices with the issuer held by such persons, the period of time in which such persons served in the position or office and their business experience during the past three years, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each person's principal occupation and employment, including whether any officer is employed by another employer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name and principal business of any corporation or other organization in which such occupation and employment took place.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to paragraph (b).

An issuer must provide a reasonably detailed description of any intended use of proceeds, such that investors are provided with enough information to understand how the offering proceeds will be used. If an issuer has identified a range of possible uses, the issuer should identify and describe each probable use and the factors the issuer may consider in allocating proceeds among the potential uses. If the issuer will accept proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, the issuer must describe the purpose, method for allocating oversubscriptions, and intended use of the excess proceeds with similar specificity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> A description of the process to complete the transaction or cancel an investment commitment, including a statement that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Investors may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the deadline identified in the issuer's offering materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The intermediary will notify investors when the target offering amount has been met;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an issuer reaches the target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it may close the offering early if it provides notice about the new offering deadline at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline (absent a material change that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment commitment); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the issuer upon closing of the offering and the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her investment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> A statement that if an investor does not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material change is made to the offering, the investor's investment commitment will be cancelled and the committed funds will be returned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> The price to the public of the securities or the method for determining the price, provided that, prior to any sale of securities, each investor shall be provided in writing the final price and all required disclosures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> A description of the ownership and capital structure of the issuer, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The terms of the securities being offered and each other class of security of the issuer, including the number of securities being offered and/or outstanding, whether or not such securities have voting rights, any limitations on such voting rights, how the terms of the securities being offered may be modified and a summary of the differences between such securities and each other class of security of the issuer, and how the rights of the securities being offered may be materially limited, diluted or qualified by the rights of any other class of security of the issuer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of how the exercise of rights held by the principal shareholders of the issuer could affect the purchasers of the securities being offered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The name and ownership level of each person, as of the most recent practicable date but no earlier than 120 days prior to the date the offering statement or report is filed, who is the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of the issuer's outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> How the securities being offered are being valued, and examples of methods for how such securities may be valued by the issuer in the future, including during subsequent corporate actions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The risks to purchasers of the securities relating to minority ownership in the issuer and the risks associated with corporate actions including additional issuances of securities, issuer repurchases of securities, a sale of the issuer or of assets of the issuer or transactions with related parties;

The term spousal equivalent means a cohabitant occupying a relationship generally equivalent to that of a spouse.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 1 to paragraph (r). For each transaction identified, disclose the name of the specified person and state his or her relationship to the issuer, and the nature and, where practicable, the approximate amount of his or her interest in the transaction. The amount of such interest shall be computed without regard to the amount of the profit or loss involved in the transaction. Where it is not practicable to state the approximate amount of the interest, the approximate amount involved in the transaction shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 2 to paragraph (r). For purposes of paragraph (r), a transaction includes, but is not limited to, any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> A discussion of the issuer's financial condition, including, to the extent material, liquidity, capital resources and historical results of operations;</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 1 to paragraph (s). The discussion must cover each period for which financial statements of the issuer are provided. An issuer also must include a discussion of any material changes or trends known to management in the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer subsequent to the period for which financial statements are provided.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 2 to paragraph (s). For issuers with no prior operating history, the discussion should focus on financial milestones and operational, liquidity and other challenges. For issuers with an operating history, the discussion should focus on whether historical results and cash flows are representative of what investors should expect in the future. Issuers should take into account the proceeds of the offering and any other known or pending sources of capital. Issuers also should discuss how the proceeds from the offering will affect the issuer's liquidity, whether receiving these funds and any other additional funds is necessary to the viability of the business, and how quickly the issuer anticipates using its available cash. In addition, issuers should describe the other available sources of capital to the business, such as lines of credit or required contributions by shareholders.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 3 to paragraph (s). References to the issuer in this paragraph and its instructions refer to the issuer and its predecessors, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> For offerings that, together with all other amounts sold under section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) within the preceding 12-month period, have, in the aggregate, the following target offering amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $100,000 or less, the amount of total income, taxable income and total tax, or the equivalent line items, as reported on the federal income tax returns filed by the issuer for the most recently completed year (if any), which shall be certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer to reflect accurately the information reported on the issuer's federal income tax returns, and financial statements of the issuer, which shall be certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete in all material respects. If financial statements of the issuer are available that have either been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the information reported on the federal income tax returns or the certifications of the principal executive officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> More than $100,000, but not more than $500,000, financial statements of the issuer reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. If financial statements of the issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the reviewed financial statements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than $500,000, financial statements of the issuer audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer; provided, however, that for issuers that have not previously sold securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)), offerings that have a target offering amount of more than $500,000, but not more than $1,000,000, financial statements of the issuer reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. If financial statements of the issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the reviewed financial statements.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 1 to paragraph (t). To determine the financial statements required under this paragraph (t), an issuer must aggregate amounts sold in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) within the preceding 12-month period and the offering amount in the offering for which disclosure is being provided. If the issuer will accept proceeds in excess of the target offering

amount, the issuer must include the maximum offering amount that the issuer will accept in the calculation to determine the financial statements required under this paragraph (t).</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 2 to paragraph (t). An issuer may voluntarily meet the requirements of this paragraph (t) for a higher aggregate target offering amount.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 3 to paragraph (t). The financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, statements of changes in stockholders' equity and notes to the financial statements. If the financial statements are not audited, they must be labeled as ``unaudited.'' The financial statements must cover the two most recently completed fiscal years or the period(s) since inception, if shorter.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 4 to paragraph (t). For an offering conducted in the first 120 days of a fiscal year, the financial statements provided may be for the two fiscal years prior to the issuer's most recently completed fiscal year; however, financial statements for the two most recently completed fiscal years must be provided if they are otherwise available. If more than 120 days have passed since the end of the issuer's most recently completed fiscal year, the financial statements provided must be for the issuer's two most recently completed fiscal years. If the 120th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be considered the 120th day for purposes of determining the age of the financial statements.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 5 to paragraph (t). An issuer may elect to delay complying with any new or revised financial accounting standard that applies to companies that are not issuers (as defined under section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a)) until the date that such companies are required to comply with such new or revised accounting standard. Issuers electing this accommodation must disclose it at the time the issuer files its offering statement and apply the election to all standards. Issuers electing not to use this accommodation must forgo this accommodation for all financial accounting standards and may not elect to rely on this accommodation in any future filings.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 6 to paragraph (t). An issuer required to provide information from a tax return under paragraph (t)(1) of this section before filing a tax return with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the most recently completed fiscal year may provide information from its tax return for the prior year (if any), provided that the issuer provides information from the tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year when it is filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (if the tax return is filed during the offering period). An issuer that requested an extension from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service would not be required to provide information from the tax return until the date the return is filed, if filed during the offering period. If an issuer has not yet filed a tax return and is not required to file a tax return before the end of the offering period, then the tax return information does not need to be provided.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 7 to paragraph (t). An issuer providing financial statements that are not audited or reviewed and tax information as specified under paragraph (t)(1) of this section must have its principal executive officer provide the following certification:</p><p class="depth0">I, [identify the certifying individual], certify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the financial statements of [identify the issuer] included in this Form are true and complete in all material respects; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the tax return information of [identify the issuer] included in this Form reflects accurately the information reported on the tax return for [identify the issuer] filed for the fiscal year ended [date of most recent tax return].</p><p class="depth0">[Signature and title].</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 8 to paragraph (t). Financial statement reviews shall be conducted in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the Accounting and Review Services Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A signed review report must accompany the reviewed financial statements, and an issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer's intended use of the review report in the offering. An issuer will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide reviewed financial statements if the review report includes modifications.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 9 to paragraph (t). Financial statement audits shall be conducted in accordance with either auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (referred to as U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards) or the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. A signed audit report must accompany audited financial statements, and an issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer's intended use of the audit report in the offering. An issuer will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide audited financial statements if the audit report includes a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 10 to paragraph (t). To qualify as a public accountant that is independent of the issuer for purposes of this part, the accountant must satisfy the independence standards of either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 17 CFR 210.2-01 of this chapter, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The public accountant that audits or reviews the financial statements provided by an issuer must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Duly registered and in good standing as a certified public accountant under the laws of the place of his or her residence or principal office; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In good standing and entitled to practice as a public accountant under the laws of his or her place of residence or principal office.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction 11 to paragraph (t). Except as set forth in Sec.  227.100(c), references to the issuer in this paragraph (t) and its instructions (2) through (10) refer to the issuer and its predecessors, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(u)</em> Any matters that would have triggered disqualification under Sec.  227.503(a) but occurred before May 16, 2016. The failure to provide such disclosure shall not prevent an issuer from continuing to rely on the exemption provided by section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) if the issuer establishes that it did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the existence of the undisclosed matter or matters;</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to paragraph (u). An issuer will not be able to establish that it could not have known of a disqualification unless it has made factual inquiry into whether any disqualifications exist. The nature and scope of the factual inquiry will vary based on the facts and circumstances concerning, among other things, the issuer and the other offering participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Updates regarding the progress of the issuer in meeting the target offering amount, to be provided in accordance with Sec.  227.203;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Where on the issuer's Web site investors will be able to find the issuer's annual report, and the date by which such report will be available on the issuer's Web site;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Whether the issuer or any of its predecessors previously failed to comply with the ongoing reporting requirements of Sec.  227.202; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)</em> Any material information necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.</p><p class="depth0">Instruction to Sec.  227.201. If disclosure provided pursuant to any paragraph of this section also satisfies the requirements of one or more other paragraphs of this section, it is not necessary to repeat the disclosure. Instead of repeating information, an issuer may include a cross-reference to disclosure contained elsewhere in the offering statement or report, including to information in the financial statements.</p>
