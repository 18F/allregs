The Notice of Receipt is provided to the Complainant, Complainant's representative, if applicable, and to the organizational unit through the appropriate EEO Officer and DCM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dismissals of complaints are governed by the notice requirements and procedures in 29 CFR 1614.106(e)(1) and 29 CFR 1614.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior to a request for a hearing in a case, the Department shall dismiss an entire complaint for any of the reasons provided in 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1) through (9), including a complaint that alleges dissatisfaction with the processing of a previously filed complaint; or where the Department, strictly applying the criteria in EEOC decisions, finds that the complaint is part of a clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process for a purpose other than the prevention and elimination of employment discrimination. A clear pattern of misuse of the EEO process requires:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidence of multiple complaint filings; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims that are similar or identical, lack specificity or involve matters previously resolved; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of circumventing other administrative processes, retaliating against the Department's in-house administrative processes or overburdening the EEO complaint system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the Director of EEO believes that some, but not all, of the claims in a complaint should be dismissed for the reasons provided in this section and 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(1) through (9), the Department shall notify the Complainant in writing of its determination, the rationale for that determination and that those claims will not be investigated, and shall place a copy of the notice in the investigative file. A determination under 29 CFR 1614.107(b)(1) that some claims should be dismissed is reviewable by an EEOC Administrative Judge if a hearing is requested on the remainder of the complaint, but is not appealable until final action is taken on the remainder of the complaint.</p>
