                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A power of attorney, pursuant to Sec.  1.32(b), may be revoked  at any stage in the proceedings of a case by the applicant or patent  owner. A power of attorney to the patent practitioners associated with a  Customer Number will be treated as a request to revoke any powers of  attorney previously given. Fewer than all of the applicants (or fewer  than all patent owners in a supplemental examination or reexamination  proceeding) may revoke the power of attorney only upon a showing of  sufficient cause, and payment of the petition fee set forth in Sec.   1.17(f). A patent practitioner will be notified of the revocation of the  power of attorney. Where power of attorney is given to the patent  practitioners associated with a Customer Number (Sec.  1.32(c)(2)), the  practitioners so appointed will also be notified of the revocation of  the power of attorney when the power of attorney to all of the  practitioners associated with the Customer Number is revoked. The notice  of revocation will be mailed to the correspondence address for the  application (Sec.  1.33) in effect before the revocation. An assignment  will not of itself operate as a revocation of a power previously given,  but the assignee may become the applicant under Sec.  1.46(c) and revoke  any previous power of attorney and grant a power of attorney as provided  in Sec.  1.32(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> may withdraw as attorney  or agent of record upon application to and approval by the Director. The  applicant or patent owner will be notified of the withdrawal of the  registered patent attorney or patent agent. Where power of attorney is  given to the patent practitioners associated with a Customer Number, a  request to delete all of the patent practitioners associated with the  Customer Number may not be granted if an applicant has given power of  attorney to the patent practitioners associated with the Customer Number  in an application that has an Office action to which a reply is due, but  insufficient time remains for the applicant to file a reply. See Sec.   41.5 of this title for   withdrawal during proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.
