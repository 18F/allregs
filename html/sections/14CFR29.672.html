Warning systems must not activate the control systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The design of the stability augmentation system or of any other automatic or power-operated system must allow initial counteraction of failures without requiring exceptional pilot skill or strength, by overriding the failure by moving the flight controls in the normal sense, and by deactivating the failed system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It must be show that after any single failure of the stability augmentation system or any other automatic or power-operated system--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rotorcraft is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved operating limitations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The controllability and maneuverability requirements of this part are met within a practical operational flight envelope (for example, speed, altitude, normal acceleration, and rotorcraft configurations) which is described in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The trim and stability characteristics are not impaired below a level
