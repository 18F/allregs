                            <p class="depth0">An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who  has compensated an Injured Person for Cerro Grande Fire related losses,  may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss under the CGFAA for the subrogated  claim. An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee may  file a Subrogation Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured  Party who received payment from the insurer or third party filed a  Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss may not be filed until the  insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee has made all  payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for  Cerro Grande Fire related losses under the terms of the insurance policy  or other agreement between the insurer or other party with the rights of  a subrogee and the Injured Person. By filing a Subrogation Notice of  Loss for any subrogated claim, the insurer or third party elects the  CGFAA as its exclusive remedy against the United States for all  subrogated claims arising   out of the Cerro Grande Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a  Subrogation Notice of Loss form furnished by OCGFC. FEMA will evaluate  subrogation claims on their merits. FEMA may reimburse insurers and  other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for reasonable  payments made to an Injured Party on or before October 25, 2000, which  exceeded or were not required by the terms of the insurance policy or  other agreement creating a right of subrogation. FEMA will not reimburse  insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for  payments made to an Injured Party after October 25, 2000 that exceeded  or are not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other  agreement creating a right of subrogation.</p>
