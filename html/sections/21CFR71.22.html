                                Sec. 71.22  Deception as a basis for refusing to issue regulations; deceptive use of a color additive for which a regulation has issued.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Commissioner shall refuse to issue a regulation listing a color additive, if in his judgment the data before him show that such proposed use would promote deception of the consumer or would result in misbranding or adulteration within the meaning of the act. Such a finding shall be by order published in the Federal Register subject to the filing of objections and a request for a hearing by adversely affected parties. The issuance of a regulation for a color additive authorizing its use generally in or on a food, drug, or cosmetic shall not be construed as authorization to use the color additive in a manner that may promote deception or conceal damage or inferiority. The use of a color additive to promote deception or conceal damage or inferiority shall be considered as the use of a color additive for which no regulation has issued pursuant to section 721(b) of the act, even though the regulation is effective for other uses.</p>
