                                Sec. 2526.55  What is the impact of the aggregate value of education   terms of service?

                            <p class="depth0">The aggregate value of education awards an individual has received  will not impact an individual's ability to serve in a subsequent term of  service, but will impact the amount of the education award the  individual may receive upon successful completion of that term of  service. If the award amount offered for the term of service has a value  that, when added to the aggregate value of awards previously received,  would exceed 2, upon successful completion of the term of service, the  individual will only receive that portion of the award having a value  for which the individual is eligible pursuant to Sec. 2527.10(g).
