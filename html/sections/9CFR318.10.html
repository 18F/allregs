The sausage may be stuffed in animal casings, hydrocellulose casings, or cloth bags. During any stage of treating the sausage for the destruction of live trichinae, except as provided in Method 5, these coverings shall not be coated with paraffin or like substance, nor shall any sausage be washed during any prescribed period of drying. In the preparation of sausage, one of the following methods may be used:</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 1. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than 3\1/3\ pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, sausage having a diameter not exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, measured at the time of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room not less than 20 days at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F., except that in sausage of the variety known as pepperoni, if in casings not exceeding 1\3/8\ inches in diameter measured at the time of stuffing, the period of drying may be reduced to 15 days. In no case, however, shall the sausage be released from the

drying room in less than 25 days from the time the curing materials are added, except that sausage of the variety known as pepperoni, if in casings not exceeding the size specified, may be released at the expiration of 20 days from the time the curing materials are added. Sausage in casings exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, but not exceeding 4 inches, in diameter at the time of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room not less than 35 days at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F., and in no case shall the sausage be released from the drying room in less than 40 days from the time the curing materials are added to the meat.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 2. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than 3\1/3\ pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, sausage having a diameter not exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, measured at the time of stuffing, shall be smoked not less than 40 hours at a temperature not lower than 80 [deg]F., and finally held in a drying room not less than 10 days at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F. In no case, however, shall the sausage be released from the drying room in less than 18 days from the time the curing materials are added to the meat. Sausage exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, but not exceeding 4 inches, in diameter at the time of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room, following smoking as above indicated, not less than 25 days at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F., but in no case shall the sausage be released from the drying room in less than 33 days from the time the curing materials are added to the meat.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 3. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than 3\1/3\ pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After admixture with the salt and other curing materials and before stuffing, the ground or chopped meat shall be held at a temperature not lower than 34 [deg]F. for not less than 36 hours. After being stuffed, the sausage shall be held at a temperature not lower than 34 [deg]F. for an additional period of time sufficient to make a total of not less than 144 hours from the time the curing materials are added to the meat, or the sausage shall be held for the time specified in a pickle-curing medium of not less than 50[deg] strength (salometer reading) at a temperature not lower than 44 [deg]F. Finally, sausage having a diameter not exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, measured at the time of stuffing, shall be smoked for not less than 12 hours. The temperature of the smokehouse during this period at no time shall be lower than 90 [deg]F.; and for 4 consecutive hours of this period the smokehouse shall be maintained at a temperature not lower than 128 [deg]F. Sausage exceeding 3\1/2\ inches, but not exceeding 4 inches, in diameter at the time of stuffing shall be smoked, following the prescribed curing, for not less than 15 hours. The temperature of the smokehouse during the 15-hour period shall at no time be lower than 90 [deg]F., and for 7 consecutive hours of this period the smokehouse shall be maintained at a temperature not lower than 128 [deg]F. In regulating the temperature of the smokehouse for the treatment of sausage under this method, the temperature of 128 [deg]F. shall be attained gradually during a period of not less than 4 hours.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 4. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding one-fourth of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than 2\1/2\ pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After admixture with the salt and other curing materials and before stuffing, the ground or chopped sausage shall be held as a compact mass, not more than 6 inches in depth, at a temperature not lower than 36 [deg]F. for not less than 10 days. At the termination of the holding period, the sausage shall be stuffed in casings or cloth bags not exceeding 3\1/3\ inches in diameter, measured at the time of stuffing. After being stuffed, the sausage shall be held in a drying room at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F. for the remainder of a 35-day period, measured from the time the curing materials are added to the meat. At any time after stuffing, if the establishment operator deems it desirable, the product may be heated in a water bath for a period not to exceed 3 hours at a temperature not lower than 85 [deg]F., or subjected to smoking at a temperature not lower than 80 [deg]F., or the product may be both heated and smoked as specified. The time consumed in heating and smoking, however, shall be in addition to the 35-day holding period specified.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 5. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than 3\1/3\ pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, the sausage shall be held for not less than 65 days at a temperature not lower than 45 [deg]F. The coverings for sausage prepared according to this method may be coated at any stage of the preparation before or during the holding period with paraffin or other substance approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 6. (A) Basic requirements. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not

less than 3.33 pounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage, excluding the weight of dry ingredients, shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After the curing mixture has been added, the sausage shall be held for two time periods, a holding period and a drying period. The holding period will be for a minimum of 48 hours at a room temperature not lower than 35 [deg]F. This holding period requirement may be fulfilled totally or in part before the drying period and then the remainder, if any, after the drying period or as an extension of the drying period. During the drying period, the sausage shall be held in a drying room at a temperature not lower than 50 (10.0 [deg]F. (10.0 [deg]C) for a period of time determined by Tables 3A, 3B, and 4. The length of the drying period, established in (c)(3)(i)(A), may be modified as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B) and (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3A--Sausage Drying Room Times by Method No. 6------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Days in</p><p class="depth0">drying</p><p class="depth0">Diameter of casing at time of stuffing \1\              room</p><p class="depth0">\2\------------------------------------------------------------------------Up to:</p><p class="depth0">1 inches...................................................       14</p><p class="depth0">1\1/2\ inches..............................................       15</p><p class="depth0">2 inches...................................................       16</p><p class="depth0">2\1/2\ inches..............................................       18</p><p class="depth0">3 inches...................................................       20</p><p class="depth0">3\1/2\ inches..............................................       23</p><p class="depth0">4 inches...................................................       25</p><p class="depth0">4\1/2\ inches..............................................       30</p><p class="depth0">5 inches...................................................       35</p><p class="depth0">5\1/2\ inches..............................................       43</p><p class="depth0">6 inches...................................................       50------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The drying room times for flattened or oval sausages shall use a</p><p class="depth0">diameter derived by measuring the circumference and dividing by 3.14</p><p class="depth0"><em>(pi)</em>.\2\ Drying room time may be modified as set forth in Tables 3B and 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reduction in Drying Room Time.

In the curing of hams and pork shoulder picnics, one of the methods below shall be used. For calculating days per pound, the establishment shall use the weight of the heaviest ham or picnic in the lot.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 1. The hams and pork shoulder picnics shall be cured by a dry-salt curing process not less than 40 days at a temperature no lower than 36 [deg]F. The products shall be laid down in salt, not less than 4 pounds to each hundredweight of product, the salt being applied in a thorough manner to the lean meat of each item. When placed in cure, the products may be pumped with pickle if desired. At least once during the curing process, the products shall be overhauled (turned over for the application of additional cure) and additional salt applied, if necessary, so that the lean meat of each item is thoroughly covered. After removal from cure, the products may be soaked in water at a temperature not higher than 70 [deg]F for not more than 15 hours, during which time the water may be changed once, but they shall not be subjected to any other treatment designed to remove salt from the meat except that superficial washing may be allowed. The products shall finally be dried or smoked at a time and temperature not less than a combination prescribed in Table 5 of Method No. 3.</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 2. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Method No. 3. (A) Curing. (Other than bag curing): Establishments shall cure hams and shoulders by using a cure mixture containing not less than 70 percent salt by weight to cover all exposed muscle tissue and to pack the hock region. Total curing time consists of a mandatory cure contact time and an optional equalization time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cure Contact Time. This is the cure contact period, during which the establishment shall keep exposed muscle tissue coated with the cure mixture at least 28 days but for no less than 1.5 days per pound of ham or shoulder. Overhaul is optional so long as the exposed muscle tissue remains coated with curing mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Equalization. The establishment may provide an equalization period after the minimum cure contact period in (B) above to permit the absorbed salt to permeate the product's inner tissues. Equalization is the time after the excess cure has been removed from the product at the end of the cure contact period until the product is placed in the drying room and the drying period begins. The total curing time (equalization plus cure contact) shall be at least 40 days and in no case less than 2 days per pound of an uncured ham or shoulder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Removing Excess Cure. After the required cure contact period, the establishment may remove excess cure mixture from the product's surface mechanically or by rinsing up to 1 minute with water, but not by soaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Bag Curing. Bag curing is a traditional ham curing technique in which the manufacturer wraps the ham and all of the cure mixture together in kraft paper then hangs them individually. The paper keeps the extra cure mixture in close contact with the product making reapplication of salt unnecessary, and it protects the product from mites and insects. Establishments may employ the bag curing method as an alternative to (A) through (D) above. An establishment which elects to use the bag curing method shall apply a cure mixture containing at least 6 pounds of salt per 100 pounds of uncured product. The establishment shall rub the curing mixture into the exposed muscle tissue, pack the hock region with the curing mixture, and use uncoated wrapping paper to wrap the product together with any remaining curing mixture. The bag cured product shall remain wrapped throughout the curing period and may or may not remain wrapped during the drying period. In any case, the curing period shall be at least 40 days but not less than 2 days per pound of an uncured ham or shoulder. After curing, the cured product shall be exposed to a drying time and temperature prescribed in Table 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Curing Temperature. During the curing period the establishment shall use one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The establishment shall control the room temperature at not less than 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) nor greater than 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) for the first 1.5 days per pound of an uncured ham or shoulder, and not less than 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) nor greater than 60 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C) for the remainder of the curing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The establishment shall monitor and record daily product temperature. The room

temperature need not be controlled but days on which the product temperature drops below 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) shall not be counted as curing time. If the product temperature exceeds 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) within the first period of 1.5 days per pound of an uncured ham or shoulder or if it exceeds 60 [deg]F (15.6 [deg]C) for the remainder of the curing period, the establishment shall cool the product back to the 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) maximum during the first period or 55 [deg]F (12.8 [deg]C) maximum during the remainder of the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The establishment shall begin curing product only between the dates of December 1 and February 13. The room temperature need not be controlled, but the establishment shall monitor and record daily room temperatures, and days in which the room temperature drops below 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) shall not be counted as curing time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Drying. After the curing period, establishments shall use one of three procedures for drying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The establishment shall subject the product to a controlled room temperature for a minimum time and minimum temperature combination prescribed in Table 5 or for a set of such combinations in which the total of the fractional periods (in column 4 of Table 5) exceeds 1.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establishments using uncontrolled room temperatures shall monitor and record the internal product temperature. The drying period shall be complete when, from the days which can be counted as curing time, one of the time/temperature combinations of Table 5 is satisfied or when the total of the fractional values for the combinations exceeds 1.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Establishments using uncontrolled room temperatures shall dry the product for a minimum of 160 days including the entire months of June, July, and August. This procedure is obviously dependent on local climatic conditions and no problem exists with respect to current producers who use this procedure. Future applicants shall demonstrate that their local monthly average temperatures and the local monthly minimum temperatures are equal to or warmer than the normal average temperatures and normal minimum temperatures compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for Boone, North Carolina, station 31-0977, 1951 through 1980.</p><p class="depth0">Monthly Temperatures ([deg]F) for Boone NC, 1951-1980----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Jan.

Circuit supervisors are authorized to approve for use in sausage smokehouses, drying rooms, and other compartments, such automatic recording thermometers as are found to give satisfactory service and to disapprove and require discontinuance of use, for purposes of the regulations in this subchapter, any thermometers (including any automatic recording thermometers) of the establishment that are found to be inaccurate or unreliable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The requirements for using the pooled sample digestion technique to analyze pork for the presence of trichina cysts are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The establishment shall submit for the approval of the Regional Director its proposed procedure for identifying and pooling carcasses, collecting and pooling samples, testing samples (including the name and address of the laboratory), communicating test results, retesting individual carcasses, and maintaining positive identification and clear separation of pork found to be trichina-free from untested pork or trichina-positive pork.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The establishment shall use the services of a laboratory approved by the Administrator for all required testing. Such approval shall be based on adequacy of facilities, reagents, and equipment, and on demonstration of continuing competency and reliability in performing the pooled sample digestion technique for trichinae.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The establishment shall sample no less than 5 grams of diaphragm muscle or tongue tissue from each carcass or no less than 10 grams of other muscle tissue. Samples may be pooled but a pool shall not consist of more than 100 grams of sample. Sampling and sample preparation are subject to inspection supervision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pork or products made from tested pork shall not be released as trichina free from the official establishment without treatment until the inspector in charge receives a laboratory report that the tested pork is free of trichina cysts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Approval of other tests for trichinosis in pork. The Administrator shall consider any additional analytical method for trichinosis upon petition by a manufacturer, and may approve that method upon the determination that it will detect at least 98 percent of swine bearing cysts present at a tissue density equal to or less than one cyst per gram of muscle from the diaphragm pillars at a 95 percent confidence level. Any such petitions shall be supported by any data and other information that the Administrator finds necessary. Notice of any approval shall be given in the Federal Register, and the approved method will be incorporated into this section.
