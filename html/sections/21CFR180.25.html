                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mannitol is the chemical 1,2,3,4,5,6,-hexanehexol (C6H14O6) a hexahydric alcohol, differing from sorbitol principally by having a different optical rotation. Mannitol is produced by one of the following processes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The electrolytic reduction or transition metal catalytic hydrogenation of sugar solutions containing glucose or fructose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fermentation of sugars or sugar alcohols such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol using the yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A pure culture fermentation of sugars such as fructose, glucose, or maltose using the nonpathogenic, nontoxicogenic bacterium Lactobacillus intermedius (fermentum).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d Ed. (1981), pp. 188-190, which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20418, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Continued uses of this ingredient are contingent upon timely and adequate progress reports of such tests, and no indication of increased risk to public health during the test period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this regulation do not exist or have been waived.
