                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (28  U.S.C. 3201(e)), a debtor who owns property which is subject to an  outstanding judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States generally  is not eligible to receive a disaster loan. The SBA Associate  Administrator for Disaster Assistance, or designee, may waive this  restriction as to disaster loans (except IDAP loans) upon a  demonstration of good cause. Good cause means a written representation  by you under oath which convinces SBA that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The declared disaster was a major contributing factor to the  delinquency which led to the judgment lien, regardless of when the  original debt was incurred; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The disaster directly prevented you from fulfilling the terms of  an agreement with SBA or any other Federal Government entity to satisfy  its pre-disaster judgment lien; in this situation, the judgment creditor  must certify to SBA that you were complying with the agreement to  satisfy the judgment lien when the disaster occurred; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other circumstances exist which would justify a waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The waiver determination by the Associate Administrator for  Disaster Assistance, or designee, is a final, non-appealable decision.  The granting of a waiver does not include loan approval; a waiver  recipient must then follow normal loan application procedures.
