                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for interlocutory appeal. Appeals from orders or rulings other than an initial decision shall be allowed only at the discretion of the Environmental Appeals Board. A party seeking interlocutory appeal of such orders or rulings to the Environmental Appeals Board shall file a motion within 10 days of service of the order or ruling, requesting that the Presiding Officer forward the order or ruling to the Environmental Appeals Board for review, and stating briefly the grounds for the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability of interlocutory appeal. The Presiding Officer may recommend any order or ruling for review by the Environmental Appeals Board when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The order or ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial grounds for difference of opinion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Either an immediate appeal from the order or ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding, or review after the final order is issued will be inadequate or ineffective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interlocutory review. If the Presiding Officer has recommended review and the Environmental Appeals Board determines that interlocutory review is inappropriate, or takes no action within 30 days of the Presiding Officer's recommendation, the appeal is dismissed. When the Presiding Officer declines to recommend review of an order or ruling, it may be reviewed by the Environmental Appeals Board only upon appeal from the initial decision, except when the Environmental Appeals Board determines, upon motion of a party and in exceptional circumstances, that to delay review would be contrary to the public interest. Such motion shall be filed within 10 days of service of an order of the Presiding Officer refusing to recommend such order or ruling for interlocutory review.</p>
