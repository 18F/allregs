                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Marketable quantity and allotment percentage. If the Secretary  finds, from the recommendation of the committee or from other available  information, that limiting the quantity of cranberries purchased from or  handled on behalf of growers during a crop year would tend to effectuate  the declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall determine and  establish a marketable quantity for that crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The marketable quantity shall be apportioned among growers by  applying the allotment percentage to each grower's sales history,  established pursuant to Sec. 929.48. Such allotment percentage shall be  established by the   Secretary and shall equal the marketable quantity divided by the total  of all growers' sales histories including the estimated total sales  history for new growers. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this  section, no handler shall purchase or handle on behalf of any grower  cranberries not within such grower's annual allotment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any crop year in which the production of cranberries is  estimated by the committee to be equal to or less than its recommended  marketable quantity, the committee may recommend that the Secretary  increase or suspend the allotment percentage applicable to that year. In  the event it is found that market demand is greater than the marketable  quantity previously set, the committee may recommend that the Secretary  increase such quantity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance of annual allotments. The committee shall require all  growers to qualify for such allotment by filing with the committee a  form wherein growers include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of acreage which will be harvested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of any lease agreement covering cranberry acreage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name of the handler(s) to whom their annual allotment will  be delivered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such other information as may be necessary for the  implementation and operation of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the  approval of the Secretary, the committee shall issue to each grower an  annual allotment determined by applying the allotment percentage  established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to the grower's  sales history.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the  approval of the Secretary, in which an allotment percentage is  established by the Secretary, the committee shall notify each handler of  the annual allotment that can be handled for each grower whose total  crop will be delivered to that handler. In cases where a grower delivers  a crop to more than one handler, the grower must specify how the annual  allotment will be apportioned among the handlers. If a grower does not  specify how their annual allotment is to be apportioned among the  handlers, the Committee will apportion such annual allotment equally  among those handlers they are delivering their crop to.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Growers who do not produce cranberries equal to their computed  annual allotment shall transfer their unused allotment to such growers'  handlers unless it is transferred to another grower in accordance with  Sec. 929.50(b) or if it is not assigned in accordance with paragraph  (i) of this section. The handler shall equitably allocate the unused  annual allotment to growers with excess cranberries who deliver to such  handler. Unused annual allotment remaining after all such transfers have  occurred shall be reported and transferred to the committee by such date  as established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Handlers who receive cranberries more than the sum of their  growers' annual allotments have ``excess cranberries,'' pursuant to  Sec. 929.59, and shall so notify the committee. Handlers who have  remaining unused allotment pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section are  ``deficient'' and shall so notify the committee. The committee shall  allocate unused allotment to all handlers having excess cranberries,  proportional to each handler's total allotment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Growers who decide not to grow a crop, during any crop year in  which a volume regulation is in effect, may choose not to assign their  allotment to a handler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary,  rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of  this section.
