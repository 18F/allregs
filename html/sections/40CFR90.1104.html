                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer must furnish or cause to be furnished to the  ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine written instructions for  the maintenance needed to assure proper functioning of the emission  control system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer must provide in boldface type on the first page  of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance,  replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may  be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The instructions under paragraph (b) of this section will not  include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection  with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or  service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase  agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such  instructions also will not directly or indirectly distinguish between  service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer or any  other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a  commercial relationship and service performed by independent nonroad  engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial  relationship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The prohibition of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived  by the Administrator if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine  will function properly only if the component or service so identified is  used in connection with such engine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement  respecting the cost or value of emission control devices or systems, the  manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value  attributed to these devices or systems by the Secretary of Labor  (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and  his or her representatives, has the same access for this purpose to the  books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the  Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of   assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.
