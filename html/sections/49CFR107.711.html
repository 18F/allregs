                            <p class="depth0">An application may be withdrawn at any time before a decision to grant or deny it is made. Withdrawal of an application does not authorize the removal of any related records from the PHMSA dockets or files. Applications that are eligible for confidential treatment under Sec. 105.30 will remain confidential after the application is withdrawn. The duration of this confidential treatment for trade secrets and commercial or financial information is indefinite, unless the party requesting the confidential treatment of the materials notifies the Associate Administrator that the confidential treatment is no longer required.
