                            <p class="depth0">This subpart applies to certain biological products that have been  studied for their safety and efficacy in ameliorating or preventing  serious or life-threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or  permanently disabling toxic biological, chemical, radiological, or  nuclear substances. This subpart applies only to those biological  products for which: Definitive human efficacy studies cannot be  conducted because it would be unethical to deliberately expose healthy  human volunteers to a lethal or permanently disabling toxic biological,  chemical, radiological, or nuclear substance; and field trials to study  the product's efficacy after an accidental or hostile exposure have not  been feasible. This subpart does not apply to products that can be  approved based on efficacy standards described elsewhere in FDA's  regulations (e.g., accelerated approval based on surrogate markers or  clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity), nor  does it address the safety evaluation for the products to which it does  apply.</p>
