Formulation data shall be used to identify VHAP present in the coating. The EPA Method 311 shall then be used to quantify those VHAP identified through formulation data. The EPA Method 311 shall not be used to quantify HAP such as styrene and formaldehyde that are emitted during the cure. The EPA Method 24 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to determine the solids content by weight and the density of coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a coating does not release VOC or HAP byproducts during the cure, for example, all VOC and HAP present in the coating is solvent, then batch formulation information shall be accepted. The owner or operator of an affected source may request approval from the Administrator to use an alternative method for determining the VHAP content of the coating. In the event of any inconsistency between the EPA Method 24 or Method 311 test data and a facility's formulation data, that is, if the EPA Method 24/311 value is higher, the EPA Method 24/311 test shall govern unless after consultation, a regulated source could demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data were correct. Sampling procedures shall follow the guidelines presented in ``Standard Procedures for Collection of Coating and Ink Samples for VOC Content Analysis by Reference Method 24 and Reference Method 24A,'' EPA-340/1-91-010.
