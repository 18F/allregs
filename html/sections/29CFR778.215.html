                                Sec. 778.215  Conditions for exclusion of benefit-plan contributions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. In order for an employer's contribution to  qualify for exclusion from the regular rate under section 7(e)(4) of the  Act the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contributions must be made pursuant to a specific plan or  program adopted by the employer, or by contract as a result of  collective bargaining, and communicated to the employees. This may be  either a company-financed plan or an employer-employee contributory  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary purpose of the plan must be to provide  systematically for the payment of benefits to employees on account of  death, disability, advanced age, retirement, illness, medical expenses,  hospitalization, and the like.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a plan or trust, either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The benefits must be specified or definitely determinable on an  actuarial basis; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There must be both a definite formula for determining the  amount to be contributed by the employer and a definite formula for  determining the benefits for each of the employees participating in the  plan; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There must be both a formula for determining the amount to be  contributed by the employer and a provision for determining the  individual benefits by a method which is consistent with the purposes of  the plan or trust under section 7(e)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Note: The requirements in paragraphs (a)(3) (ii) and (iii) of  this section for a formula for determining the amount to be contributed  by the employer may be met by a formula which requires a specific and  substantial minimum contribution and which provides that the employer  may add somewhat to that amount within specified limits; provided,  however, that there is a reasonable relationship between the specified  minimum and maximum contributions. Thus, formulas providing for a  minimum contribution of 10 percent of profits and giving the employer  discretion to add to that amount up to 20 percent of profits, or for a  minimum contribution of 5 percent of compensation and discretion to  increase up to a maximum of 15 percent of compensation, would meet the  requirement. However, a plan which provides for insignificant minimum  contributions and permits a variation so great that, for all practical  purposes, the formula becomes meaningless as a measure of contributions,  would not meet the requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer's contributions must be paid irrevocably to a  trustee or third person pursuant to an insurance agreement, trust or  other funded arrangement. The trustee must assume the usual fiduciary  responsibilities imposed upon trustees by applicable law. The trust or  fund must be set up in such a way that in no event will the employer be  able to recapture any of the contributions paid in nor in any way divert  the funds to his own use or benefit. (It should also be noted that in  the case of joint employer-employee contributory plans, where the  employee contributions are not paid over to a third person or to a  trustee unaffiliated with the employer, violations of the Act may result  if the employee contributions cut into the required minimum or overtime  rates. See part 531 of this chapter.) Although an employer's  contributions made to a trustee or third person pursuant to a benefit  plan must be irrevocably made, this does not prevent return to the  employer of sums which he had paid in excess of the contributions  actually called for by the plan, as where such excess payments result  from error or from the necessity of marking payments to cover the  estimated cost of contributions at a time when the exact amount of the  necessary contributions under the plan is not yet ascertained. For  example, a benefit plan may provide for definite insurance benefits for  employees in the event of the happening of a specified contingency such  as death, sickness, accident, etc., and may provide that the cost of  such definite benefits, either in full or any balance in excess of  specified employee contributions, will be borne by the employer. In such  a case the return by the   insurance company to the employer of sums paid by him in excess of the  amount required to provide the benefits which, under the plan, are to be  provided through contributions by the employer, will not be deemed a  recapture or diversion by the employer of contributions made pursuant to  the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The plan must not give an employee the right to assign his  benefits under the plan nor the option to receive any part of the  employer's contributions in cash instead of the benefits under the plan:  Provided, however, That if a plan otherwise qualified as a bona fide  benefit plan under section 7(e)(4) of the Act, it will still be regarded  as a bona fide plan even though it provides, as an incidental part  thereof, for the payment to an employee in cash of all or a part of the  amount standing to his credit (i) at the time of the severance of the  employment relation due to causes other than retirement, disability, or  death, or (ii) upon proper termination of the plan, or (iii) during the  course of his employment under circumstances specified in the plan and  not inconsistent with the general purposes of the plan to provide the  benefits described in section 7(e)(4) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plans under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Where  the benefit plan or trust has been approved by the Bureau of Internal  Revenue as satisfying the requirements of section 401(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the plan or  trust will be considered to meet the conditions specified in paragraphs  (a)(1), (4), and (5) of this section.
