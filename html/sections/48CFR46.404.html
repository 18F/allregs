These situations include those listed in 46.402 and contracts for items having critical applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Detailed Government inspection may be limited to those characteristics that are special or likely to cause harm to personnel or property. When repetitive purchases of the same item are made from the same manufacturer with a history of defect-free work, Government inspection may be reduced to a periodic check of occasional purchases.
