                            <p class="depth0">OPM may establish or approve medical standards for a Governmentwide occupation (i.e., an occupation common to more than one agency). An agency may establish medical standards for positions that predominate in that agency (i.e., where the agency has 50 percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be justified on the basis that the duties of the position are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status or fitness because the nature of the positions involve a high degree of responsibility toward the public or sensitive national security concerns. The rationale for establishing the standard must be documented. Standards established by OPM or an agency must be:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Established by written directive and uniformly applied,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directly related to the actual requirements of the position.
