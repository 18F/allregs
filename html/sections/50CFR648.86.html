                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in Sec. 648.17 or elsewhere in this part, the following possession restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Haddock--(1) NE multispecies common pool vessels. Haddock possession restrictions for such vessels may be implemented through Regional Administrator authority, as specified in paragraph (r) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scallop dredge vessels. (i) No person owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel issued a NE multispecies permit may land haddock from, or possess haddock on board, a scallop dredge vessel from January 1 through June 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No person owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel without an NE multispecies permit may possess haddock in, or harvested from, the EEZ from January 1 through June 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unless otherwise authorized by the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, scallop dredge vessels or persons owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel that is fishing under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53 may land or possess on board up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of haddock, except as specified in Sec. 648.88(c), provided that the vessel has at least one standard tote on board. This restriction does not apply to vessels also issued limited access NE multispecies permits that are fishing under a multispecies DAS. Haddock on board a vessel subject to this possession limit must be separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily available for inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> Incidental catch allowance for some Atlantic herring vessels. A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared herring trip, regardless of gear or area fished, or a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 648.80(d), may only possess and land haddock, in accordance with requirements specified in Sec. 648.80(d) and (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incidental catch allowance for some Atlantic herring vessels. A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared herring trip, regardless of gear or area fished, or a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 648.80(d), may only possess and land haddock, in accordance with requirements specified in Sec. 648.80(d) and (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Haddock incidental catch cap. (A)(1) When the Regional Administrator has determined that the incidental catch allowance for a given haddock stock, as specified in Sec. 648.85(d), has been caught, no vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear in the applicable stock area, i.e., the Herring GOM Haddock Accountability Measure (AM) Area or Herring GB Haddock AM Area, as defined in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(2) and (3) of this section, may fish for, possess, or land herring in excess of 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) per trip in or from that area, unless all herring possessed and landed by the vessel were caught outside the applicable AM Area and the vessel's gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2 while transiting the AM Area. Upon this determination, the haddock possession limit is reduced to 0 lb (0 kg) for a vessel issued a Federal Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear or for a vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit fishing on a declared herring trip, regardless of area fished or gear used, in the applicable AM area, unless the vessel also possesses a NE multispecies permit and is operating on a declared (consistent with Sec. 648.10(g)) NE multispecies trip. In making this determination, the Regional Administrator shall use haddock catches observed by NMFS-approved observers by herring vessel trips using midwater trawl gear in Management Areas 1A, 1B, and/or 3, as defined in Sec. 648.200(f)(1) and (3), expanded to an estimate of total haddock catch for all such trips in a given haddock stock area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Herring GOM Haddock Accountability Measure Area.

A vessel fishing outside and inside of the U.S./Canada Management Area on the same trip is subject to the more restrictive yellowtail flounder trip limit (i.e., that specified by this paragraph (g) or Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iv)(C)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> GB yellowtail flounder landing limit. Unless otherwise restricted under this part, a common pool vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS, a limited access Handgear A permit, an open access Handgear B permit, or a monkfish limited access permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions, and fishing in the U.S./Canada Management Area defined in Sec. 648.85(a)(1) is subject to the GB yellowtail flounder limit described in paragraph Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(iv)(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Other possession restrictions. Vessels are subject to any other applicable possession limit restrictions of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offloading requirement for vessels possessing species regulated by a daily possession limit. A vessel that has ended a trip as specified in Sec. 648.10(e)(2)(iii) or (h)(5) that possesses on board species regulated by a daily possession limit

(i.e., pounds per DAS), as specified at Sec. 648.85 or Sec. 648.86, must offload species in excess of the daily landing limit prior to leaving port on a subsequent trip. A vessel may retain on board up to one day's worth of such species prior to the start of a subsequent trip. Other species regulated by an overall trip limit may be retained on board for a subsequent trip. For example, a vessel that possesses cod and winter flounder harvested from Georges Bank is subject to a daily possession limit for cod of 1,000 lb (453 kg)/DAS and an overall trip limit of 5,000 lb (2,267 kg)/trip for winter flounder. In this example, the vessel would be required to offload any cod harvested in excess of 1,000 lb (453 kg) (i.e., the vessel may retain up to 1,000 lb (453 kg) of Georges Bank cod, but must offload any additional cod), but may retain on board winter flounder up to the maximum trip limit prior to leaving port and crossing the VMS Demarcation Line to begin a subsequent trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> GB winter flounder.

A vessel issued an All Areas Limited Access Herring Permit and/or an Areas 2 and 3 Limited Access Herring Permit on a declared herring trip, regardless of area fished or gear used, or a vessel issued a Limited Access Incidental Catch Herring Permit and/or an Open Access Herring Permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear pursuant to Sec. 648.80(d), may possess and land haddock, and up to 100 lb (45 kg), combined, of other regulated NE. multispecies, other than haddock, in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 648.80(d) and (e). Such fish may not be sold for human consumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Ocean pout, windowpane flounder, and Atlantic wolffish. A vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit, an open access NE multispecies Handgear B permit, or a limited access monkfish permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions may not fish for, possess, or land ocean pout, windowpane flounder, or Atlantic wolffish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Additional possession restrictions--(1) Daily landing restriction. A vessel issued a limited access NE multispecies permit, an open access NE multispecies Handgear B permit, or a limited access monkfish permit and fishing under the monkfish Category C or D permit provisions may only land regulated species or ocean pout once in any 24-hr period, based upon the time the vessel lands following the end of the previous trip. For example, if a vessel lands 1,600 lb (725.7 kg) of GOM cod at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, that vessel cannot land any more regulated species or ocean pout until at least 6 p.m. on the following Wednesday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Possession limits for vessels fishing in multiple areas. If a vessel fishes in more than one stock area on the same trip, as defined in Sec. 648.85(b)(6)(v) or Sec. 648.87(b)(1)(ii), the most restrictive trip limit for a species applies for the entire trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Pollock.

If the Regional Administrator projects that the catch of any NE multispecies stock allocated to common pool vessels pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4) will exceed the pertinent sub-ACL, NMFS may implement or adjust, at any time prior to or during the fishing year, in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, a per-DAS possession limit and/or a maximum trip limit in order to prevent exceeding the common pool sub-ACL in that fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Possession restrictions to facilitate harvest of sub-ACLs allocated to the common pool. If the Regional Administrator projects that the sub-ACL of any stock allocated to the common pool pursuant to Sec. 648.90(a)(4) will not be caught during the fishing year, the Regional Administrator may remove or adjust, in a manner consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, a per-DAS possession limit and/or a maximum trip limit in order to facilitate harvest and enable the total catch to approach, but not exceed, the pertinent sub-ACL allocated to the common pool for that fishing year.
