The act of entering into a contractual agreement with a  supplier of natural gas established for curtailment purposes does not  constitute a reason that is under the control of a facility for the  purposes of this definition. An increase in the cost or unit price of  natural gas due to normal market fluctuations not during periods of  supplier delivery restriction does not constitute a period of natural  gas curtailment or supply interruption. On-site gaseous fuel system  emergencies or equipment failures qualify as periods of supply  interruption when the emergency or failure is beyond the control of the  facility.</p><p class="depth0">Pile burner means a boiler design incorporating a design where the  anticipated biomass fuel has a high relative moisture content. Grates  serve to support the fuel, and underfire air flowing up through the  grates provides oxygen for combustion, cools the grates, promotes  turbulence in the fuel bed, and fires the fuel.
