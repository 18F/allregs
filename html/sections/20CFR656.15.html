                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing application. An employer must apply for a labor certification for a Schedule A occupation by filing an application with the appropriate DHS office, and not with an ETA application processing center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General documentation requirements. A Schedule A application must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An Application for Permanent Employment Certification form, which includes a prevailing wage determination in accordance with Sec. Sec.  656.40 and 656.41.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that notice of filing the Application for Permanent Employment Certification was provided to the bargaining representative or the employer's employees as prescribed in Sec.  656.10(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Group I documentation.

Application for certification of employment as a professional nurse may be made only under this Sec.  656.15(c) and not under Sec.  656.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Group II documentation. An employer seeking a Schedule A labor certification under Group II of Schedule A must file with DHS, as part of its labor certification application, documentary evidence of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employer seeking labor certification on behalf of an alien to be employed as an alien of exceptional ability in the sciences or arts (excluding those in the performing arts) must file documentary evidence showing the widespread acclaim and international recognition accorded the alien by recognized experts in the alien's field; and documentation showing the alien's work in that field during the past year did, and the alien's intended work in the United States will, require exceptional ability. In addition, the employer must file documentation about the alien from at least two of the following seven groups:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation of the alien's receipt of internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field for which certification is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documentation of the alien's membership in international associations, in the field for which certification is sought, which require outstanding achievement of their members, as judged by recognized international experts in their disciplines or fields;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Published material in professional publications about the alien, about the alien's work in the field for which certification is sought, which shall include the title, date, and author of such published material;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Evidence of the alien's participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization to that for which certification is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Evidence of the alien's original scientific or scholarly research contributions of major significance in the field for which certification is sought;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Evidence of the alien's authorship of published scientific or scholarly

articles in the field for which certification is sought, in international professional journals or professional journals with an international circulation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Evidence of the display of the alien's work, in the field for which certification is sought, at artistic exhibitions in more than one country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employer seeking labor certification on behalf of an alien of exceptional ability in the performing arts must file documentary evidence that the alien's work experience during the past twelve months did require, and the alien's intended work in the United States will require, exceptional ability; and must submit documentation to show this exceptional ability, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation attesting to the current widespread acclaim and international recognition accorded to the alien, and receipt of internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Published material by or about the alien, such as critical reviews or articles in major newspapers, periodicals, and/or trade journals (the title, date, and author of such material shall be indicated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documentary evidence of earnings commensurate with the claimed level of ability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Playbills and star billings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Documents attesting to the outstanding reputation of theaters, concert halls, night clubs, and other establishments in which the alien has appeared or is scheduled to appear; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Documents attesting to the outstanding reputation of theaters or repertory companies, ballet troupes, orchestras, or other organizations in which or with which the alien has performed during the past year in a leading or starring capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination. An Immigration Officer determines whether the employer and alien have met the applicable requirements of Sec.  656.10 and of Schedule A (Sec.  656.5); reviews the application; and determines whether or not the alien is qualified for and intends to pursue the Schedule A occupation. The Schedule A determination of DHS is conclusive and final. The employer, therefore, may not appeal from any such determination under the review procedures at Sec.  656.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Refiling after denial. If an application for a Schedule A occupation is denied, the employer, except where the occupation is as a physical therapist or a professional nurse, may at any time file for a labor certification on the alien beneficiary's behalf under Sec.  656.17. Labor certifications for professional nurses and for physical therapists shall not be considered under Sec.  656.17.
