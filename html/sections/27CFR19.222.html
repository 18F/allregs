                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Distilled spirits tax. 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 impose a tax on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into or brought into, the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at a like rate on all fractional parts of a proof gallon. For the current rate of tax see 26 U.S.C. 5001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Products containing distilled spirits. All products of distillation, by whatever name known, which contain distilled spirits, on which the tax imposed by law has not been paid, and any alcoholic ingredient added to such products, are considered and taxed as distilled spirits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wines with high alcohol content. Wines containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume are taxed as distilled spirits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attachment of the tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5001(b), the tax attaches to distilled spirits as soon as the substance comes into existence as such, whether it be subsequently separated as pure or impure spirits, or be immediately, or at any subsequent time, transferred into any other substance, either in the process of original production, or by any subsequent process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alcohol tax is a lien on spirits. Under 26 U.S.C. 5004, the tax becomes a first lien on the distilled spirits from the time the spirits come into existence as such. The conditions under which the first lien terminates are described in 26 U.S.C. 5004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tax credit for eligible wines and eligible flavors. Under 26 U.S.C. 5010, a credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 or 7652 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine, or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2.5 percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis is allowed at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective tax rates. Where credit against the tax is desired, the proprietor liable for the tax must establish an effective tax rate in accordance with Sec. 19.246. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each withdrawal or other taxable disposition of the distilled spirits.
