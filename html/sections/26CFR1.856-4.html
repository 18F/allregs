                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Subject to the exceptions of section 856(d) and paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``rents from real property'' means, generally, the gross amounts received for the use of, or the right to use, real property of the real estate investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts specifically included or excluded--(1) Charges for customary services. For taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, the term ``rents from real property'', for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 856(c), includes charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property, whether or not the charges are separately stated. Services furnished to the tenants of a particular building will be considered as customary if, in the geographic market in which the building is located, tenants in buildings which are of a similar class (such as luxury apartment buildings) are customarily provided with the service. The furnishing of water, heat, light, and air-conditioning, the cleaning of windows, public entrances, exits, and lobbies, the performance of general maintenance and of janitorial and cleaning services, the collection of trash, and the furnishing of elevator services, telephone answering services, incidental storage space, laundry equipment, watchman or guard services, parking facilities, and swimming pool facilities are examples of services which are customarily furnished to the tenants of a particular class of buildings in many geographic marketing areas. Where it is customary, in a particular geographic marketing area, to furnish electricity or other utilities to tenants in buildings of a particular class, the submetering of such utilities to tenants in such buildings will be considered a customary service. To qualify as a service customarily furnished, the service must be furnished or rendered to the tenants of the real estate investment trust or, primarily for the convenience or benefit of the tenant, to the guests, customers, or subtenants of the tenant. The service must be furnished through an independent contractor from whom the trust does not derive or receive any income. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976, the rules in paragraph (b)(3) of 26 CFR 1.856-4 (revised as of April 1, 1977), relating to the furnishing of services, shall continue to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Charges for customary services.

In the case of taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, rent attributable to personal property that is leased under, or in connection with, the lease of real property is treated under section 856(d)(1)(C) as ``rents from real property'' (and thus qualified for purposes of the income source requirements) if the rent attributable to the personal property is not more than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year. If, however, the rent attributable to personal property is greater than 15

percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year, then the portion of the rent from the lease that is attributable to personal property will not qualify as ``rents from real property''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, rent attributable to personal property that is leased under, or in connection with, the lease of real property is treated under section 856(d)(1)(C) as ``rents from real property'' (and thus qualified for purposes of the income source requirements) if the rent attributable to the personal property is not more than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year. If, however, the rent attributable to personal property is greater than 15

percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year, then the portion of the rent from the lease that is attributable to personal property will not qualify as ``rents from real property''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application. In general, the 15-percent test in section 856(d)(1)(C) is applied separately to each lease of real property. However, where the real estate investment trust rents all (or a portion of all) the units in a multiple unit project under substantially similar leases (such as the leasing of apartments in an apartment building or complex to individual tenants), the 15-percent test may be applied with respect to the aggregate rent received or accrued for the taxable year under the similar leases of the property, by using the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all of the personal property subject to such leases, and the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property subject to such leases. A lease of a furnished apartment is not considered to be substantially similar to a lease of an unfurnished apartment (including an apartment where the trust provides only personal property, such as major appliances, that is commonly provided by a landlord in connection with the rental of unfurnished living quarters).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976. In the case of taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976, any amount of rent that is attributable to personal property does not qualify as rent from real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disqualification of rent which depends on income or profits of any person. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, no amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real property (or personal property leased under, or in connection with, real property) qualifies as ``rents from real property'' where the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from the property. However, any amount so accured or received shall not be excluded from the term ``rents from real property'' solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales (whether or not receipts or sales are adjusted for returned merchandise, or Federal, State, or local sales taxes). Thus, for example, ``rents from real property'' would include rents where the lease provides for differing percentages or receipts or sales from different departments or from separate floors of a retail store so long as each percentage is fixed at the time of entering into the lease and a change in such percentage is not renegotiated during the term of the lease (including any renewal periods of the lease, in a manner which has the effect of basing the rent on income of profits. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section for rules relating to certain amounts received or accrued by a trust which are considered to be based on the income or profits of a sublessee of the prime tenant. The amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year which is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of the lessee's receipts or sales reduced by escalation receipts (including those determined under a formula clause) will qualify as ``rents from real property''. Escalation receipts include amounts received by a prime tenant from subtenants by reason of an agreement that rent shall be increased to reflect all or a portion of an increase in real estate taxes, property insurance, operating costs of the prime tenant, or similar items customarily included in lease escalation clauses. Where in accordance with the terms of an agreement an amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year includes both a fixed rental and a percentage of all or a portion of the lessee's income or profits, neither the fixed rental nor the additional amount will qualify as ``rents from real property''. However, where the amount received or accrued for the taxable year under such an agreement includes only the fixed rental, the determination of which does not depend in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by the lessee, such amount may qualify as ``rents from real property''. An amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year which consists, in whole or in part, of one or more percentages of the lessee's receipts or sales in excess of determinable dollar amounts may qualify as ``rents from real property'', but only if two conditions exist. First, the determinable

amounts must not depend in whole or in part on the income or profits of the lessee. Second, the percentages and, in the case of leases entered into after July 7, 1978, the determinable amounts, must be fixed at the time the lease is entered into and a change in percentages and determinable amounts is not renegotiated during the term of the lease (including any renewal periods of the lease) in a manner which has the effect of basing rent on income or profits. In any event, an amount will not qualify as ``rents from real property'' if, considering the lease and all the surrounding circumstances, the arrangement does not conform with normal business practice but is in reality used as a means of basing the rent on income or profits. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A real estate investment trust owns land underlying an office building. On January 1, 1975, the trust leases the land for 50 years to a prime tenant for an annual rental of $100x plus 20 percent of the prime tenant's annual gross receipts from the office building in excess of a fixed base amount of $5,000x and 10 percent of such gross receipts in excess of $10,000x. For this purpose the lease defines gross receipts as all amounts received by the prime tenant from occupancy tenants pursuant to leases of space in the office building reduced by the amount by which real estate taxes, property insurance, and operating costs related to the office building for a particular year exceed the amount of such items for 1974. The exclusion from gross receipts of increases since 1974 in real estate taxes, property insurance, and other expenses relating to the office building reflects the fact that the prime tenant passes on to occupancy tenants by way of a customary lease escalation provision the risk that such expenses might increase during the term of an occupancy lease. The exclusion from gross receipts of these expense escalation items will not cause the rental received by the real estate investment trust from the prime tenant to fail to qualify as ``rents from real property'' for purposes of section 856(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disqualification of amounts received from persons owned in whole or in part by the trust. ``Rents from real property'' does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, from any person in which the real estate investment trust owns, at any time during the taxable year, the specified percentage or number of shares of stock (or interest in the assets or net profits) of that person. Any amount received from such person will not qualify as ``rents from real property'' if such person is a corporation and the trust owns 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of its stock entitled to vote or 10 percent or more of the total number of shares of all classes of its outstanding stock, or if such person is not a corporation and the trust owns a 10-percent-or-more interest in its assets or net profits. For example, a trust leases an office building to a tenant for which it receives rent of $100,000 for the taxable year 1962. The lessee of the building subleases space to various subtenants for which it receives gross rent of $500,000 for the year 1962. The trust owns 15 percent of the total assets of an unincorporated subtenant. The rent paid by this subtenant for the taxable year is $50,000. Therefore, $10,000 (50,000/500,000x$100,000) of the rent paid to the trust does not qualify as ``rents from real property''. Where the real estate investment trust receives, directly or indirectly, any amount of rent from any person in which it owns any proprietary interest, the trust shall submit, at the time it files its return for the taxable year (or before June 1, 1962, whichever is later), a schedule setting forth--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of such person and the amount received as rent from such person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If such person is a corporation, the highest percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of its stock entitled to vote, and the highest percentage of the total number of shares of all classes of its outstanding stock, owned by the trust at any time during the trust's taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If such person is not a corporation, the highest percentage of the trust's interest in the assets or net profits of such person, owned by the trust at any time during its taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Furnishing of services or management of property must be through an independent contractor--(i) In general. No amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real property (or any personal property leased under, or in connection

with, the real property) qualifies as ``rents from real property'' if the real estate investment trust furnishes or renders services to the tenants of the property or manages or operates the property, other than through an independent contractor from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income. The prohibition against the trust deriving or receiving any income from the independent contractor applies regardless of the source from which the income was derived by the independent contractor. Thus, for example, the trust may not receive any dividends from the independent contractor. The requirement that the trust not receive any income from an independent contractor requires that the relationship between the two be an arm's-length relationship. The independent contractor must be adequately compensated for any services which are performed for the trust. Compensation to an independent contractor determined by reference to an unadjusted percentage of gross rents will generally be considered to be adequate where the percentage is reasonable taking into account the going rate of compensation for managing similar property in the same locality, the services rendered, and other relevant factors. The independent contractor must not be an employee of the trust (i.e., the manner in which he carries out his duties as independent contractor must not be subject to the control of the trust). Although the cost of services which are customarily rendered or furnished in connection with the rental of real property may be borne by the trust, the services must be furnished or rendered through an independent contractor. Furthermore, the facilities through which the services are furnished must be maintained and operated by an independent contractor. For example, if a heating plant is located in the building, it must be maintained and operated by an independent contractor. To the extent that services (other than those customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property) are rendered to the tenants of the property by the independent contractor, the cost of the services must be borne by the independent contractor, a separate charge must be made for the services, the amount of the separate charge must be received and retained by the independent contractor, and the independent contractor must be adequately compensated for the services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. No amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real property (or any personal property leased under, or in connection

with, the real property) qualifies as ``rents from real property'' if the real estate investment trust furnishes or renders services to the tenants of the property or manages or operates the property, other than through an independent contractor from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income. The prohibition against the trust deriving or receiving any income from the independent contractor applies regardless of the source from which the income was derived by the independent contractor. Thus, for example, the trust may not receive any dividends from the independent contractor. The requirement that the trust not receive any income from an independent contractor requires that the relationship between the two be an arm's-length relationship. The independent contractor must be adequately compensated for any services which are performed for the trust.

The trustees or directors of the real estate investment trust are not required to delegate or contract out their fiduciary duty to manage the trust itself, as distinguished from rendering or furnishing services to the tenants of its property or managing or operating the property. Thus, the trustees or directors may do all those things necessary, in their fiduciary capacities, to manage and conduct the affairs of the trust itself. For example, the trustees or directors may establish rental terms, choose tenants, enter into and renew leases, and deal with taxes, interest, and insurance, relating to the trust's property. The trustees or directors may also make capital expenditures with respect to the trust's property (as defined in section 263) and may make decisions as to repairs of the trust's property (of the type which would be deductible under section 162), the cost of which may be borne by the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Independent contractor defined. The term ``independent contractor'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A person who does not own, directly or indirectly, at any time during the trust's taxable year more than 35 percent of the shares in the real estate investment trust, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the total combined voting power of whose stock (or 35 percent of the total shares of all classes of whose stock), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If not a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the interest in whose assets or net profits is owned, directly or indirectly, at any time during the trust's taxable year by one or more persons owning at any time during such taxable year 35 percent or more of the shares in the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Information required. The real estate investment trust shall submit with its return for the taxable year (or before June 1, 1962, whichever is later) a statement setting forth the name and address of each independent contractor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The highest percentage of the outstanding shares in the trust owned at any time during its taxable year by such independent contractor and by any person owning at any time during such taxable year any shares of stock or interest in the independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the independent contractor is a corporation such statement shall set forth the highest percentage of the total combined voting power of its stock and the highest percentage of the total number of shares of all classes of its stock owned at any time during its taxable year by any person owning shares in the trust at any time during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the independent contractor is not a corporation such statement shall set forth the highest percentage of any interest in its assets or net profits owned at any time during its taxable year by any person owning shares in the trust at any time during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Amounts based on income or profits of subtenants. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, if a trust leases real property to a tenant under terms other than solely on a fixed sum rental (for example, a percentage of the tenant's gross receipts), and the tenant subleases all or a part of such property under an agreement which provides for a rental based in whole or in part on the income or profits of the sublessee, the entire amount of the rent received by the trust from the prime tenant with respect to such property is disqualified as ``rents from real property''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, if a trust leases real property to a tenant under terms other than solely on a fixed sum rental (for example, a percentage of the tenant's gross receipts), and the tenant subleases all or a part of such property under an agreement which provides for a rental based in whole or in part on the income or profits of the sublessee, the entire amount of the rent received by the trust from the prime tenant with respect to such property is disqualified as ``rents from real property''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. For taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, section 856(d)(4) provides an exception to the general rule that amounts received or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a real estate investment trust do not qualify as rents from real property if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from the property. This exception applies where the trust rents property to a tenant (the prime tenant) for a rental which is based, in whole or in part, on a fixed percentage or percentages of the receipts or sales of the prime tenant, and the rent which the trust receives or accrues from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease would not qualify as ``rents from real property'' solely because the prime tenant receives or accrues from subtenants (including concessionaires) rents or other amounts based on the income or profits derived by a person from the property. Under the exception, only a proportionate part of the rent received or accrued by the trust does not qualify as ``rents from real property''. The proportionate part of the rent received or accrued by the trust which is non-qualified is the lesser of the following two amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rent received or accrued by the trust from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease, that is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The product determined by multiplying the total rent which the trust receives or accrues from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease by a fraction, the numerator of which is the rent or other amount received by the prime tenant that is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by any person from the property, and the denominator of which is the total rent or other amount received by the prime tenant from the property. For example, assume that a real estate investment trust owns land underlying a shopping center. The trust rents the land to the owner of the shopping center for an annual rent of $10x plus 2 percent of the gross receipts which the prime tenant receives from subtenants who lease space in the shopping center. Assume further that, for the year in question, the prime tenant derives total rent from the shopping center of $100x and, of that amount, $25x is received from subtenants whose rent is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived from the property. Accordingly, the trust will receive a total rent of $12x, of which $2x is based on a percentage of the gross receipts of the prime tenant. The portion of the rent which is disqualified is the lesser of $2x (the rent received by the trust which is based on a percentage of gross receipts), or $3x, ($12x multiplied by $25x/$100x). Accordingly, $10x

of the rent received by the trust qualifies as ``rents from real property'' and $2x does not qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Attribution rules. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 856(d) relate to direct or indirect ownership of stock, assets, or net profits by the persons described therein. For purposes of determining such direct or indirect ownership, the rules prescribed by section 318(a) (for determining the ownership of stock) shall apply except that ``10 percent'' shall be substituted for ``50 percent'' in section 318(a) (2)(C) and (3)(C).
