the extent that the total amount a firm pays for the loan with the government-provided guarantee is less than the total amount the firm would pay for a comparable commercial loan that the firm could actually obtain on the market absent the government-provided guarantee, including any difference in guarantee fees.

In allocating the benefit from a government-provided loan guarantee to a particular time period, the Secretary will use the methods set forth in Sec. 351.505(c) regarding loans.</p>
