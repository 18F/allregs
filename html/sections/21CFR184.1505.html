                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mono- and diglycerides consist of a mixture of glyceryl mono- and diesters, and minor amounts of triesters, that are prepared from fats or oils or fat-forming acids that are derived from edible sources. The most prevalent fatty acids include lauric, linoleic, myristic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic. Mono- and diglycerides are manufactured by the reaction of glycerin with fatty acids or the reaction of glycerin with triglycerides in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. The products are further purified to obtain a mixture of glycerides, free fatty acids, and free glycerin that contains at least 90 percent-by-weight glycerides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed. (1981), p. 201, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

agent as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(30) of this chapter; and a texturizer as defined in Sec. 170.3(o)(32) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived.
