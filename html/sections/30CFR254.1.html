                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the coast line, you must submit a spill-response plan to BSEE for approval. Your spill-response plan must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to Sec.  254.6 for the definitions of ``oil,'' ``facility,'' and ``coast line'' if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must maintain a current response plan for an abandoned facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until the Regional Supervisor notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan for a pipeline that carries:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Oil;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gas and naturally occurring condensate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Regional Supervisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it should be regulated by BSEE, you may contact the Regional Supervisor, offer to accept BSEE jurisdiction over your facility, and request that BSEE seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a relinquishment of that jurisdiction.</p>
