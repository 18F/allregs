                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appeal Authority means the Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorizing or Denying Official means that DOE officer as identified by the Directorate of Administration by separate directive, having custody of or responsibility for records requested under 5 U.S.C. 552. In DOE Headquarters, the term refers to The Freedom of Information Officer as defined below and officials who report directly to either the Office of the Secretary or a Secretarial Officer as also defined below. In the Field Offices, the term refers to the head of a field location identified in Sec. 1004.2(h) and the heads of field offices to which they provide administrative support and have delegated this authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> `Commercial use' request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, agencies must determine how the requester will use the documents requested. Moreover, where DOE has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not evident from the request itself, the DOE will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Department or Department of Energy (DOE) means all organizational entities which are a part of the executive department created by Title II of the DOE Organization Act, Pub L. 95-91. This specifically excludes the FERC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Direct costs means those expenditures which the DOE actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of, but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk). The copy provided must be in a form that can be reasonably used by requesters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Officer means the person designated to administer the Freedom of Information Act at the following DOE offices:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bonneville Power Administration, P.O. Box 3621, Portland, OR 97232.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carlsbad Field Office, P.O. Box 3090, Carlsbad, NM 88221.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chicago Office, 9800 S. Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center, 250 East 5th Street, Suite 500, Cincinnati, OH 45202.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Boulevard, Golden, CO 80401.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Headquarters, Department of Energy, Washington, DC 20585.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Idaho Operations Office, 1955 Fremont Avenue, MS 1203, Idaho Falls, ID 83401.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> National Nuclear Security Administration Albuquerque Complex, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185-5400.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> National Energy Technology Laboratory, 3610 Collins Ferry Road, Morgantown, WV 26507-0800.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Naval Reactors Laboratory Field Office, P.O. Box 109, West Mifflin, PA 15122-0109.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Oak Ridge Office, P.O. Box 2001, Oak Ridge, TN 37831.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Office of Naval Reactors, Headquarters, 1240 Isaac Hull Avenue SE., Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-0822.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Office of Scientific and Technical Information, P.O. Box 2001, Oak Ridge, TN 37831.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Richland Operations Office, P.O. Box 550, Mail Stop A7-75, Richland, WA 99352.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Savannah River Operations Office, P.O. Box A, Aiken, SC 29801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Southeastern Power Administration, 1166 Athens Tech Road, Elberton, GA 30635-6711.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Southwestern Power Administration, One West Third, S1200, Tulsa, OK 74103.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Strategic Petroleum Reserve Project Management Office, 900 Commerce Road East-MS FE-455, New Orleans, LA 70123.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Western Area Power Administration, 12155 W. Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 281213, Lakewood, CO 80228-8213.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General Counsel means the General Counsel provided for in section 202(b) of the DOE Organization Act, or any DOE attorney designated by the General Counsel as having responsibility for counseling the Department on Freedom of Information Act matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Headquarters means all DOE facilities functioning within the Washington metropolitan area except the Office of Naval Reactors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referenced in Sec. 1004.2(c), and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Office means any administrative or operating unit of the DOE, including those in field offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Representative of the news media refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.</p><p class="depth2">Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but agencies may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Review refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request (see Sec. 1004.2(c)) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise pepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Search includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. The DOE will search for material in the most efficient and least expensive manner in order to minimize cost for both DOE and the requester. For example, DOE will not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. ``Search'' will be distinguished, moreover, from ``review'' of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Secretarial Officer means the Under Secretary; Under Secretary for Science; Administrator, Energy Information Administration; Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration; Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs;

Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management; Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy; Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs; Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Health, Safety and Security Officer; Chief Human Capital Officer; Chief Information Officer; ``Director, Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy'', ``Director, Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs'', and ``Director, Loan Programs Office, Director, Office of Economic Impact and Diversity; Director, Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals; Director, Office of Legacy Management; Director, Office of Management; Director, Office of Public Affairs; Director, Office of Science; General Counsel; Inspector General; and Senior Intelligence Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records, at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi), means any statute that specifically requires a government agency, such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), to set the level of fees for particular types of records, in order to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by conveniently making available government information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications and other services which are for their special use so that these costs are not borne by the general taxpaying public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating government information.
