                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. Except as provided elsewhere in this section, the  Records Management Officer shall assess fees where applicable in  accordance with this section for search, review, and duplication of  records requested. The Records Management Officer shall also have  authority to furnish documents without any charge or at a reduced charge  if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is  likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the  operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fee schedule; waiver of fees. The fees applicable to a  request for Council records pursuant to Sec.  1850.5 are set forth in  the following uniform fee schedule:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manual search......................  Actual salary rate of employee</p><p class="depth4">involved, plus 16 percent of</p><p class="depth4">salary rate to cover benefits. (ii) Computerized search...............  Actual direct cost, including</p><p class="depth4">operator time. (iii) Duplication of records:</p><p class="depth5"><em>(A)</em> Paper copy reproduction........  $0.05 per page.</p><p class="depth5"><em>(B)</em> Other reproduction (e.g.,        Actual direct cost, including</p><p class="depth6">computer disk or printout,           operator time.</p><p class="depth6">microfilm, microfiche, or</p><p class="depth6">microform). (iv) Review of records (including        Actual salary rate of employee</p><p class="depth6">redaction).                              involved, plus 16 percent of</p><p class="depth6">salary rate to cover benefits. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Council shall charge search fees for all  requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(5) of this  section. The Records Management Officer shall charge for time spent  searching for responsive records, even if no responsive record is  located or if the Records Management Officer withholds records located  as entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall equal the direct  costs of conducting the search by the Council employee involved, plus 16  percent of the salary rate to cover benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For computer searches of records, the Council will charge  requesters the direct costs of conducting the search. In accordance with  paragraph (f) of this section, however, the Council will charge certain  requesters no search fee and certain other requesters are entitled to  the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge.  These direct costs include the costs attributable to the salary of an  operator/programmer performing a computer search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication. The Council will charge duplication fees to all  requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(5) of this  section. The fee for a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one  copy of which need be supplied) is 5 cents per page. The Records  Management Officer will charge the requester for the direct costs,  including operator time, of making copies produced by computer, such as  tapes or printouts. The Records Management Officer will charge a  requester the direct costs of providing other forms of duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review. The Council will charge review fees to requesters who  make a commercial use request. Review fees generally are limited to the  initial record review, i.e., the review done when the Records Management  Officer determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record  at the initial request level. The Council will not charge a requester  for additional review at the administrative appeal level. Review fees  consist of the direct costs of conducting the review by the Council  employee involved, plus 16 percent of the salary rate to cover benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Limitations on charging fees. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Council will not charge a  search fee for requests from educational institutions, noncommercial  scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Council will not charge a search fee or review fee for a  quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for  search or review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Council will not charge a fee to a requester whenever the  total fee calculated under this paragraph is $25 or less for the  request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the  Council will provide without charge the first 100 pages of duplication  (or the cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this  section work together. This means that for requesters other than those  seeking records for a commercial use, no fee shall be charged unless the  cost of search is in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in  excess of 100 pages totals more than $25.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> No search fees shall be charged to a requester when the Council  does not comply with the statutory time limits at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in  which to respond to a request, unless unusual or exceptional  circumstances (as those terms are defined by the FOIA) apply to the  processing of the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> No duplication fees shall be charged to requesters in the fee  category of a representative of the news media or an educational or  noncommercial scientific institution when the Council does not comply  with the statutory time limits at 5 U.S.C.   552(a)(6) in which to respond to a request, unless unusual or  exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined by the FOIA) apply  to the processing of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment procedures. All requesters shall pay the applicable fee  before the Council sends copies of the requested records, unless the  Records Management Official grants a fee waiver. Requesters must pay  fees by check or money order made payable to the ``Treasury of the  United States.'' Checks and money orders should be mailed to 500 Poydras  Street, Suite 1117, New Orleans, LA 70130.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advance notification of fees. If the estimated charges exceed  $25, the Records Management Officer shall notify the requester of the  estimated amount, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to  pay fees as high as those anticipated. Upon receipt of such notice, the  requester may confer with the Records Management Officer to reformulate  the request to lower the costs. Council staff shall suspend processing  the request until the requester provides the Records Management Officer  with a written guarantee that the requester will make payment upon  completion of processing (i.e., upon completion of the search, review  and duplication, but prior the Council sending copies of the requested  records to the requester).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Advance payment. The Records Management Officer shall require  advance payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Records  Management Officer also shall require full payment in advance where a  requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion. If an  advance payment of an estimated fee exceeds the actual total fee by $1  or more, the Council shall refund the difference to the requester. The  Council shall suspend the processing of the request and the statutory  time period for responding to the request until the Records Management  Officer receives the required payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Categories of uses. The fees assessed depend upon the fee  category. In determining which category is appropriate, the Records  Management Officer shall look to the identity of the requester and the  intended use set forth in the request for records. Where a requester's  description of the use is insufficient to make a determination, the  Records Management Officer may seek additional clarification before  categorizing the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use requester: The fees for search, duplication, and  review apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational institutions, non-commercial scientific  institutions, or representatives of the news media requesters: The fees  for duplication apply. The Council will provide the first 100 pages of  duplication free of charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All other requesters: The fees for search and duplication apply.  The Council will provide the first two hours of search time and the  first 100 pages of duplication free of charge.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial Use Requesters..........  Search, Review, and</p><p class="depth4">Duplication. (ii) Education and Non-commercial        Duplication (excluding the cost</p><p class="depth4">Scientific Institution Requesters.       of the first 100 pages). (iii) Representatives of the News Media  Duplication (excluding the cost</p><p class="depth4">of the first 100 pages). (iv) All Other Requesters..............  Search and Duplication</p><p class="depth4">(excluding the cost of the</p><p class="depth4">first 2 hours of search and</p><p class="depth4">first 100 pages of</p><p class="depth4">duplication). ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nonproductive search. The Council may charge fees for search  even if no responsive documents are found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Interest charges. The Records Management Officer may assess  interest charges on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day  following the date the Council sent the bill to the requester. The  Council will charge interest at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 on  fees payable in accordance with this section. The Council will follow  the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96  Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including  the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Aggregated requests. A requester may not file multiple requests  at the   same time solely in order to avoid payment of fees. If the Council  reasonably believes that a request, or a group of requesters acting in  concert, is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests  for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Council may  aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. The Records  Management Officer may reasonably presume that one requester making  multiple requests on the same topic within a 30-day period has done so  to avoid fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. To seek a waiver, a requester shall  include the request for waiver or reduction of fees, and the  justification for such based on the factors set forth in this paragraph,  with the request for records to which it pertains. If a requester  requests a waiver or reduction and has not indicated in writing an  agreement to pay the applicable fees, the time for responding to the  request for Council records shall not begin until the Records Management  Officer makes a determination regarding the request for a waiver or  reduction of fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without  charge, or at a reduced rate below that established in paragraph (b) of  this section, where the Council determines, after consideration of all  available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure of the requested information is in the public  interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public  understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is  in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly  to public understanding of the operations or activities of the  Government, the Council will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns the operations or activities of the Government. The  subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or  activities of the Federal government, with a connection that is direct  and clear, not remote or attenuated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed:  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  of Government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the  requested records must be meaningfully informative about government  operations or activities in order to be ``likely to contribute'' to an  increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The  disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in  either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be likely  to contribute to such an understanding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  public: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute  to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons  interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of  the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as  his or her ability and intention to effectively convey information to  the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a  representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration. Merely  providing information to media sources is insufficient to satisfy this  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding:  Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to  public understanding of Government operations or activities. The  public's understanding of the subject in question prior to disclosure  must be significantly enhanced by the disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is  primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Council will  consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether  the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  requested disclosure. The Council shall consider any commercial interest  of the requester (with reference to the definition of ``commercial use  request'' in Sec.  1850.2(b)), or of any person on whose behalf the  requester may be acting,   that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be  given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified  commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently great, in  comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure if  ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' A fee waiver  or reduction is justified if the public interest standard (paragraph  (j)(1)(i) of this section) is satisfied and the public interest is  greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The  Council shall presume that if a news media requester has satisfied the  public interest standard, the public interest is the primary interest  served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or  others who merely compile and market Government information for direct  economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public  interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A request for a waiver or reduction of fees shall include a  clear statement of how the request satisfies the criteria set forth in  paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each  request. The burden shall be on the requester to present evidence or  information in support of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the  requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Records Management Officer shall make a determination on the  request for a waiver or reduction of fees and shall notify the requester  accordingly. A denial may be appealed to the General Counsel in  accordance with Sec.  1850.7.</p>
