For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Changes requiring supplement submission and approval prior to distribution of the product made using the change (major changes). (1) A supplement shall be submitted for any change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, or responsible personnel that has a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These changes include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, changes in the qualitative or quantitative formulation, including inactive ingredients, or in the specifications provided in the approved application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes requiring completion of an appropriate human study to demonstrate the equivalence of the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes in the virus or adventitious agent removal or inactivation method(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Changes in the source material or cell line;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Establishment of a new master cell bank or seed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Changes which may affect product sterility assurance, such as changes in product or component sterilization method(s), or an addition, deletion, or substitution of steps in an aseptic processing operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant must obtain approval of the supplement from FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change. Except for submissions under paragraph (e) of this section, the following shall be contained in the supplement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of the proposed change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The product(s) involved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturing site(s) or area(s) affected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the methods used and studies performed to evaluate the effect of the change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The data derived from such studies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Relevant validation protocols and data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A reference list of relevant standard operating procedures (SOP's).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a supplement for public health reasons or if a delay in making the change described in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. Such a supplement and its mailing cover should be plainly marked: ``Prior Approval Supplement-Expedited Review Requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes requiring supplement submission at least 30 days prior to distribution of the product made using the change. (1) A supplement shall be submitted for any change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, or responsible personnel that has a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. The supplement shall be labeled ``Supplement--Changes Being Effected in 30 Days'' or, if applicable under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, ``Supplement--Changes Being Effected.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These changes include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An increase or decrease in production scale during finishing steps that involves different equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Replacement of equipment with that of similar, but not identical, design and operating principle that does not affect the process methodology or process operating parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Relaxation of an acceptance criterion or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pending approval of the supplement by FDA, and except as provided

These circumstances may include substantial similarity with a type of change regularly involving a ``Supplement--Changes Being Effected'' supplement or a situation in which the applicant presents evidence that the proposed change has been validated in accordance with an approved protocol for such change under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the agency disapproves the supplemental application, it may order the manufacturer to cease distribution of the products made with the manufacturing change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes to be described in an annual report (minor changes).

Any such protocols, or change to a protocol, shall be submitted as a supplement requiring approval from FDA prior to distribution of the product which, if approved, may justify a reduced reporting category for the particular change because the use of the protocol for that type of change reduces the potential risk of an adverse effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Labeling changes. (1) Labeling changes requiring supplement submission--FDA approval must be obtained before distribution of the product with the labeling change. Except as described in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, an applicant shall submit a supplement describing a proposed change in the package insert, package label, container label, or, if applicable, a Medication Guide required under part 208 of this chapter, and include the information necessary to support the proposed change.

supplement is submitted. The supplement shall clearly identify the change being made and include necessary supporting data. The supplement and its mailing cover shall be plainly marked: ``Special Labeling Supplement--Changes Being Effected.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labeling changes requiring submission in an annual report.
