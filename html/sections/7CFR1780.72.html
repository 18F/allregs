                            <p class="depth0">Procurement shall be made by one of the following methods: Small  purchase procedures; competitive sealed bids (formal advertising);  competitive negotiation; or noncompetitive negotiation. Competitive  sealed bids (formal advertising) is the preferred procurement method for  construction contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Small purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those  relatively simple and informal procurement methods that are sound and  appropriate for a procurement of services, supplies or other property,  costing in the aggregate not more than $100,000. If small purchase  procedures are used for a procurement, written price or rate quotations  shall be requested from at least three qualified sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Competitive sealed bids. In competitive sealed bids (formal  advertising), an invitation for sealed bids is publicly   advertised and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is  awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the  material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is lowest,  price and other factors considered. When using this method the following  shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The invitation for bids shall be publicly advertised at a  sufficient time prior to the date set for opening of bids. The  invitation shall comply with the requirements in Sec. 1780.70(d). Bids  shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated  in the invitation for bids;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A firm-fixed-price contract award shall be made by written  notice to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the  invitation for bids, is lowest. When specified in the bidding documents,  factors such as discounts and transportation costs shall be considered  in determining which bid is lowest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any or all bids may be rejected by the owner when it is in its  best interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Competitive negotiation. In competitive negotiations, proposals  are requested from a number of sources and the Request for Proposal is  publicized. Negotiations are normally conducted with more than one of  the sources submitting offers. Competitive negotiation may be used if  conditions are not appropriate for the use of formal advertising and  where discussions and bargaining with a view to reaching agreement on  the technical quality, price, other terms of the proposed contract and  specifications may be necessary. If competitive negotiation is used for  a procurement, the following requirements shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of  qualified sources to permit reasonable competition consistent with the  nature and requirements of the Procurement. The Request for Proposal  shall be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete  shall be honored to the maximum extent practicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Request for Proposal shall identify all significant  evaluation factors and their relative importance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner shall provide mechanisms for technical evaluation of  the proposals received, determination of responsible offerors for the  purpose of written or oral discussions, and selection for contract  award; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Award may be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal will  be most advantageous to the owner. Unsuccessful offerors should be  promptly notified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Noncompetitive negotiation. Noncompetitive negotiation is  procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or  after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined  inadequate. Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a  contract is not feasible under small purchase or competitive sealed  bids. Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by  noncompetitive negotiations are limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The item is available only from a single source; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There exists a public exigency or emergency and the urgency for  the requirement will not permit a delay incident to competitive  solicitation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is  determined inadequate; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The procurement is for professional services; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The aggregate amount does not exceed $100,000.
