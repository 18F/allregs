                                Sec. 27.200  Information regarding security risk for a chemical facility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information to determine security risk. In order to determine  the security risk posed by chemical facilities, the Secretary may, at  any time, request information from chemical facilities that may reflect  potential consequences of or vulnerabilities to a terrorist attack or  incident, including questions specifically related to the nature of the  business and activities conducted at the facility; information  concerning the names, nature, conditions of storage, quantities,  volumes, properties, customers, major uses, and other pertinent  information about specific chemicals or chemicals meeting a specific  criterion; information concerning facilities' security, safety, and  emergency response practices, operations, and procedures; information  regarding incidents, history, funding, and other matters bearing on the  effectiveness of the security, safety and emergency response programs,  and other information as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obtaining information from facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant  Secretary may seek the information provided in paragraph (a) of this  section by contacting chemical facilities individually or by publishing  a notice in the Federal Register seeking information from chemical  facilities that meet certain criteria, which the Department will use to  determine risk profiles. Through any such individual or Federal Register  notification, the Assistant Secretary may instruct such facilities to  complete and submit a Top-Screen process, which may be completed through  a secure Department Web site or through other means approved by the  Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A facility must complete and submit a Top-Screen in accordance  with the schedule provided in Sec. 27.210, the calculation provisions  in Sec. 27.203, and the minimum concentration provisions in Sec.  27.204 if it possesses any of the chemicals listed in appendix A to this  part at or above the STQ for any applicable Security Issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the Department requests that a facility complete and  submit a Top-Screen, the facility must designate a person who is  responsible for the submission of information through the CSAT system  and who attests to the accuracy of the information contained in any CSAT  submissions. Such submitter must be an officer of the corporation or  other person designated by an officer of the corporation and must be  domiciled in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presumptively High Risk Facilities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a chemical facility  subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section fails to provide  information requested or complete the Top-Screen within the timeframe  provided in Sec. 27.210, the Assistant Secretary may, after attempting  to consult with the facility, reach a preliminary determination, based  on the information then available, that the facility presumptively  presents a high level of security risk. The Assistant Secretary shall  then issue a notice to the entity of this determination and, if  necessary, order the facility to provide information or complete the  Top-Screen pursuant to these rules. If the facility then fails to do so,  it may be subject to civil penalties pursuant to Sec. 27.300, audit and  inspection under Sec. 27.250 or, if appropriate, an order to cease  operations under Sec. 27.300.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the facility deemed ``presumptively high risk'' pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1) of this section completes the Top-Screen, and the  Department determines that it does not present a high level of security  risk under Sec. 27.205, its status as ``presumptively high risk'' will  terminate, and the Department will issue a notice to the facility to  that effect.
