up to such purpose without unreasonable waste. Stumps will be cut so as to cause the least possible waste and all trees will be utilized to as low a diameter in the tops as possible. All brush, tops, logs, and other forest debris made in felling and removing timber under this section shall be disposed of as best adapted to the protection of the remaining growth and in such manner as shall be prescribed by the authorized officer, and failure on the part of the applicant, or an agent cutting for an applicant, to comply with this requirement will render him liable for all expenses incurred by the authorized officer in putting this regulation into effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Area of land to be cut over.
