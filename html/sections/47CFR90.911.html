                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. Parties seeking approval for partitioning and  disaggregation shall request an authorization for partial assignment of  a license pursuant to Sec. 90.153(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technical standards--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partitioning. In the case of  partitioning, requests for authorization for partial assignment of a  license must include, as attachments, a description of the partitioned  service area and a calculation of the population of the partitioned  service area and the licensed geographic service area. The partitioned  service area shall be defined by coordinate points at every 3 degrees  along the partitioned service area unless an FCC recognized service area  is utilized (i.e., Major Trading Area, Basic Trading Area, Metropolitan  Service Area, Rural Service Area or Economic Area) or   county lines are followed. The geographic coordinates must be specified  in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and  longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).  In the case where an FCC recognized service area or county lines are  utilized, applicants need only list the specific area(s) (through use of  FCC designations or county names) that constitute the partitioned area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The Commission will  consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose  combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License term. The license term for a partitioned license area  and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original  licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. Sec. 90.629(a),  90.665(a) or 90.685(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Construction and channel usage requirements--incumbent  licensees. Parties seeking to acquire a partitioned license or  disaggregated spectrum from an incumbent licensee will be required to  construct and commence ``service to subscribers'' all facilities  acquired through such transactions within the original construction  deadline for each facility as set forth in Sec. Sec. 90.629 and 90.683.  Failure to meet the individual construction deadline will result in the  automatic termination of the facility's authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Construction and channel usage requirements--EA licensees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Licensees in channel blocks A, B and C--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements for  partitioning. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the  applicable construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.685(c) for  the partitioned license area; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet the  three and five year construction requirements set forth in Sec.  90.685(c) for the entire market.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Applications requesting partial assignments of license for  partitioning must include a certification by each party as to which of  the above options they select.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance  with the respective construction requirements within the appropriate  time frames set forth in Sec. 90.685(c).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction  requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the  partitioned license without further Commission action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to  disaggregate spectrum from an EA licensee in Spectrum Blocks A, B and C  must meet one of the following channel use requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the channel  usage requirements set forth in Sec. 90.685(d) for the disaggregated  spectrum; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet the  channel usage requirements as set forth in Sec. 90.685(d) for the  entire spectrum block. In that case, the disaggregatee must only satisfy  the requirements for ``substantial service,'' as set forth in Sec.  90.685(c), for the disaggregated spectrum within five years of the  license grant.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Applications requesting partial assignments of license for  disaggregation must include a certification by each party as to which of  the above options they select.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Disaggregatees must submit supporting documents showing  compliance with the respective channel usage requirements within the  appropriate time frames set forth in Sec. 90.685(c).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Failure by any disaggregatee to meet its respective channel  usage requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the  disaggregated license without further Commission action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees in channel blocks D through V--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements for  partitioning. Parties seeking authority to partition an EA license must  meet one of the following construction requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable  construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.685(c) for the  partitioned license area; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet the  construction requirements set forth in Sec. 90.685(c) for the entire  market.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Applications requesting partial assignments of license for  partitioning must include a certification by each party as to which of  the above options they select.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance  with the respective construction requirements within the appropriate  time frames set forth in Sec. 90.685(c).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction  requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the  partitioned license without further Commission action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements for disaggregation. Parties seeking authority to  disaggregate must submit with their partial assignment application a  certification signed by both parties stating which of the parties will  be responsible for meeting the construction requirements for the market  as set forth in Sec. 90.685. Parties may agree to share responsibility  for meeting the construction requirements. Parties that accept  responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fail  to do so will be subject to license forfeiture without further  Commission action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification concerning relocation of incumbent licensees.  Parties seeking approval of a partitioning or disaggregation agreement  pursuant to this section must include a certification with their partial  assignment of license application as to which party will be responsible  for meeting the incumbent relocation requirements set forth at Sec.  90.699.
