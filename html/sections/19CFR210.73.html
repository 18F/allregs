The Commission, through the Office  of Unfair Import Investigations, will review reports submitted pursuant  to any exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order and  conduct such further investigation as it deems necessary to insure  compliance with its orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extension of time. The Director of the Office of Unfair Import  Investigations may, for good cause shown, extend the time in which  reports required by exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and  consent orders may be filed. An extension of time within which a report  may be filed, or the filing of a report that does not evidence full  compliance with the order, does not in any circumstances suspend or  relieve a respondent from its obligation under the law with respect to  compliance with such order.</p>
