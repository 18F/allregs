                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recall is an effective method of removing or correcting consumer  products that are in violation of laws administered by the Food and Drug  Administration. Recall is a voluntary action that takes place because  manufacturers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect  the public health and well-being from products that present a risk of  injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and  Sec. Sec. 7.41 through 7.59 recognize the voluntary nature of recall by  providing guidance so that responsible firms may effectively discharge  their recall responsibilities. These sections also recognize that recall  is an alternative to a Food and Drug Administration-initiated court  action for removing or correcting violative, distributed products by  setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and   Drug Administration to monitor recalls and assess the adequacy of a  firm's efforts in recall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recall may be undertaken voluntarily and at any time by  manufacturers and distributors, or at the request of the Food and Drug  Administration. A request by the Food and Drug Administration that a  firm recall a product is reserved for urgent situations and is to be  directed to the firm that has primary responsibility for the manufacture  and marketing of the product that is to be recalled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recall is generally more appropriate and affords better  protection for consumers than seizure, when many lots of product have  been widely distributed. Seizure, multiple seizure, or other court  action is indicated when a firm refuses to undertake a recall requested  by the Food and Drug Administration, or where the agency has reason to  believe that a recall would not be effective, determines that a recall  is ineffective, or discovers that a violation is continuing.
