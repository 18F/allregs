                            <p class="depth0">There shall be established a Federal Reserve System Labor Relations  Panel, which shall consist of three members: one member of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, who shall be Chairperson of the  Panel, and two public members. Each member shall be selected by the  Board of Governors; provided, however, that the public members shall not  have any present or past affiliation with the Federal Reserve System.  Initially, one of the two public members shall be appointed for a term  of two years, and   the other for a term of three years. Thereafter, each public member  shall be appointed for a term of three years, except that in the case of  an unexpired term of a former member, the successor shall be appointed  to fill such unexpired term. Upon the expiration of their term of  office, public members may continue to serve until their successors are  appointed and have qualified. A public member may be removed by the  Board only upon notice and hearing, and only for neglect of duty or  malfeasance in office. The Panel shall be responsible for the duties  assigned to it as set forth in this Policy.</p>
