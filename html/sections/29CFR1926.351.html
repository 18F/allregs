                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manual electrode holders. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only manual electrode holders  which are specifically designed for arc welding and cutting, and are of  a capacity capable of safely handling the maximum rated current required  by the electrodes, shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any current-carrying parts passing through the portion of the  holder which the arc welder or cutter grips in his hand, and the outer  surfaces of the jaws of the holder, shall be fully insulated against the  maximum voltage encountered to ground.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Welding cables and connectors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All arc welding and cutting  cables shall be of the completely insulated, flexible type, capable of  handling the maximum current requirements of the work in progress,  taking into account the duty cycle under which the arc welder or cutter  is working.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only cable free from repair or splices for a minimum distance of  10 feet from the cable end to which the electrode holder is connected  shall be used, except that cables with standard insulated connectors or  with splices whose insulating quality is equal to that of the cable are  permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When it becomes necessary to connect or splice lengths of cable  one to another, substantial insulated connectors of a capacity at least  equivalent to that of the cable shall be used. If connections are  effected by means of cable lugs, they shall be securely fastened  together to give good electrical contact, and the exposed metal parts of  the lugs shall be completely insulated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cables in need of repair shall not be used. When a cable, other  than the cable lead referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,  becomes worn to the extent of exposing bare conductors, the portion thus  exposed shall be protected by means of rubber and friction tape or other  equivalent insulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ground returns and machine grounding. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A ground return cable   shall have a safe current carrying capacity equal to or exceeding the  specified maximum output capacity of the arc welding or cutting unit  which it services. When a single ground return cable services more than  one unit, its safe current-carrying capacity shall equal or exceed the  total specified maximum output capacities of all the units which it  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pipelines containing gases or flammable liquids, or conduits  containing electrical circuits, shall not be used as a ground return.  For welding on natural gas pipelines, the technical portions of  regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, Office of  Pipeline Safety, 49 CFR part 192, Minimum Federal Safety Standards for  Gas Pipelines, shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a structure or pipeline is employed as a ground return  circuit, it shall be determined that the required electrical contact  exists at all joints. The generation of an arc, sparks, or heat at any  point shall cause rejection of the structures as a ground circuit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a structure or pipeline is continuously employed as a  ground return circuit, all joints shall be bonded, and periodic  inspections shall be conducted to ensure that no condition of  electrolysis or fire hazard exists by virtue of such use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The frames of all arc welding and cutting machines shall be  grounded either through a third wire in the cable containing the circuit  conductor or through a separate wire which is grounded at the source of  the current. Grounding circuits, other than by means of the structure,  shall be checked to ensure that the circuit between the ground and the  grounded power conductor has resistance low enough to permit sufficient  current to flow to cause the fuse or circuit breaker to interrupt the  current.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All ground connections shall be inspected to ensure that they  are mechanically strong and electrically adequate for the required  current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operating instructions. Employers shall instruct employees in  the safe means of arc welding and cutting as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When electrode holders are to be left unattended, the electrodes  shall be removed and the holders shall be so placed or protected that  they cannot make electrical contact with employees or conducting  objects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hot electrode holders shall not be dipped in water; to do so may  expose the arc welder or cutter to electric shock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the arc welder or cutter has occasion to leave his work or  to stop work for any appreciable length of time, or when the arc welding  or cutting machine is to be moved, the power supply switch to the  equipment shall be opened.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any faulty or defective equipment shall be reported to the  supervisor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> See Sec. 1926.406(c) for additional requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shielding. Whenever practicable, all arc welding and cutting  operations shall be shielded by noncombustible or flameproof screens  which will protect employees and other persons working in the vicinity  from the direct rays of the arc.
