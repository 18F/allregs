Some multi-purpose lighters have a feature that allows for hands-free operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multi-purpose lighter, (also known as grill lighter, fireplace lighter, utility lighter, micro-torch, or gas match, etc.) means: A hand-held, flame-producing product that operates on fuel, incorporates an ignition mechanism, and is used by consumers to ignite items such as candles, fuel for fireplaces, charcoal or gas-fired grills, camp fires, camp stoves, lanterns, fuel-fired appliances or devices, or pilot lights, or for uses such as soldering or brazing. Some multi-purpose lighters have a feature that allows for hands-free operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following products are not multi-purpose lighters:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Devices intended primarily for igniting cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, whether or not such devices are subject to the requirements of the Safety Standard for Cigarette Lighters (16 CFR part 1210).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Devices containing more than 10 oz. of fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Matches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Successful operation means one signal of any duration from a surrogate multi-purpose lighter within either of the two 5-minute test periods specified in Sec. 1212.4(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Surrogate multi-purpose lighter means a device that</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surrogate multi-purpose lighter means a device that</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Approximates the appearance, size, shape, and weight of, and is identical in all other factors that affect child resistance (including operation and the force(s) required for operation), within reasonable manufacturing tolerances, to, a multi-purpose lighter intended for use by consumers,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has no fuel,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not produce a flame, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> produces an audible, or audible and visual, signal that will be clearly discernible when the surrogate multi-purpose lighter is activated in each manner that would produce a flame in a fueled production multi-purpose lighter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This definition does not require a multi-purpose lighter to be modified with electronics or the like to produce a signal. Manufacturers may use a multi-purpose lighter without fuel as a surrogate multi-purpose lighter if a distinct audible signal, such as a ``click,'' can be heard clearly when the mechanism is operated in each manner that would produce a flame in a production lighter and if a flame cannot be produced in a production multi-purpose lighter without the signal. But see Sec. 1212.4(f)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Child-resistant mechanism means the mechanism of a multi-purpose lighter that makes the lighter resist successful operation by young children, as specified in Sec. 1212.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Model means one or more multi-purpose lighters from the same manufacturer or importer that do not differ in design or other characteristics in any manner that may affect child resistance. Lighter characteristics that may affect child resistance include, but are not limited to, size, shape, case material, and ignition mechanism (including child-resistant features).</p>
