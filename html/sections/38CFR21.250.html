(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107, 3117)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term program (period) of employment  services includes the counseling, medical, social, and other placement  and postplacement services provided to a veteran under 38 U.S.C. Chapter  31 to assist the veteran in obtaining or maintaining suitable  employment. The term program of employment services is used only if the  veteran's eligibility under Chapter 31 is limited to employment  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term job development means a comprehensive professional  service to assist the individual veteran to actually obtain a suitable  job, and not simply the solicitation of jobs on behalf of the veteran.  Continuing and mutually beneficial relationships with employers should  be established by VA staff through referral of suitable employees and  supportive services (e.g., adjustment counseling and job modification).  Job development activities by VA staff are intended to provide disabled  workers with a chance for suitable employment with cooperating  employers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term employable means the veteran is able to secure and  maintain employment in the competitive labor market or in a sheltered  workshop or other special situation at the minimum wage.
