                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies must transfer electronic records in a  format that is independent of specific hardware or software. Except as  specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the records  must be written in American Standard Code for Information Interchange  (ASCII) or Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) with  all control characters and other non-data characters removed. Agencies  must consult with the National Archives and Records Administration,  Electronic/Special Media Records Services Division (NWME), 8601 Adelphi  Road, College Park, MD 20740, phone number (301) 837-1578 about  electronic records in other formats.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies must have advance approval from NARA for compression of  the records, and agencies must comply with a request from NARA to  provide the software to decompress the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agencies interested in transferring scheduled electronic records  using a Tape Archive (TAR) utility must contact the National Archives  and Records Administration, Electronic/Special Media Records Services  Division (NWME), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740, phone number  (301) 837-1578 to initiate transfer discussions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Data files and databases. Data files and databases must be  transferred to the National Archives of the United States as flat files  or as rectangular tables; i.e., as two-dimensional arrays, lists, or  tables. All ``records'' (within the context of the computer program, as  opposed to a Federal record) or ``tuples,'' i.e., ordered collections of  data items, within a file or table must have the same logical format.  Each data element within a record must contain only one data value. A  record must not contain nested repeating groups of data items. The file  must not contain extraneous control characters, except record length  indicators for variable length records, or marks delimiting a data  element, field, record, or file. If records or data elements in  different files need to be linked or combined, then each record must  contain one or more data elements that constitute primary and/or foreign  keys enabling valid linkages between the related records in separate  files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Digital geospatial data files. Digital spatial data files must  be transferred to the National Archives of the United States in a format  that complies with a non-proprietary, published open standard maintained  by or for a Federal, national, or international standards organization.  Acceptable transfer formats include the Geography Markup Language (GML)  as defined by the Open GIS Consortium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Textual documents. Electronic textual documents must be  transferred as plain ASCII files; however, such files may contain  standard markup language such as Standard Generalized Markup Language  (SGML) or XML tags.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Electronic mail, scanned images of textual records, portable  document format records, digital photographic records, and Web content  records. For guidance on the transfer of these records to NARA, agencies  should consult the transfer requirements available on the NARA  Electronic Records Management Initiative Web page at http:// www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/transfer-to-nara.html or  contact the National Archives and Records Administration, Special Media  Archives Services Division (NWCS), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD  20740, phone number 301-837-2903 for digital photographs and metadata,  or the National Archives and Records Administration, Electronic/Special  Media Records Services Division (NWME), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park,  MD 20740, phone number (301) 837-1578, for other electronic records,</p>
