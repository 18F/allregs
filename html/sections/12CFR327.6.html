                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Final quarterly certified invoice for acquired institution. An  institution that is not the resulting or surviving institution in a  merger or consolidation must file a report of condition for every  assessment period prior to the assessment period in which the merger or  consolidation occurs. The surviving or resulting institution shall be  responsible for ensuring that these reports of condition are filed and  shall be liable for any unpaid assessments on the part of the  institution that is not the resulting or surviving institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment for quarter in which the merger or consolidation  occurs. For an assessment period in which a merger or consolidation  occurs, consolidated   total assets for the surviving or resulting institution shall include  the consolidated total assets of all insured depository institutions  that are parties to the merger or consolidation as if the merger or  consolidation occurred on the first day of the assessment period. Tier 1  capital shall be reported in the same manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other termination. When the insured status of an institution is  terminated, and the deposit liabilities of such institution are not  assumed by another insured depository institution--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment of assessments; quarterly certified statement invoices.  The depository institution whose insured status is terminating shall  continue to file and certify its quarterly certified statement invoice  and pay assessments for the assessment period its deposits are insured.  Such institution shall not be required to certify its quarterly  certified statement invoice and pay further assessments after it has  paid in full its deposit liabilities and the assessment to the  Corporation required to be paid for the assessment period in which its  deposit liabilities are paid in full, and after it, under applicable  law, goes out of business or transfers all or substantially all of its  assets and liabilities to other institutions or otherwise ceases to be  obliged to pay subsequent assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment of deposits; certification to Corporation. When the  deposit liabilities of the depository institution have been paid in  full, the depository institution shall certify to the Corporation that  the deposit liabilities have been paid in full and give the date of the  final payment. When the depository institution has unclaimed deposits,  the certification shall further state the amount of the unclaimed  deposits and the disposition made of the funds to be held to meet the  claims. For assessment purposes, the following will be considered as  payment of the unclaimed deposits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transfer of cash funds in an amount sufficient to pay the  unclaimed and unpaid deposits to the public official authorized by law  to receive the same; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no law provides for the transfer of funds to a public  official, the transfer of cash funds or compensatory assets to an  insured depository institution in an amount sufficient to pay the  unclaimed and unpaid deposits in consideration for the assumption of the  deposit obligations by the insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice to depositors. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The depository institution whose  insured status is terminating shall give sufficient advance notice of  the intended transfer to the owners of the unclaimed deposits to enable  the depositors to obtain their deposits prior to the transfer. The  notice shall be mailed to each depositor and shall be published in a  local newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall advise the  depositors of the liquidation of the depository institution, request  them to call for and accept payment of their deposits, and state the  disposition to be made of their deposits if they fail to promptly claim  the deposits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the unclaimed and unpaid deposits are disposed of as  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a certified copy of the  public official's receipt issued for the funds shall be furnished to the  Corporation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the unclaimed and unpaid deposits are disposed of as  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an affidavit of the  publication and of the mailing of the notice to the depositors, together  with a copy of the notice and a certified copy of the contract of  assumption, shall be furnished to the Corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notice to Corporation. The depository institution whose insured  status is terminating shall advise the Corporation of the date on which  it goes out of business or transfers all or substantially all of its  assets and liabilities to other institutions or otherwise ceases to be  obligated to pay subsequent assessments and the method whereby the  termination has been effected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resumption of insured status before insurance of deposits  ceases. If a depository institution whose insured status has been  terminated is permitted by the Corporation to continue or resume its  status as an insured depository institution before the insurance of its  deposits has ceased, the institution will be deemed, for assessment  purposes, to   continue as an insured depository institution and must thereafter file  and certify its quarterly certified statement invoices and pay  assessments as though its insured status had not been terminated. The  procedure for applying for the continuance or resumption of insured  status is set forth in Sec. 303.248 of this chapter.  [76 FR 10706, Feb. 25, 2011]</p>
