                            <p class="depth0">All testing activities shall be conducted in accordance with a  Testing Plan submitted by the lessee and approved by the Director. Where  a lessee needs more information to develop a detailed Mining Plan than  is obtainable under an approved Delineation Plan, to prepare feasibility  studies, to carry out a pilot program to evaluate processing techniques  or technology or mining equipment, or to determine environmental effects  by a pilot test mining operation, the lessee shall submit a  comprehensive Testing Plan for the Director's approval. Any OCS minerals  acquired during activities conducted under an approved Testing Plan will  be subject to the payment of royalty pursuant to the governing lease  terms. A Testing Plan at a minimum shall include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The nature and purpose of the proposed testing program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A comprehensive description of the activities to be performed  including descriptions of the proposed methods for analysis of samples  taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A narrative description and maps showing water depths and the  locations of the proposed pilot mining or other testing activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A comprehensive description of the method and manner in which  testing activities will be conducted and the results the lessee expects  to obtain as a result of those activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The name, registration, and type of equipment to be used,  including vessel types together with their navigation and mobile  communication systems, and transportation corridors to be used between  the lease and shore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information showing that the equipment to be used (including the  vessel) is capable of performing the intended operation in the  environment which will be encountered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A schedule specifying the starting and completion dates for each  of the testing activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A list of known archaeological resources on the lease and  measures to be used to assure that the proposed testing activities do  not damage those resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A description of any potential conflicts with other uses and  users of the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A description of measures to be taken to avoid, minimize, or  otherwise mitigate air, land, and water pollution and damage to aquatic  and wildlife species and their habitat; any unique or special features  in the lease area, other natural resources of the OCS; and hazards to  public health, safety, and navigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A description of the measures to be taken to monitor the impacts  of the proposed testing activities in accordance with Sec.  582.28(c) of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A detailed description of the cycle of all materials including  samples and wastes, the method for discharge and disposal of waste and  refuse, and the chemical and physical characteristics of such waste and  refuse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A detailed description of practices and procedures to effect the  abandonment of testing activities, e.g., abandonment of a pilot mining  facility. The proposed procedures shall indicate the steps to be taken  to assure that mined areas do not pose a threat to the environment and  that the seafloor is left free of obstructions and structures that may  present a hazard to other uses or users of the OCS such as navigation or  commercial fishing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A description of potential environmental impacts of testing  activities including the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The location of associated port, transport, processing, and  waste disposal facilities and affected environment (e.g., maps, land  use, and layout);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the nature and degree of potential  environmental impacts of the proposed testing activities and the  domestic socioeconomic effects of construction and operation of the  proposed testing facilities, including waste characteristics and  toxicity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any proposed mitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse  impacts on the environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A certificate of consistency with the federally approved State  coastal zone management program, where applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alternate sites and technologies considered by the lessee and  the reasons why they were not selected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Any other information needed for technical evaluation of the  planned activities and for evaluation of the impact of those activities  on the human, marine, and coastal environments.</p>
