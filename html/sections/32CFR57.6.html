A developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction that adversely affects a child's educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. Essential features are typically but not necessarily manifested before age 3.

The term does not apply if a child's educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deafness.

A combination of hearing and visual impairments causing such severe communication, developmental, and educational needs that the child cannot be accommodated in programs specifically for children with deafness or children with blindness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Developmental delay. A significant discrepancy, as defined and measured in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) and confirmed by clinical observation and judgment, in the actual functioning of a child, birth through age 7, or any subset of that age range including ages 3 through 5, when compared with the functioning of a non-disabled child of the same chronological age in any of the following developmental areas: Physical, cognitive, communication, social or emotional, or adaptive development. A child determined to have a developmental delay before the age of 7 may maintain that eligibility through age 9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emotional disturbance.

An impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance but is not included under the definition of deafness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Intellectual disability.

A severe orthopedic impairment that adversely affects a child's educational performance. That term includes congenital impairments such as club foot or absence of some member; impairments caused by disease, such as poliomyelitis and bone tuberculosis; and impairments from other causes such as cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures or burns causing contractures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Other health impairment. Limited strength, vitality, or alertness including a heightened alertness to environmental stimuli that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment, that is due to chronic or acute health problems and that adversely affects a child's educational performance. Such impairments may include, but are not necessarily limited to, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, heart condition, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, asthma, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, seizure disorder, lead poisoning, leukemia, or diabetes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Specific learning disability. A disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using spoken or written language that may manifest itself as an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, remember, or do mathematical calculations. That term includes such conditions, recognizing that they may have been otherwise labeled with terms such as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. This term does not include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; intellectual disability; emotional disturbance; or environmental, cultural, or economic differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Speech or language impairments. A communication disorder such as stuttering; impaired articulation; limited, impaired or delayed capacity to use expressive and/or receptive language; or a voice impairment that adversely affects a child's educational performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Traumatic brain injury. An acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in total or partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment (or both) that adversely affects educational performance. Includes open or closed head injuries resulting in impairments in one or more areas including cognition, language, memory, attention, reasoning, abstract thinking, judgment, problem solving, sensory, perceptual and motor abilities, psychosocial behavior, physical function, information processing, and speech. The term does not include brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative or brain injuries that are induced by birth trauma.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Visual impairment, including blindness. An impairment of vision that, even with correction, adversely affects a child's educational performance. Term includes both partial sight and blindness. DoD also recognizes that a child may be eligible for services under paragraph (b) if they demonstrate ``Multiple Disabilities'' which DoD defines as: ``Concomitant impairments (such as intellectual disability-blindness or intellectual disability-orthopedic impairment), the combination of which causes such severe educational needs that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for one of the impairments. Multiple disabilities does not include deaf-blindness, which is set forth as its own type of disability at Sec. 57.6(g)(3).</p>
