                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination by a manufacturer. Not later than 5 working days after a manufacturer determines to conduct a safety recall or other safety campaign in a foreign country covering a motor vehicle, item of motor vehicle equipment, or tire that is identical or substantially similar to a vehicle, item of equipment, or tire sold or offered for sale in the United States, the manufacturer shall report the determination to NHTSA. For purposes of this paragraph, this period is determined by reference to the general business practices of the office in which such determination is made, and the office reporting to NHTSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination by a foreign government. Not later than 5 working days after a manufacturer receives written notification that a foreign government has determined that a safety recall or other safety campaign must be conducted in its country with respect to a motor vehicle, item of motor vehicle equipment, or tire that is identical or substantially similar to a vehicle, item of equipment, or tire sold or offered for sale in the United States, the manufacturer shall report the determination to NHTSA. For purposes of this paragraph, this period is determined by reference to the general business practices of the office where the manufacturer receives such notification, the manufacturer's international headquarters office (if involved), and the office reporting to NHTSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> One-time historical reporting. Not later than 30 calendar days after November 12, 2002, a manufacturer that has made a determination to conduct a recall or other safety campaign in a foreign country, or that has received written notification that a foreign government has determined that a safety recall or other safety campaign must be conducted in its country in the period between November 1, 2000 and November 12, 2002, and that has not reported such determination or notification of determination to NHTSA in a report that identified the model(s) and model year(s) of the vehicles, equipment, or tires that were the subject of the foreign recall or other safety campaign, the model(s) and model year(s) of the vehicles, equipment, or tires that were identical or substantially similar to the subject of the recall or campaign, and the defect or other condition that led to the foreign recall or campaign, as of November 12, 2002, shall report such determination or notification of determination to NHTSA if the safety recall or other safety campaign covers a motor vehicle, item of motor vehicle equipment, or tire that is identical or substantially similar to a vehicle, item of equipment, or tire sold or offered for sale in the United States. However, a report need not be resubmitted under this paragraph if the original report identified the model(s) and model year(s) of the vehicles, equipment, or tires that were the subject of the foreign recall or other safety campaign, identified the model(s) and model year(s) of the identical or substantially similar products in the United States, and identified the defect or other condition that led to the foreign recall or other safety campaign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions from reporting. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section a manufacturer need not report a foreign safety recall or other safety campaign to NHTSA if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer has determined that for the same or substantially similar reasons relating to motor vehicle safety that it is conducting a safety recall or other safety campaign in a foreign country, a safety-related defect or noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard exists in identical or substantially similar motor vehicles, motor vehicle equipment, or tires sold or offered for sale in the United States, and has filed a defect or noncompliance information report pursuant to part 573 of this chapter, provided that the scope of the foreign recall or campaign is not broader than the scope of the recall campaign in the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The component or system that gave rise to the foreign recall or other campaign does not perform the same function in any substantially similar vehicles or equipment sold or offered for sale in the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sole subject of the foreign recall or other campaign is a label affixed to a vehicle, item of equipment, or a tire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual list of substantially similar vehicles. Not later than November 1 of each year, each manufacturer of motor vehicles that sells or offers a motor vehicle for sale in the United States shall submit to NHTSA a document that identifies both each model of motor vehicle that the manufacturer sells or plans to sell during the following year in a foreign country that the manufacturer believes is identical or substantially similar to a motor vehicle sold or offered for sale in the United States (or to a motor vehicle that is planned for sale in the United States in the following year), and each such identical or substantially similar motor vehicle sold or offered for sale in the United States. Not later than 30 days after January 28, 2003, each manufacturer to which this paragraph applies shall submit an initial annual list of vehicles for calendar year 2003 that meets the requirements of this paragraph.
