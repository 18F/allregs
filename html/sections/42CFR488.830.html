If the HHA is no longer in compliance with the  conditions of participation, either because the deficiency or  deficiencies substantially limit the provider's capacity to furnish  adequate care but do not pose immediate jeopardy, have a condition-level  deficiency or deficiencies that do not pose immediate jeopardy, or  because the HHA has repeat noncompliance that results in a condition- level deficiency based on the HHA's failure to correct and sustain  compliance, CMS will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Terminate the HHA's provider agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Impose one or more alternative sanctions set forth in Sec.  488.820(a) through (f) of this part as an alternative to termination,  for a period not to exceed 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 15-day notice. Except for civil money penalties, for all  sanctions specified in Sec. 488.820 imposed when there is no immediate  jeopardy, notice must be given at least 15 calendar days before the  effective date of the enforcement action. The requirements of the notice  are set forth in Sec. 488.810(f) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not meeting criteria for continuation of payment. If an HHA does  not meet the criteria for continuation of payment under Sec. 488.860(a)  of this part, CMS will terminate the HHA's provider agreement in  accordance with Sec. 488.865 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination time frame when there is no immediate jeopardy. CMS  terminates an HHA within 6 months of the last day of the survey, if the  HHA is not in compliance with the conditions of participation, and the  terms of the plan of correction have not been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transfer of care. An HHA, if its provider agreement terminated,  is responsible for providing information, assistance, and arrangements  necessary for the proper and safe transfer of patients to another local  HHA within 30 days of termination. The State must assist the HHA in the  safe and orderly transfer of care and services for the patients to  another local HHA.</p>
