                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The drug is a liquid containing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 3 percent of fenthion; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 20 percent fenthion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The drug is a solution containing either 5.6 or 13.8 percent  fenthion. Each concentration is available in 2 volumes which are  contained in single-dose applicators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sponsor. See sponsors in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Related tolerances. See 40 CFR 180.214.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions of use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beef cattle and nonlactating dairy  cattle--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amount. It is used at the rate of one-half fluid ounce per  100 pounds of body weight applied topically on the backline of the  animal. Only one application per season should be made for grub control  and this will also provide initial control of lice. A second application  for lice control may be made if animals become reinfested, but no sooner  than 35 days after the first treatment. Proper timing of treatment is  important for grub control; cattle should be treated as soon as possible  after heel-fly activity ceases.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indications for use. For the control of grubs and lice in beef  and nonlactating cattle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Limitations. Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a  few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase- inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Cattle should not be  slaughtered within 35 days following a single treatment. If a second  application is made for lice control, cattle should not be slaughtered  within 45 days of the second treatment. The drug must not be used within  28 days of freshening of dairy cattle. If freshening should occur within  28 days after treatment, do not use milk as human food for the balance  of the 28-day interval. Do not treat lactating dairy cattle; calves less  than 3 months old; or sick, convalescent, or stressed livestock. Do not  treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, or dehorning  or after exposure to contagious infectious diseases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beef cattle and dairy cattle not of breeding age--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amount. It  is administered as a single, topical application placed on the backline  of animals as follows: For animals weighing 150 to 300 pounds, apply 4  milliliters (mL); for animals weighing 301 to 600 pounds, apply 8 mL;  for animals weighing 601 to 900 pounds, apply 12 mL; for animals  weighing 901 to 1,200 pounds, apply 16 mL; and for animal weighing over  1,200 pounds, apply 20 mL. For most effective results, cattle should be  treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases. A second  application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for  those which become reinfested. A second application should be made no  sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indications for use. For control of cattle grubs and as an aid  in controlling lice on beef cattle and on dairy cattle not of breeding  age.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Limitations. Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a  few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase- inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Host-parasite reactions such  as bloat, salivation, staggering and paralysis may sometimes occur when  cattle are treated while the common cattle grub (Hypoderma lineatum) is  in the gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (H. bovis) is in the  area of the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of  grub development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock  specialist, or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment.  If it is impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came  and/or exact stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle  receive only a maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the  treatment period. This lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may  occur in cattle on full feed when the common grub is killed while in the  gullet. Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3  months old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock. Do not  treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, dehorning,  or after exposure to contagious or infectious diseases. Do not slaughter  within 45 days of treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dogs--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amount. Four to 8 milligrams per kilogram of body  weight. Apply the contents of the proper size, single-dose tube directly  to one spot on the dog's skin.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indications for use. For flea control on dogs only.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Limitations. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on  the order of a licensed veterinarian.
