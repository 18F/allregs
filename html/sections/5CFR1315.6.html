                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In limited situations, payment may be made without evidence that  supplies have been received. Instead, a contractor certification that  supplies have been shipped may be used as the basis for authorizing  payment. Payment may be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of  the invoice. This payment procedure may be employed only when all of the  following conditions are present:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual orders do not exceed $25,000 (except where agency  heads permits a higher amount on a case-by-case basis);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deliveries of supplies are to occur where there is both a  geographical separation and a lack of adequate communications facilities  between Government receiving and disbursing activities that make it  impracticable to make timely payments based on evidence of Federal  acceptance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Title to supplies will vest in the Government upon delivery to a  post office or common carrier for mailing or shipment to destination or  upon receipt by the Government if the shipment is by means other than  the Postal Service or a common carrier; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contractor agrees to replace, repair, or correct supplies  not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to  purchase requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies shall promptly inspect and accept supplies acquired  under these procedures and shall ensure that receiving reports and  payment documents are matched and steps are taken to correct  discrepancies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agencies shall ensure that specific internal controls are in  place to assure that supplies paid for are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As authorized by the 1988 Amendment to the Prompt Payment Act  (Section 11(b)(1)(C)), a contract clause at 48   CFR 52.213-1 is provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) at  48 CFR part 13, subpart 13.4 ``Fast Payment Procedure,'' for use when  using this fast payment procedure.</p>
