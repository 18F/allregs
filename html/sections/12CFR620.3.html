No institution and no employee, officer, director, or nominee for director of the institution shall make any disclosure to shareholders or the general public concerning any matter required to be disclosed by this part that is incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading. When any such person makes disclosure that, in the judgment of the Farm Credit Administration, is incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading, whether or not such disclosure is made in disclosure statements required by this part, such institution or person shall make such additional or corrective disclosure as is necessary to provide shareholders and the general public with a full and fair disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signatures.

If any signatory is unable to, or refuses to, certify the report, the institution must disclose the individual's name and position title and the reason(s) such individual is unable or refuses to certify the report. At a minimum, the certification must include a statement that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The signatories have reviewed the report,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The report has been prepared in accordance with all applicable statutory or regulatory requirements, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The information is true, accurate, and complete to the best of signatories' knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Management assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Annual reports of those institutions with over $1 billion in total assets (as of the end of the prior fiscal year) must include a report by management assessing the effectiveness of the institution's internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must be conducted during the reporting period and be reported to the institution's board of directors.
