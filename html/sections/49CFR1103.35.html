No person should be held as a practitioner who is not duly qualified under Sec.  1103.2 or Sec.  1103.3 of these rules. No person who is not duly admitted to practice should be held out in a way which will give the impression that he is so admitted. No false or assumed or trade name should be used to disguise the practitioner or his partnership or professional corporation.</p>
