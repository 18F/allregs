No person  should be held as a practitioner who is not duly qualified under Sec.   1103.2 or Sec.  1103.3 of these rules. No person who is not duly  admitted to practice should be held out in a way which will give the  impression that he is so admitted. No false or assumed or trade name  should be used to disguise the practitioner or his partnership or  professional corporation.</p>
