                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NEPA process for proposals for legislation (Sec.  1508.17) significantly affecting the quality of the human environment shall be integrated with the legislative process of the Congress. A legislative environmental impact statement is the detailed statement required by law to be included in a recommendation or report on a legislative proposal to Congress. A legislative environmental impact statement shall be considered part of the formal transmittal of a legislative proposal to Congress; however, it may be transmitted to Congress up to 30 days later in order to allow time for completion of an accurate statement which can serve as the basis for public and Congressional debate. The statement must be available in time for Congressional hearings and deliberations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of a legislative environmental impact statement shall conform to the requirements of these regulations except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There need not be a scoping process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legislative statement shall be prepared in the same manner as a draft statement, but shall be considered the ``detailed statement'' required by statute; Provided, That when any of the following conditions exist both the draft and final environmental impact statement on the legislative proposal shall be prepared and circulated as provided by Sec. Sec.  1503.1 and 1506.10.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A Congressional Committee with jurisdiction over the proposal has a

rule requiring both draft and final environmental impact statements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proposal results from a study process required by statute (such as those required by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) and the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Legislative approval is sought for Federal or federally assisted construction or other projects which the agency recommends be located at specific geographic locations. For proposals requiring an environmental impact statement for the acquisition of space by the General Services Administration, a draft statement shall accompany the Prospectus or the 11(b) Report of Building Project Surveys to the Congress, and a final statement shall be completed before site acquisition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The agency decides to prepare draft and final statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Comments on the legislative statement shall be given to the lead agency which shall forward them along with its own responses to the Congressional committees with jurisdiction.</p>
