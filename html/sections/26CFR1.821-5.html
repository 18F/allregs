In the case of a company described in section 821(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section the statutory underwriting income for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sum of the underwriting losses of such company for the five taxable years immediately preceding January 1, 1962, exceeds</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total amount by which the company's statutory underwriting income was reduced by reason of section 821(f) and this section for prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Underwriting loss defined.
