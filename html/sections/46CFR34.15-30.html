The alarm shall be conspicuously and centrally located and shall be marked as required by Sec. 35.40-7 of this subchapter. Such alarms shall be so arranged as to sound during the 20-second delay period prior to the discharge of carbon dioxide into the space, and the alarm shall depend on no source of power other than the carbon dioxide.</p>
