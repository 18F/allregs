                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, there are limits on what DOE must consider in the  performance assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  and 197.30, except as stipulated in paragraph (b) of this section. In  addition, unless otherwise specified in these standards or NRC  regulations, DOE's performance assessments need not evaluate the impacts  resulting from features, events, and processes or sequences of events  and processes with a higher chance of occurring if the results of the  performance assessments would not be changed significantly in the  initial 10,000-year period after disposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, with additional considerations as stipulated in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and 197.30, DOE's performance assessments shall  exclude unlikely features, events, or processes, or sequences of events  and processes. The DOE should use the specific probability of the  unlikely features, events, and processes as specified by NRC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For performance assessments conducted to show compliance with  Sec. Sec. 197.20(a)(2) and 197.25(b)(2), DOE's performance assessments  shall project the continued effects of the features, events, and  processes included in paragraph (a) of this section beyond the 10,000- year post-disposal period through the period of geologic stability. The  DOE must evaluate all of the features, events, or processes included in  paragraph (a) of this section, and also:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DOE must assess the effects of seismic and igneous  scenarios, subject to the probability limits in paragraph (a) of this  section for very unlikely features, events, and processes. Performance  assessments conducted to show compliance with Sec. 197.25(b)(2) are  also subject to the probability limits for unlikely features, events,  and processes as specified by NRC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The seismic analysis may be limited to the effects caused by  damage to the drifts in the repository, failure of the waste packages,  and changes in the elevation of the water table under Yucca Mountain.  NRC may determine the magnitude of the water table rise and its  significance on the results of the performance assessment, or NRC may  require DOE to demonstrate the magnitude of the water table rise and its  significance in the license application. If NRC determines that the  increased elevation of the water table does not significantly affect the  results of the performance assessment, NRC may choose to not require its  consideration in the performance assessment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The igneous analysis may be limited to the effects of a  volcanic event directly intersecting the repository. The igneous event  may be limited to that causing damage to the waste packages directly,  causing releases of radionuclides to the biosphere, atmosphere, or  ground water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DOE must assess the effects of climate change. The climate  change analysis may be limited to the effects   of increased water flow through the repository as a result of climate  change, and the resulting transport and release of radionuclides to the  accessible environment. The nature and degree of climate change may be  represented by constant climate conditions. The analysis may commence at  10,000 years after disposal and shall extend through the period of  geologic stability. The NRC shall specify in regulation the values to be  used to represent climate change, such as temperature, precipitation, or  infiltration rate of water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The DOE must assess the effects of general corrosion on  engineered barriers. The DOE may use a constant representative corrosion  rate throughout the period of geologic stability or a distribution of  corrosion rates correlated to other repository parameters.
