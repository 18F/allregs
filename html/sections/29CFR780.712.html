                            <p class="depth0">If the operations of an establishment are such that it is commonly  recognized as a country elevator, its employees may come within the  section 13(b)(14) exemption provided that ``no more than five employees  are employed in the establishment in such operations''. The exemption is  intended, as explained by its sponsor, to ``affect   only institutions that have five employees or less'' (107 Cong. Rec.  (daily ed.) p. 5883). Since the Act is applied on a workweek basis, a  country elevator is not an exempt place of work in any workweek in which  more than five employees are employed in its operations.</p>
