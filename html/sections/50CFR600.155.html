The Region will  forward the request to the NOAA FOIA Officer to secure a FOIA number and  log the request into FOIAonline. The Region will also obtain clearance  from the NOAA General Counsel's Office concerning initial determination  for denial of requested information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FOIA request processing will be controlled and documented in the  Region. The requests should be forwarded to the NOAA FOIA Officer who  will enter the request into FOIAonline. The request will be assigned an  official FOIA number and due date. In the event the Region determines  that the requested information is exempt from disclosure, in full or in  part, under the FOIA, the denial letter prepared for the Assistant  Administrator's signature, along with the ``Foreseeable Harm'' Memo and  list of documents to be withheld, must be cleared through the NMFS FOIA  Liaison. Upon completion, a copy of the signed letter transmitting the  information to the requester should be posted to FOIAonline by NMFS.</p>
