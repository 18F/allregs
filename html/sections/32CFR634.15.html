                                Sec. 634.15  Restricted driving privileges or probation.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and DLA, the installation  commander, or his or her designee may modify a suspension or revocation  of driving privileges in certain cases per paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Army requests for restricted driving privileges subsequent to  suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges will be  referred to the installation commander or designee, except for  intoxicated driving cases, which must be referred to the General Court  Martial Convening Authority. Withdrawal of restricted driving privileges  is within the installation commander's discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Probation or restricted driving privileges will not be granted  to any person whose driver license or right to operate motor vehicles is  under suspension or revocation by a state, Federal, or host nation  licensing authority. Prior to application for probation or restricted  driving privileges, a state, Federal, or host nation driver's license or  right to operate motor vehicles must be reinstated. The burden of proof  for reinstatement of driving privileges lies with the person applying  for probation or restricted driving privileges. Revocations for test  refusals shall remain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The installation commander or designee may grant restricted  driving privileges or probation on a case-by-case basis provided the  person's state or host nation driver's license or right to operate motor  vehicles remains valid to accommodate any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mission requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unusual personal or family hardships.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Delays exceeding 90 days, not attributed to the person  concerned, in the formal disposition of an apprehension or charges that  are the basis for any type of suspension or revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When there is no reasonably available alternate means of  transportation to officially assigned duties. In this instance, a  limited exception can be granted for the sole purpose of driving  directly to and from the place of duty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The terms and limitations on a restricted driving privilege (for  example, authorization to drive to and from place of employment or duty,  or selected installation facilities such as hospital, commissary, and or  other facilities) will be specified in writing and provided to the  individual concerned. Persons found in violation of the restricted  privilege are subject to revocation action as prescribed in Sec. 634.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The conditions and terms of probation will be specified in  writing and provided to the individual concerned. The original  suspension or revocation term in its entirety may be activated to  commence from the date of the violation of probation. In addition,  separate action may be initiated based on the commission of any traffic,  criminal, or military offense that constitutes a probation violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> DOD employees and contractors, who can demonstrate that  suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges would  constructively remove them from employment, may be given a limiting  suspension/revocation that restricts driving on the installation or  activity (or in the overseas command) to the most direct route to and  from their respective work sites (5 U.S.C. 2302(b) (10)). This is not to  be construed as limiting the commander from suspension or revocation of  on-duty driving privileges or seizure of OF 346, even if this action  would constructively remove a person from employment in those instances  in which the person's duty requires driving from place to place on the  installation.</p>
