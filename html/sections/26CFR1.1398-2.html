                                Sec. 1.1398-2  Treatment of section 465 losses in individuals'
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to cases under chapter 7 or chapter  11 of title 11 of the United States Code, but only if the debtor is an  individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition and rules of general application. For purposes of  this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 465 activity means an activity to which section 465  applies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each section 465 activity, the unused section 465 loss from  the activity (determined as of the first day of a taxable year) is the  loss (as defined in section 465(d)) that is not allowed under section  465(a)(1) for the previous taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Estate succeeds to losses upon commencement of case. The  bankruptcy estate (the estate) succeeds to and takes into account,  beginning with its first taxable year, the debtor's unused section 465  losses (determined as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in  which the case commences).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfers from estate to debtor--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfer not treated as  taxable event. If, before the termination of the estate, the estate  transfers an interest in a section 465 activity to the debtor (other  than by sale or exchange), the transfer is not treated as a disposition  for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code assigning tax  consequences to a disposition. The transfers to which this rule applies  include transfers from the estate to the debtor of property that is  exempt under section 522 of title 11 of the United States   Code and abandonments of estate property to the debtor under section  554(a) of such title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of section 465 losses. If, before the termination of  the estate, the estate transfers an interest in a section 465 activity  to the debtor (other than by sale or exchange) the debtor succeeds to  and takes into account, beginning with the debtor's taxable year in  which the transfer occurs, the transferred interest's share of the  estate's unused section 465 loss from the activity (determined as of the  first day of the estate's taxable year in which the transfer occurs).  For this purpose, the transferred interest's share of such loss is the  amount, if any, by which such loss would be reduced if the transfer had  occurred as of the close of the preceding taxable year of the estate and  been treated as a disposition on which gain or loss is recognized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Debtor succeeds to losses of the estate upon its termination.  Upon termination of the estate, the debtor succeeds to and takes into  account, beginning with the debtor's taxable year in which the  termination occurs, the losses not allowed under section 465 for the  estate's last taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cases commencing on or after November 9,  1992. This section applies to cases commencing on or after November 9,  1992.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cases commencing before November 9, 1992--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Election required.  This section applies to a case commencing before November 9, 1992, and  terminating on or after that date if the debtor and the estate jointly  elect its application in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of  this section (the election). The caption ``ELECTION PURSUANT TO Sec.  1.1398-2'' must be placed prominently on the first page of each of the  debtor's returns that is affected by the election (other than returns  for taxable years that begin after the termination of the estate) and on  the first page of each of the estate's returns that is affected by the  election. In the case of returns that are amended under paragraph  (f)(2)(iii) of this section, this requirement is satisfied by placing  the caption on the amended return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Scope of election. This election applies to the section 465  activities and unused losses from section 465 activities of the  taxpayers making the election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Rules relating to closed years--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Estate succeeds to debtor's  section 465 loss as of the commencement date. If, by reason of an  election under this paragraph (f), this section applies to a case that  was commenced in a closed year, the estate, nevertheless, succeeds to  and takes into account the section 465 losses of the debtor (determined  as of the first day of the debtor's taxable year in which the case  commenced).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> No reduction of unused section 465 loss for loss not claimed for  a closed year. In determining a taxpayer's carryover of an unused  section 465 loss to its taxable year following a closed year, a  deduction that the taxpayer failed to claim in the closed year, if  attributable to an unused section 465 loss to which the taxpayer  succeeds under this section, is treated as a deduction that was not  allowed under section 465.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Loss to which taxpayer succeeds reflects deductions of prior  holder in a closed year. A loss to which a taxpayer would otherwise  succeed under this section is reduced to the extent the loss was allowed  to its prior holder for a closed year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Closed year. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), a  taxable year is closed to the extent the assessment of a deficiency or  refund of an overpayment is prevented, on the date of the election and  at all times thereafter, by any law or rule of law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Manner of making election--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Chapter 7 cases. In a case under  chapter 7 of title 11 of the United States Code, the election is made by  obtaining the   written consent of the bankruptcy trustee and filing a copy of the  written consent with the returns (or amended returns) of the debtor and  the estate for their first taxable years ending after November 9, 1992.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Chapter 11 cases. In a case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the  United States Code, the election is made by incorporating the election  into a bankruptcy plan that is confirmed by the bankruptcy court or into  an order of such court and filing the pertinent portion of the plan or  order with the returns (or amended returns) of the debtor and the estate  for their first taxable years ending after November 9, 1992.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Election is binding and irrevocable. Except as provided in  paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the election, once made, is  binding on both the debtor and the estate and is irrevocable.</p>
