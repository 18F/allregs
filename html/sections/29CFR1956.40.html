                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan designates the Connecticut Department of Labor as the State agency responsible for administering the plan throughout the State. The State has adopted all Federal standards promulgated as of September 1977 and has given assurances that it will continue to adopt all Federal standards, revisions, and amendments. The State further assured that in those situations where public employees are exposed to unique hazards for which existing standards do not provide adequate protection, effective State standards will be adopted. The plan includes legislation, Public Act 73-379, passed by the Connecticut Legislature in 1973 and amended as follows: P.A. 74-176, P.A. 75-285, P.A. 77-107, and P.A. 77-610. Under the legislation the Connecticut Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Division has full authority to enforce and administer all laws and rules protecting the safety and health of employees of the State and its political subdivisions. The plan is accompanied by a statement of the Governor's support and a legal opinion that the Connecticut legislation meets the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and is in accord with the constitution of the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The plan establishes procedures for variances and the protection of employees from hazards under a variance; insures inspection in response to complaints; provides employer and employee representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors and to call attention to possible violations before, during, and after inspections; notification to employees or their representatives when no compliance action is taken as a result of alleged violations, including informal review; notification of employees of their protection; protection of employees against discharge or discrimination in terms and conditions of employment; provision for prompt notices to employers and employees of violations of standards and abatement requirements; sanctions against employers for violation of standards and orders; employer's right to appeal citations for violations, abatement periods and proposed penalties; employee's right to appeal abatement periods; and employee participation in review proceedings. Also included are provisions for right of entry for inspection, ``prohibition'' of advance notice of inspection and the requirement for both employers and employees to comply with the applicable rules, standards, and orders, and employer obligations to maintain records and provide reports as required. Further, the plan provides assurances of a fully trained adequate staff and sufficient funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan includes the following documents as of the date of approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan document and appendixes submitted January 30, 1978;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Letter from the Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Labor,
