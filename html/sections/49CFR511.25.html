Any party may move, with a supporting memorandum, for a  Summary Decision and Order in its favor upon all or any of the issues in  controversy. Complaint Counsel may so move at any time after thirty (30)  days following issuance of a complaint, and any other party may so move  at any time after issuance of a complaint. Any such motion by any party  shall be filed at least twenty (20) days before the date fixed for the  adjudicatory hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Response to motion. Any other party may, within ten (10) days  after service of the motion, file a response thereto with a supporting  memorandum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grounds. A Summary Decision and Order shall be granted if the  pleadings and any testimony upon oral examination, answers to  interrogatories, admissions, and/or affidavits show that there is no  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is  entitled to a Summary Decision and Order as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Legal effect. A Summary Decision and Order upon all the issues  being adjudicated shall constitute the Initial Decision of the Presiding  Officer, and may be appealed to the Administrator in accordance with  Sec. 511.53. A Summary Decision, interlocutory in character, may be  rendered on fewer than all issues and may not be appealed prior to  issuance of the Initial Decision, except in accordance with Sec.  511.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Case not fully adjudicated on motion. A Summary Decision and  Order that does not dispose of the whole case shall include a statement  of those material facts as to which there is no substantial controversy,  and of those material facts that are actually and in good faith  controverted. The Summary Order shall direct such further proceedings as  are just.</p>
