                                Sec. 301.7701-3  Classification of certain business entities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A business entity that is not classified as a  corporation under Sec. 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or  (8) (an eligible entity) can elect its classification for federal tax  purposes as provided in this section. An eligible entity with at least  two members can elect to be classified as either an association (and  thus a corporation under Sec. 301.7701-2(b)(2)) or a partnership, and  an eligible entity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an  association or to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.  Paragraph (b) of this section provides a default classification for an  eligible entity that   does not make an election. Thus, elections are necessary only when an  eligible entity chooses to be classified initially as other than the  default classification or when an eligible entity chooses to change its  classification. An entity whose classification is determined under the  default classification retains that classification (regardless of any  changes in the members' liability that occurs at any time during the  time that the entity's classification is relevant as defined in  paragraph (d) of this section) until the entity makes an election to  change that classification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.  Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for making express  elections. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for  foreign eligible entities. Paragraph (e) of this section provides  special rules for classifying entities resulting from partnership  terminations and divisions under section 708(b). Paragraph (f) of this  section sets forth the effective date of this section and a special rule  relating to prior periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Classification of eligible entities that do not file an  election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Domestic eligible entities. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a  domestic eligible entity is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A partnership if it has two or more members; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a  single owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign eligible entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the entity elects otherwise, a  foreign eligible entity is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one  member does not have limited liability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An association if all members have limited liability; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a  single owner that does not have limited liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of limited liability. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section, a member of a foreign eligible entity has  limited liability if the member has no personal liability for the debts  of or claims against the entity by reason of being a member. This  determination is based solely on the statute or law pursuant to which  the entity is organized, except that if the underlying statute or law  allows the entity to specify in its organizational documents whether the  members will have limited liability, the organizational documents may  also be relevant. For purposes of this section, a member has personal  liability if the creditors of the entity may seek satisfaction of all or  any portion of the debts or claims against the entity from the member as  such. A member has personal liability for purposes of this paragraph  even if the member makes an agreement under which another person  (whether or not a member of the entity) assumes such liability or agrees  to indemnify that member for any such liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>. For special rules  regarding the classification of such entities prior to the effective  date of this section, see paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section, a foreign eligible entity is treated as being in existence  prior to the effective date of this section only if the entity's  classification was relevant (as defined in paragraph (d) of this  section) at any time during the sixty months prior to the effective date  of this section. If an entity claimed different classifications prior to  the effective date of this section, the entity's classification for  purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is the last  classification claimed by the entity. If a foreign eligible entity's  classification is relevant prior to the effective date of this section,  but no federal tax or information return is filed or the federal tax or  information   return does not indicate the classification of the entity, the entity's  classification for the period prior to the effective date of this  section is determined under the regulations in effect on the date prior  to the effective date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time and place for filing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except  as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, an  eligible entity may elect to be classified other than as provided under  paragraph (b) of this section, or to change its classification, by  filing Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with the service  center designated on Form 8832. An election will not be accepted unless  all of the information required by the form and instructions, including  the taxpayer identifying number of the entity, is provided on Form 8832.  See Sec. 301.6109-1 for rules on applying for and displaying Employer  Identification Numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> is not  required to be a signed copy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective date of election. An election made under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section will be effective on the date specified by the  entity on Form 8832 or on the date filed if no such date is specified on  the election form. The effective date specified on Form 8832 can not be  more than 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed and  can not be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is  filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 75 days  prior to the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective  75 days prior to the date it was filed. If an election specifies an  effective date more than 12 months from the date on which the election  is filed, it will be effective 12 months after the date it was filed. If  an election specifies an effective date before January 1, 1997, it will  be effective as of January 1, 1997. If a purchasing corporation makes an  election under section 338 regarding an acquired subsidiary, an election  under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for the acquired subsidiary  can be effective no earlier than the day after the acquisition date  (within the meaning of section 338(h)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Deemed elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exempt organizations. An eligible entity  that has   been determined to be, or claims to be, exempt from taxation under  section 501(a) is treated as having made an election under this section  to be classified as an association. Such election will be effective as  of the first day for which exemption is claimed or determined to apply,  regardless of when the claim or determination is made, and will remain  in effect unless an election is made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section after the date the claim for exempt status is withdrawn or  rejected or the date the determination of exempt status is revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Real estate investment trusts. An eligible entity that files an  election under section 856(c)(1) to be treated as a real estate  investment trust is treated as having made an election under this  section to be classified as an association. Such election will be  effective as of the first day the entity is treated as a real estate  investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> S corporations. An eligible entity that timely elects to be an S  corporation under section 1362(a)(1) is treated as having made an  election under this section to be classified as an association, provided  that (as of the effective date of the election under section 1362(a)(1))  the entity meets all other requirements to qualify as a small business  corporation under section 1361(b). Subject to Sec. 301.7701- 3(c)(1)(iv), the deemed election to be classified as an association will  apply as of the effective date of the S corporation election and will  remain in effect until the entity makes a valid election, under Sec.  301.7701-3(c)(1)(i), to be classified as other than an association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 1, 1998, X, a domestic corporation, purchases a  10% interest in Y, an eligible entity formed under Country A law in  1990. The entity's classification was not relevant to any person for  federal tax or information purposes prior to X's acquisition of an  interest in Y. Thus, Y is not considered to be in existence on the  effective date of this section for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section. Under the applicable Country A statute, all members of Y have  limited liability as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.  Accordingly, Y is classified as an association under paragraph  (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section unless it elects under this paragraph (c)  to be classified as a partnership. To be classified as a partnership as  of July 1, 1998, Y must file a Form 8832 by September 14, 1998. See  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because an election cannot be  effective more than 75 days prior to the date on which it is filed, if Y  files its Form 8832 after September 14, 1998, it will be classified as  an association from July 1, 1998, until the effective date of the  election. In that case, it could not change its classification by  election under this paragraph (c) during the sixty months succeeding the  effective date of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Z is an eligible entity formed under Country B law  and is in existence on the effective date of this section within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Prior to the effective date  of this section, Z claimed to be classified as an association. Unless Z  files an election under this paragraph (c), it will continue to be  classified as an association under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Z files a Form 8832 pursuant to this paragraph (c) to be  classified as a partnership, effective as of the effective date of this  section. Z can file an election to be classified as an association at  any time thereafter, but then would not be permitted to change its  classification by election during the sixty months succeeding the  effective date of that subsequent election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorized signatures--(i) In general. An election made under  paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section must be signed by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each member of the electing entity who is an owner at the time  the election is filed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any officer, manager, or member of the electing entity who is  authorized (under local law or the entity's organizational documents) to  make the election and who represents to having such authorization under  penalties of perjury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Retroactive elections. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section, if an election under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section  is to be effective for any period prior to the time that it is filed,  each person who was an owner between the date the election is to be  effective and the date the election is filed, and who is not an owner at  the time the election is filed, must also sign the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies to elections filed on or after  November 29, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for foreign eligible entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of  relevance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For purposes of this section, a foreign  eligible entity's classification is relevant when its classification  affects the liability of any person for federal tax or information  purposes. For example, a foreign entity's classification would be  relevant if U.S. income was paid to the entity and the determination by  the withholding agent of the amount to be withheld under chapter 3 of  the Internal Revenue Code (if any) would vary depending upon whether the  entity is classified as a partnership or as an association. Thus, the  classification might affect the documentation that the withholding agent  must receive from the entity, the type of tax or information return to  file, or how the return must be prepared. The date that the  classification of a foreign eligible entity is relevant is the date an  event occurs that creates an obligation to file a federal tax return,  information return, or statement for which the classification of the  entity must be determined. Thus, the classification of a foreign entity  is relevant, for example, on the date that an interest in the entity is  acquired which will require a U.S. person to file an information return  on Form 5471.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed relevance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. For purposes of this  section, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section,  the classification for Federal tax purposes of a foreign eligible entity  that files Form 8832, ``Entity Classification Election'', shall be  deemed to be relevant only on the date the entity classification  election is effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception. If the classification of a foreign eligible entity is  relevant within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, then  the rule in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section when the classification of the  entity first becomes relevant (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule when classification is no longer relevant. If the  classification of a foreign eligible entity is not relevant (as defined  in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for 60 consecutive months, then the  entity's classification will initially be determined pursuant to the  provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section when the classification  of the foreign eligible entity becomes relevant (as defined in paragraph  (d)(1)(i) of this section). The date that the classification of a  foreign entity is not relevant is the date an event occurs that causes  the classification to no longer be relevant, or, if no event occurs in a  taxable year that causes the classification to be relevant, then the  date is the first day of that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of  this section apply on or after October 22, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with section 708(b). Except as provided in Sec.  301.7701-2(d)(3) (regarding termination of grandfather status for  certain foreign business entities), an entity resulting from a  transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) (partnership termination  due to sales or exchanges) or section 708(b)(2)(B) (partnership  division) is a partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Changes in number of members of an entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Associations. The  classification of an eligible entity as an association is not affected  by any change in the number of members of the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the deemed  transactions in paragraph (g) of this section resulting from the  elective change preempt the transactions that would result from the  change in membership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect on sixty month limitation. A change in the number of  members of an entity does not result in the creation of a new entity for  purposes of the sixty month limitation on elections under paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a U.S. person, owns a domestic eligible entity that is  disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. On January 1, 1998, B,  a U.S. person, buys a 50 percent interest in the entity from A. Under  this paragraph (f), the entity is classified as a partnership when B  acquires an interest in the entity. However, A and B elect to have the  entity classified as an association effective on January 1, 1998. Thus,  B is treated as buying shares of stock on January 1, 1998. (Under  paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, this election is treated as a  change in classification so that the entity generally cannot change its  classification by election again during the sixty months succeeding the  effective date of the election.) Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section,  A is treated as contributing the assets and liabilities of the entity to  the newly formed association immediately before the close of December  31, 1997. Because A does not retain control of the association as  required by section 351, A's contribution will be a taxable event.  Therefore, under section 1012, the association will take a fair market  value basis in the assets contributed by A, and A will have a fair  market value basis in the stock received. A will have no additional gain  upon the sale of stock to B, and B will have a cost basis in the stock  purchased from A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, and X does  not make an election to be classified as a partnership. A subsequently  purchases all of B's interest in X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, X continues to be  classified as an association. X, however, can subsequently elect to be  disregarded as an entity separate from A. The sixty month limitation of  paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section does not prevent X from making an  election because X has not made a prior election under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, and X does  not make an election to be classified as a partnership. On January 1,  1999, X elects to be classified as a partnership effective on that date.  Under the sixty month limitation of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this  section, X cannot elect to be classified as an association until January  1, 2004 (i.e., sixty months after the effective date of the election to  be classified as a partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On June 1, 2000, A purchases all of B's interest in X. After  A's purchase of B's interest, X can no longer be classified as a  partnership because X has only one member. Under paragraph (f)(2) of  this section, X is disregarded as an entity separate from A when A  becomes the only member of X. X, however, is not treated as a new entity  for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. As a result, the  sixty month limitation of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section continues  to apply to X, and X cannot elect to be classified as an association  until January 1, 2004 (i.e., sixty months after January 1, 1999, the  effective date of the election by X to be classified as a partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (f) applies as of November 29,  1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Elective changes in classification--(1) Deemed treatment of  elective change--(i) Partnership to association. If an eligible entity  classified as a partnership elects under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section to be classified as an association, the following is deemed to  occur: The partnership contributes all of its assets and liabilities to  the association in exchange for stock in the association, and  immediately thereafter, the partnership liquidates by distributing the  stock of the association to its partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Association to partnership. If an eligible entity classified as  an association elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be  classified as a partnership, the following is deemed to occur: The  association distributes all of its assets and liabilities to its  shareholders in liquidation of the association, and immediately  thereafter, the shareholders contribute all of the distributed assets  and liabilities to a newly formed partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Association to disregarded entity. If an eligible entity  classified as an association elects under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section to be disregarded as an entity separate from its   owner, the following is deemed to occur: The association distributes all  of its assets and liabilities to its single owner in liquidation of the  association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disregarded entity to an association. If an eligible entity  that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner elects under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to be classified as an association,  the following is deemed to occur: The owner of the eligible entity  contributes all of the assets and liabilities of the entity to the  association in exchange for stock of the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of elective changes--(i) In general. The tax treatment of  a change in the classification of an entity for federal tax purposes by  election under paragraph (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section is determined under  all relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and general  principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> retroactively to elections filed before  December 17, 2001, if the corporate owner claiming treatment under  section 332 and its subsidiary making the election take consistent  positions with respect to the federal tax consequences of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing of election--(i) In general. An election under paragraph  (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section that changes the classification of an eligible  entity for federal tax purposes is treated as occurring at the start of  the day for which the election is effective. Any transactions that are  deemed to occur under this paragraph (g) as a result of a change in  classification are treated as occurring immediately before the close of  the day before the election is effective. For example, if an election is  made to change the classification of an entity from an association to a  partnership effective on January 1, the deemed transactions specified in  paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section (including the liquidation of the  association) are treated as occurring immediately before the close of  December 31 and must be reported by the owners of the entity on December  31. Thus, the last day of the association's taxable year will be  December 31 and the first day of the partnership's taxable year will be  January 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coordination with section 338 election. A purchasing  corporation that makes a qualified stock purchase of an eligible entity  taxed as a corporation may make an election under section 338 regarding  the acquisition if it satisfies the requirements for the election, and  may also make an election to change the classification of the target  corporation. If a taxpayer makes an election under section 338 regarding  its acquisition of another entity taxable as a corporation and makes an  election under paragraph (c) of this section for the acquired  corporation (effective at the earliest possible date as provided by  paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section), the transactions under paragraph  (g) of this section are deemed to occur immediately after the deemed  asset purchase by the new target corporation under section 338.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application to successive elections in tiered situations. When  elections under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for a series of  tiered entities are effective on the same date, the eligible entities  may specify the order of the elections on Form 8832. If no order is  specified for the elections, any transactions that are deemed to occur  in this paragraph (g) as a result of the classification change will be  treated as occurring first for the highest tier entity's classification  change, then for the next highest tier entity's classification change,  and so forth down the chain of entities until all the transactions under  this paragraph (g) have occurred. For example, Parent, a corporation,   wholly owns all of the interest of an eligible entity classified as an  association (S1), which wholly owns another eligible entity classified  as an association (S2), which wholly owns another eligible entity  classified as an association (S3). Elections under paragraph (c)(1)(i)  of this section are filed to classify S1, S2, and S3 each as disregarded  as an entity separate from its owner effective on the same day. If no  order is specified for the elections, the following transactions are  deemed to occur under this paragraph (g) as a result of the elections,  with each successive transaction occurring on the same day immediately  after the preceding transaction S1 is treated as liquidating into  Parent, then S2 is treated as liquidating into Parent, and finally S3 is  treated as liquidating into Parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph  (g)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph (g) applies to elections that  are filed on or after November 29, 1999. Taxpayers may apply this  paragraph (g) retroactively to elections filed before November 29, 1999  if all taxpayers affected by the deemed transactions file consistently  with this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in  this section, the rules of this section are applicable as of January 1,  1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior treatment of existing entities. In the case of a business  entity that is not described in Sec. 301.7701-2(b) (1), (3), (4), (5),  (6), or (7), and that was in existence prior to January 1, 1997, the  entity's claimed classification(s) will be respected for all peri0ods  prior to January 1, 1997, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section  6662) for its claimed classification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The entity and all members of the entity recognized the federal  tax consequences of any change in the entity's classification within the  sixty months prior to January 1, 1997; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Neither the entity nor any member was notified in writing on  or before May 8, 1996, that the classification of the entity was under  examination (in which case the entity's classification will be  determined in the examination).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deemed elections for S corporations. Paragraph (c)(1)(v)(C) of  this section applies to timely S corporation elections under section  1362(a) filed on or after July 20, 2004. Eligible entities that filed  timely S elections before July 20, 2004 may also rely on the provisions  of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec.  301.7701-3, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the  Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.</p>
