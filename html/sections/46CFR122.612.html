If the storage cylinders are separate from the protected space, the instructions must also include a schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of releasing the extinguishing agent should the local manual release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to a distribution line must be marked to indicate the space served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An alarm for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be clearly and conspicuously marked ``WHEN ALARM SOUNDS--VACATE AT ONCE. CARBON DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED.'' Where a different extinguishing agent is installed, that agent shall be marked in place of ``carbon dioxide.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each distribution line valve of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system and the fire main, must be plainly, conspicuously, and permanently marked indicating the space served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A manual fire alarm box must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters ``IN CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An alarm for an automatic fire detecting system or a manual alarm system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters ``FIRE ALARM''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An alarm for an automatic sprinkler system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters ``SPRINKLER ALARM''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An alarm bell for a smoke detecting system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters ``SMOKE DETECTION ALARM''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A control cabinet or space containing valves, manifolds, or controls for any fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters ``CARBON DIOXIDE FIRE EXTINGUISHING APPARATUS'', or as otherwise required by the cognizant OCMI. Where a different extinguishing agent is installed, that agent shall be marked in place of ``carbon dioxide.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Carbon dioxide warning signs. Each entrance to a space storing carbon dioxide cylinders, a space protected by carbon dioxide systems, or any space into which carbon dioxide might migrate must be conspicuously marked as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Spaces storing carbon dioxide--``CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH.
