Affirmation may constitute ``execution'' of the swap or may  provide evidence of execution of the swap, but does not constitute  confirmation (or confirmation by affirmation) of the swap.</p><p class="depth0">Appropriate minimum block size means the minimum notional or  principal amount for a category of swaps that qualifies a swap within  such category as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.</p><p class="depth0">As soon as technologically practicable means as soon as possible,  taking into consideration the prevalence, implementation and use of  technology by comparable market participants.</p><p class="depth0">Asset class means a broad category of commodities including, without  limitation, any ``excluded commodity'' as defined in Section 1a(19) of  the Act, with common characteristics underlying a swap.

A  confirmation shall be in writing (electronic or otherwise) and shall  legally supersede any previous agreement (electronic or otherwise)  relating to the swap.</p><p class="depth0">Confirmation by affirmation means the process by which one party to  a swap acknowledges its assent to the complete swap terms submitted by  the other party to the swap. If the parties to a swap are using a  confirmation service vendor, complete swap terms may be submitted  electronically by a party to such vendor's platform and the other party  may affirm such terms on such platform.</p><p class="depth0">Economically related means a direct or indirect reference to the  same commodity at the same delivery location or locations, or with the  same or a substantially similar cash market price series.</p><p class="depth0">Embedded option means any right, but not an obligation, provided to  one party of a swap by the other party to the swap that provides the  party holding the option with the ability to change any one or more of  the economic terms of the swap as those terms previously were  established at confirmation (or were in effect on the start date).</p><p class="depth0">Executed means the completion of the execution process.</p><p class="depth0">Execution means an agreement by the parties (whether orally, in  writing, electronically, or otherwise) to the terms of a swap that  legally binds the parties to such swap terms under applicable law.  Execution occurs simultaneous with or immediately following the  affirmation of the swap.</p><p class="depth0">Futures-related swap means a swap (as defined in section 1a(47) of  the Act and as further defined by the Commission in implementing  regulations) that is economically related to a futures contract.</p><p class="depth0">Large notional off-facility swap means an off-facility swap that has  a notional or principal amount at or above the appropriate minimum block  size applicable to such publicly reportable swap transaction and is not  a block trade as defined in Sec. 43.2 of the Commission's regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Major currencies means the currencies, and the cross-rates between  the currencies, of Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway,  South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p><p class="depth0">Non-major currencies means all other currencies that are not super- major currencies or major currencies.</p><p class="depth0">Novation means the process by which a party to a swap transfers all  of its rights, liabilities, duties and obligations under the swap to a  new legal party other than the counterparty to the swap. The transferee  accepts all of the transferor's rights, liabilities, duties and  obligations under the swap. A novation is valid as long as the  transferor and the remaining party to the swap are given notice, and the  transferor, transferee and remaining party to the swap consent to the  transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Off-facility swap means any publicly reportable swap transaction  that is not executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap  execution facility or designated contract market.</p><p class="depth0">Other commodity means any commodity that is not categorized in the  other asset classes as may be determined by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Physical commodity swap means a swap in the other commodity asset  class that is based on a tangible commodity.</p><p class="depth0">Public dissemination and publicly disseminate means to publish and  make available swap transaction and pricing data in a non-discriminatory  manner, through the Internet or other electronic data feed that is  widely published and in machine-readable electronic format.</p><p class="depth0">Publicly reportable swap transaction means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise provided in this part--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Any executed swap that is an arm's-length transaction between  two parties that results in a corresponding change in the market risk  position between the two parties; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Any termination, assignment, novation, exchange, transfer,  amendment, conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or obligations of a  swap that changes the pricing of the swap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Examples of executed swaps that do not fall within the  definition of publicly reportable swap may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Internal swaps between one-hundred percent owned subsidiaries of  the same parent entity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Portfolio compression exercises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> These examples represent swaps that are not at arm's length and  thus are not publicly reportable swap transactions, notwithstanding that  they do result in a corresponding change in the market risk position  between two parties.</p><p class="depth2">Real-time public reporting means the reporting of data relating to a  swap transaction, including price and volume, as soon as technologically  practicable after the time at which the swap transaction has been  executed.</p><p class="depth2">Reference price means a floating price series (including derivatives  contract prices and cash market prices or price indices) used by the  parties to a swap or swaption to determine payments made, exchanged or  accrued under the terms of a swap contract.</p><p class="depth2">Remaining party means a party to a swap that consents to a  transferor's transfer by novation of all of the transferor's rights,  liabilities, duties and obligations under such swap to a transferee.</p><p class="depth2">Reporting party means the party to a swap with the duty to report a  publicly reportable swap transaction in accordance with this part and  section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Super-major currencies means the currencies of the European Monetary  Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, and United States.</p><p class="depth2">Swaps with composite reference prices means swaps based on reference  prices that are composed of more than one reference price from more than  one swap category.</p><p class="depth2">Transferee means a party to a swap that accepts, by way of novation,  all of a transferor's rights, liabilities, duties and obligations under  such swap with respect to a remaining party.</p><p class="depth2">Transferor means a party to a swap that transfers, by way of  novation, all of its rights, liabilities, duties and obligations under  such swap, with respect to a remaining party, to a transferee.</p><p class="depth2">Trimmed data set means a data set that has had extraordinarily large  notional transactions removed by transforming the data into a logarithm  with a base of 10, computing the mean, and excluding transactions that  are beyond four standard deviations above the mean.</p><p class="depth2">Unique product identifier means a unique identification of a  particular level of the taxonomy of the product in an asset class or  sub-asset class in question, as further described in   Sec. 43.4(f) and appendix A to this part.
