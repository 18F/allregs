For example, persons having a question  regarding the availability of an exemption may secure informal  administrative interpretations of the applicable statute or rule as they  relate to the particular facts and circumstances presented. Similarly,  persons contemplating filings with the Commission may receive advice of  a general nature as to the preparation thereof, including information as  to the forms to be used and the scope of the items contained in the  forms. Inquiries may be directed to an appropriate officer of the  Commission's   staff. In addition, informal discussions with members of the staff may  be arranged whenever feasible, at the Commission's central office or,  except in connection with certain matters under the Investment Company  Act of 1940, at one of its regional offices.
