                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer is required to compute a separate foreign  tax credit limitation for income received or accrued in a taxable year  that is described in section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive category income),  904(d)(1)(B) (general category income), or Sec. 1.904-4(m) (additional  separate categories).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Passive category income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term passive  category income means passive income and specified passive category  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Passive income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term passive income means  any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Income received or accrued by any person that is of a kind that  would be foreign personal holding company income (as defined in section  954(c)) if the taxpayer were a controlled foreign corporation, including  any amount of gain on the sale or exchange of stock in excess of the  amount treated as a dividend under section 1248; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amount includible in gross income under section 1293.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. Passive income does not include any export  financing interest (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and paragraph (h)  of this section), any high-taxed income (as defined in section  904(d)(2)(F) and paragraph (c) of this section), or any active rents and  royalties (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section). In  addition, passive income does not include any income that would  otherwise be passive but is characterized as income in another separate  category under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3), (d)(4), and  (d)(6)(C) and the regulations under those provisions. In determining  whether any income is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding  company income, the rules of section 864(d)(5)(A)(i) and (6) (treating  related person factoring income of a controlled foreign corporation as  foreign personal holding company income that is not eligible for the  export financing income exception to the separate limitation for passive  income) shall apply only in the case of income of a controlled foreign  corporation (as defined in section 957). Thus, income earned directly by  a United States person that is related   person factoring income may be eligible for the exception for export  financing interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section, the principles of  section 954(c)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> and the regulations under that section shall apply  in determining whether rents or royalties are derived in the active  conduct of a trade or business. For this purpose, the term taxpayer  shall be substituted for the term controlled foreign corporation if the  recipient of the rents or royalties is not a controlled foreign  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, indirect ownership shall be determined  under section 318 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P is a domestic corporation with a branch in foreign  country X. P does not have any financial services income. For 2008, P  has a net foreign currency gain that would not constitute foreign  personal holding company income if P were a controlled foreign  corporation because the gain is directly related to the business needs  of P. The currency gain is, therefore, general category income to P  because it is not income of a kind that would be foreign personal  holding company income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S is regularly engaged in the  restaurant franchise business. P licenses trademarks, tradenames,  certain know-how, related services, and certain restaurant designs for  which S pays P an arm's length royalty. P is regularly engaged in the  development and licensing of such property. The royalties received by P  for the use of its property are allocable under the look-through rules  of Sec. 1.904-5 to the royalties S receives from the franchisees. Some  of the franchisees are unrelated to S and P. Other franchisees are  related to S or P and use the licensed property outside of S's country  of incorporation. S does not satisfy, but P does satisfy, the active  trade or business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) and the  regulations under that section. The royalty income earned by S with  regard to both its related and unrelated franchisees is foreign personal  holding company income because S does not satisfy the active trade or  business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) and, in addition, the  royalty income from the related franchisees does not qualify for the  same country exception of section 954(c)(3). However, all of the royalty  income earned by S is general category income to S under Sec. 1.904- 4(b)(2)(iii) because P, a member of S's affiliated group (as defined  therein), satisfies the active trade or business test (which is applied  without regard to whether the royalties are paid by a related person).  S's royalty income that is taxable to P under subpart F and the  royalties paid to P are general category income to P under the look- through rules of Sec. 1.904-5(c)(1)(i) and (c)(3), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specified passive category income means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends from a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section  992(a)) to the extent such dividends are treated as income from sources  without the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable income attributable to foreign trade income (within the  meaning of section 923(b)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distributions from a FSC (or a former FSC) out of earnings and  profits attributable to foreign trade income (within the meaning of  section 923(b)) or interest or carrying charges (as defined in section  927(d)(1)) derived from a transaction which results in foreign   trade income (as defined in section 923(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> is applicable for taxable  years beginning after March 12, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grouping of items of income in order to determine whether  passive income is high-taxed income</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grouping rules--Initial allocation and apportionment of  deductions and taxes. For purposes of determining whether passive income  is high-taxed, expenses, losses and other deductions shall be allocated  and apportioned initially to each of the groups of passive income  (described in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (5) of this section) under the  rules of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.865-1 through 1.865- 2. Taxpayers that allocate and apportion interest expense on an asset  basis may nevertheless apportion passive interest expense among the  groups of passive income on a gross income basis. Foreign taxes are  allocated to groups under the rules of Sec. 1.904-6(a)(1)(iii). If a  loss on a disposition of property gives rise to foreign tax (i.e., the  transaction giving rise to the loss is treated under foreign law as  having given rise to a gain), the foreign tax shall be allocated to the  group of passive income to which gain on the sale would have been  assigned under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section. A determination  of whether passive income is high-taxed shall be made only after  application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reallocation of loss groups. If, after allocation and  apportionment of expenses, losses and other deductions under paragraph  (c)(2)(i) of this section, the sum of the allocable deductions exceeds  the gross income in one or more groups, the excess deductions shall  proportionately reduce income in the other groups (but not below zero).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>. However, subpart F inclusions that are passive  income, dividends from a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled  section 902 corporation that are passive income, and income that is  earned by a United States person through a foreign QBU that is passive  income shall be subject to the rules of   this paragraph only to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this  section. For purposes of this section, a foreign QBU is a qualified  business unit (as defined in section 989(a)), other than a controlled  foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation, that has  its principal place of business outside the United States. These rules  shall apply whether the income is received from a controlled foreign  corporation of which the United States person is a United States  shareholder, from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation of which the  United States person is a domestic corporation meeting the stock  ownership requirements of section 902(a), or from any other person. For  purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed income, the  following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is  subject to a withholding tax of fifteen percent or greater shall be  treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is  subject to a withholding tax of less than fifteen percent (but greater  than zero) shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is  subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax shall be treated as  one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is  subject to no withholding tax but is subject to a foreign tax other than  a withholding tax shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> shall be applied  separately only to each foreign QBU of that United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income from sources within the QBU's country of operation.  Passive income from sources within the QBU's country of operation shall  be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income from sources without the QBU's country of operation.  Passive income from sources without the QBU's country of operation shall  be grouped on the basis of the tax imposed on that income as provided in  Sec. 1.904-4T(c)(3)(i) through (iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of the source of income. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(4), income will be determined to be from sources within or  without the QBU's country of operation under the laws of the foreign  country of the payor of the income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain rents and royalties. All items of  rent or royalty income to which an item of rent or royalty expense is  directly allocable shall be treated as a single item of income and shall  not be grouped with other amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of partnership income. A partner's distributive share  of income   from a foreign or United States partnership that is not subject to the  look-through rules and that is treated as passive income under Sec.  1.904-5(h)(2)(i) (generally providing that a less than 10 percent  partner's distributive share of partnership income is passive income)  shall be treated as a single item of income and shall not be grouped  with other amounts. A distributive share of income from a foreign  partnership that is treated as passive income under the look-through  rules shall be grouped according to the rules in paragraph (c)(4) of  this section. A distributive share of income from a United States  partnership that is treated as passive income under the look-through  rules shall be grouped according to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of  this section, except that the portion, if any, of the distributive share  of income attributable to income earned by a United States partnership  through a foreign QBU shall be grouped under the rules of paragraph  (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> shall be  applied separately for each foreign QBU of a United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> shall be  applied separately for each foreign QBU of a United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(5)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of S, a  controlled foreign corporation that uses x as its functional currency.  In 1993, S earns 100x of passive foreign personal holding company  income. When included in P's income under subpart F, the exchange rate  is 1x equals $1. Therefore, P's subpart F inclusion is $100. At the end  of 1993, S has previously taxed earnings and profits of 100x and P's  basis in those earnings is $100. In 1994, S has no earnings and  distributes 100x to P. The value of the earnings when distributed is  $150. Assume that under section 986(c), P must recognize $50 of passive  income attributable to the appreciation of the previously taxed income.  Country X does not recognize any gain or loss on the distribution.  Therefore, the section 986(c) gain is not subject to any foreign  withholding tax or other foreign tax. Thus, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)  of this section, the section 986(c) gain shall be grouped with other  items of P's income that are subject to no withholding tax or other  foreign tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coordination with section 954(b)(4). For rules relating to  passive income of a controlled foreign corporation that is exempt from  subpart F treatment because the income is subject to high foreign tax,  see section 904(d)(3)(E), Sec. 1.904-4(c)(7)(iii), and Sec. 1.904- 5(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application of this paragraph to additional taxes paid or deemed  paid in the year of receipt of previously taxed income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Determination made in year of inclusion. The determination of whether an  amount included in gross income under section 951(a) is high-taxed  income shall be made in the taxable year the income is included in the  gross income of the United States shareholder under section 951(a)  (hereinafter the ``taxable year of inclusion''). Any increase in foreign  taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, when the taxpayer  receives an amount that is excluded from gross income under section  959(a) and that is attributable to a controlled foreign corporation's  earnings and profits relating to the amount previously included in gross  income will not be considered in determining   whether the amount included in income in the taxable year of inclusion  is high-taxed income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall not apply  to an increase in tax in a case in which the taxpayer is required to  adjust its foreign taxes in the year of inclusion under section 905(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of foreign taxes imposed on distributions of  previously taxed income. If an item of income is considered high-taxed  income in the year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section  applies, then any increase in foreign income taxes imposed with respect  to that item shall be considered to be related to general category  income. If an item of income is not considered to be high-taxed income  in the taxable year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section  applies, the following rules shall apply. The taxpayer shall treat an  increase in taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, on any  distribution of the earnings and profits attributable to the amount  included in gross income in the taxable year of inclusion as taxes  related to passive income to the extent of the excess of the product of  (A) the highest rate of tax in section 11 (determined with regard to  section 15 and determined as of the year of inclusion) and (B) the  amount of the inclusion (after allocation of parent expenses) over (C)  the taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, in the year of  inclusion. The taxpayer shall treat any taxes paid or accrued, or deemed  paid or accrued, on the distribution in excess of this amount as taxes  related to general category income. If these additional taxes are not  creditable in the year of distribution the carryover rules of section  904(c) apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the foreign tax on a  subpart F inclusion shall be considered increased on distribution of the  earnings and profits associated with that inclusion if the total of  taxes paid and deemed paid on the inclusion and the distribution (taking  into account any reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) is greater  than the total taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Any foreign  currency loss associated with the earnings and profits that are  distributed with respect to the inclusion is not to be considered as  giving rise to an increase in tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increase in taxes paid by successors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Except  as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, if passive  earnings and profits previously included in income of a United States  shareholder are distributed to a person that was not a United States  shareholder of the distributing corporation in the year the earnings  were included, any increase in foreign taxes paid or accrued, or deemed  paid or accrued, on that distribution shall be treated as taxes related  to general category income, regardless of whether the previously-taxed  income was considered high-taxed income under section 904(d)(2)(F) in  the year of inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> (revised as of April 1,  2006).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (c)(6)(iv) applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1986. However, for taxable years  beginning before January 1, 2001, taxpayers may rely on Sec. 1.904- 4(c)(6)(iv) of regulations project INTL-1-92, published at 1992-1 C.B.  1209. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Application of this paragraph to certain reductions of tax on  distributions of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the effective rate of tax  imposed by a foreign country on income of a foreign corporation that is  included in a taxpayer's gross income is reduced under foreign law on  distribution of such income, the rules of this paragraph (c) apply at  the time that the income is included in the taxpayer's gross income  without regard to the possibility of subsequent reduction of foreign tax  on the distribution. If the inclusion is considered to be high-taxed  income, then the taxpayer shall treat the inclusion as general category  income. When the foreign corporation distributes the earnings and  profits to which the inclusion was attributable and the foreign tax on  the inclusion is reduced, then the taxpayer shall redetermine whether  the inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income provided that  a redetermination of United States tax liability is required   under section 905(c). If, taking into account the reduction in foreign  tax, the inclusion would not have been considered high-taxed income,  then the taxpayer, in redetermining its United States tax liability for  the year or years affected, shall treat the inclusion and the associated  taxes (as reduced on the distribution) as passive income and taxes. See  section 905(c) and the regulations thereunder regarding the method of  adjustment. For this purpose, the foreign tax on a subpart F inclusion  shall be considered reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits  associated with the inclusion if the total of taxes paid and deemed paid  on the inclusion and the distribution (taking into account any  reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) is less that the total  taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Any foreign currency gain  associated with the earnings and profits that are distributed with  respect to the inclusion is not to be considered a reduction of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, foreign law is not considered to attribute a reduction in  tax to a particular year or years if foreign law attributes the tax  reduction to a pool or group containing income from more than one  taxable year and such pool or group is defined based on a characteristic  of the income (for example, the rate of tax paid with respect to the  income) rather than on the taxable year in which the income is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, see paragraph (c)(8) Example  (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S is a single qualified business  unit (QBU) operating in foreign country   X. In 1988, S earns $130 of gross passive royalty income from country X  sources, and incurs $30 of expenses that do not include any payments to  P. S's $100 of net passive royalty income is subject to $30 of foreign  tax, and is included under section 951 in P's gross income for the  taxable year. P allocates $50 of expenses to the $100 (consisting of the  $70 section 951 inclusion and $30 section 78 amount), resulting in a net  inclusion of $50. After application of the high-tax kick-out rules of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the $50 inclusion is treated as  general category income, and the $30 of taxes deemed paid are treated as  taxes imposed on general category income, because the foreign taxes paid  and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest United States tax rate  multiplied by the $50 inclusion ($30$17 (.34x$50)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that  instead of earning $130 of gross passive royalty income, S earns $65 of  gross passive royalty income from country X sources and $65 of gross  passive interest income from country Y sources. S incurs $15 of expenses  and $5 of foreign tax with regard to the royalty income and incurs $15  of expenses and $10 of foreign tax with regard to the interest income. P  allocates $50 of expenses pro rata to the $50 inclusion ($45 section 951  inclusion and $5 section 78 amount) attributable to the royalty income  earned by S and the $50 inclusion ($40 section 951 inclusion and $10  section 78 amount) attributable to the interest income earned by S.  Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the high-tax test is applied  separately to the section 951 inclusion attributable to the income from  X sources and the section 951 inclusion attributable to the income from  Y sources. Therefore, after allocation of P's $50 of expenses, the  resulting $25 inclusion attributable to the royalty income from X  sources is still treated as passive income because the foreign taxes  paid and deemed paid on the income do not exceed the highest United  States tax rate multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($5<$8.50 (.34x$25)).  The $25 inclusion attributable to the interest income from Y sources is  treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and  deemed paid exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the  $25 inclusion ($10$8.50 (.34x$25)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation S is a whollyowned  subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S is incorporated and operating in  country Y and has a branch in country Z. S has two QBUs (QBU Y and QBU  Z). In 1988, S earns $65 of gross passive royalty income in country Y  through QBU Y and $65 of gross passive royalty income in country Z  through QBU Z. S allocates $15 of expenses to the gross passive royalty  income earned by each QBU, resulting in net income of $50 in each QBU.  Country Y imposes $5 of foreign tax on the royalty income earned in Y,  and country Z imposes $10 of tax on royalty income earned in Z. All of  S's income constitutes subpart F foreign personal holding company income  that is passive income and is included in P's gross income for the  taxable year. P allocates $50 of expenses pro rata to the $100 subpart F  inclusion attributable to the QBUs (consisting of the $45 section 951  inclusion derived through QBU Y, the $5 section 78 amount attributable  to QBU Y, the $40 section 951 inclusion derived through QBU Z, and the  $10 section 78 amount attributable to QBU Z), resulting in a net  inclusion of $50. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the  high-tax kickout rules must be applied separately to the subpart F  inclusion attributable to the income earned by QBU Y and the income  earned by QBU Z. After application of the high-tax kickout rules, the  $25 inclusion attributable to Y will still be treated as passive income  because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income do not  exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $25  inclusion ($5<$8.50 (.34x$25)). The $25 inclusion attributable to Z will  be treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and  deemed paid on the income exceed the highest United States tax rate  multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($10<=$8.50 (.34x$25)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Domestic corporation M operates in branch form in foreign  countries X and Y. The branches are qualified business units (QBUs),  within the meaning of section 989(a). In 1988, QBU X earns passive  royalty income, interest income and rental income. All of the QBU X  passive income is from Country Z sources. The royalty income is not  subject to a withholding tax, and is not taxed by Country X, and the  interest and the rental income are subject to a 4 percent and 10 percent  withholding tax, respectively. QBU Y earns interest income in Country Y  that is not subject to foreign tax. For purposes of determining whether  M's foreign source passive income is high-taxed income, the rental  income and the interest income earned in QBU X are treated as one item  of income pursuant to paragraphs (c) (4)(ii) and (3)(ii) of this  section. The interest income earned in QBU Y and the royalty income  earned in QBU X are each treated as a separate item of income under  paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (with respect to QBU Y's interest income) and (c)  (4)(ii) and (3)(iii) (with respect to QBU X's royalty income) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. S, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in  foreign country R, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic  corporation. For 1988, P is required under section 951(a) to include in  gross income $80 (not including the section 78 amount) attributable to  the earnings and profits of S for such year, all of which is foreign  personal holding company income that is passive rent or royalty income.  S does not make any distributions in 1988 or 1989. Foreign income   taxes paid by S for 1988 that are deemed paid by P for such year under  section 960(a) with respect to the section 951(a) inclusion equal $20.  Twenty dollars ($20) of P's expenses are properly allocated to the  section 951(a) inclusion. The foreign income tax paid with respect to  the section 951(a) inclusion does not exceed the highest United States  tax rate multiplied by the amount of income after allocation of parent  expenses ($20<$27.20 (.34x$80)). Thus, P's section 951(a) inclusion for  1988 is included in P's passive income and the $20 of taxes attributable  to that inclusion are treated as taxes related to passive income. In  1990, S distributes $80 to P, and under section 959 that distribution is  treated as attributable to the earnings and profits with respect to the  amount included in income by P in 1988 and is excluded from P's gross  income. Foreign country R imposes a withholding tax of $15 on the  distribution in 1990. Under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the  withholding tax in 1990 does not affect the characterization of the 1988  inclusion as passive income nor does it affect the characterization of  the $20 of taxes paid in 1988 as taxes paid with respect to passive  income. No further parent expenses are allocable to the receipt of that  distribution. In 1990, the foreign taxes paid ($15) exceed the product  of the highest United States tax rate and the amount of the inclusion  reduced by taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion  ($15((.34x$80)-$20)). Thus, under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of  this section, $7.20 ((.34x$80)-$20)) of the $15 withholding tax paid in  1990 is treated as taxes related to passive income and the remaining  $7.80 ($15-$7.20) of the withholding tax is treated as related to  general category income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. S, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. P and S are calendar year  taxpayers. In 1987, S's only earnings consist of $200 of passive income  that is foreign personal holding company income that is earned in a  foreign country X. Under country X's tax system, the corporate tax on  particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings and no  withholding tax is imposed. In 1987, S pays $100 of foreign tax. P does  not elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4)  and includes $200 in gross income ($100 of net foreign personal holding  company income and $100 of the section 78 amount). At the time of the  inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed income under  paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6)(i) of this section and is general category  income to P. S does not distribute any of its earnings in 1987. In 1988,  S has no earnings. On December 31, 1988, S distributes the $100 of  earnings from 1987. At that time, S receives a $50 refund from X  attributable to the reduction of the country X corporate tax imposed on  those earnings. Under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, P must  redetermine whether the 1987 inclusion should be considered to be high- taxed income. By taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the  inclusion would not have been considered high-taxed income. Therefore, P  must redetermine its foreign tax credit for 1987 and treat the inclusion  and the taxes associated with the inclusion as passive income and taxes.  P must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that P  elects to apply section 954(b)(4) to S's passive income that is subpart  F income. Although the income is not considered to be subpart F income,  it remains passive income until distribution. In 1988, S distributes  $150 to P. The distribution is a dividend to P because S has $150 of  accumulated earnings and profits (the $100 of earnings in 1987 and the  $50 refund in 1988). P has no expenses allocable to the dividend from S.  In 1988, the income is subject to the high-tax kick-out rules under  paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section. The income is passive income to P  because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid by P with respect to the  income do not exceed the highest United States tax rate on that income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that the  distribution in 1988 is subject to a withholding tax of $25. Under  paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, P must redetermine whether the 1987  inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income because there is  a net $25 reduction of foreign tax. By taking into account both the  reduction in foreign corporate tax and the withholding tax, the  inclusion would continue to be considered high-taxed income. P must  follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures. P must redetermine its  foreign tax credit for 1987, but the inclusion and the $75 taxes ($50 of  deemed paid tax and $25 withholding tax) will continue to be treated as  general category income and taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S, a controlled foreign corporation operating in  country G, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. P  and S are calendar year taxpayers. Country G imposes a tax of 50 percent  on S's earnings. Under country G's system, the foreign corporate tax on  particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings to 30  percent and no withholding tax is imposed. Under country G's law,  distributions are treated as made out of a pool of undistributed  earnings subject to the 50 percent tax rate. For 1987, S's only earnings  consist of passive income that is foreign personal holding company  income that is earned in foreign country G. S has taxable income of $110  for United States purposes and $100 for country G purposes. Country G,  therefore, imposes a tax of $50 on the 1987 earnings of S. P does not  elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) and  includes $110 in gross income ($60 of net foreign   personal holding company income and $50 of the section 78 amount). At  the time of the inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed  income under paragraph (c) of this section and is general category  income to P. S does not distribute any of its taxable income in 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, the distribution,  and, therefore, the reduction of tax is treated as first attributable to  the $60 of passive earnings attributable to income previously taxed in  1987. However, because, under foreign law, only 40 percent (the  reduction in tax rates from 50 percent to 30 percent is a 40 percent  reduction in the tax) of the $50 of foreign taxes on the passive  earnings can be refunded, $20 of the $24 foreign tax refund reduces  foreign taxes on passive earnings. The other $4 of the tax refund  reduces the general category taxes from $50 to $46 (even though for  United States purposes the $60 distribution is entirely out of passive  earnings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, P must redetermine  whether the 1987 inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income.  By taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion would  not have been considered high-taxed income ($30<.34x$110). Therefore, P  must redetermine its foreign tax credit for 1987 and treat the inclusion  and the taxes associated with the inclusion as passive income and taxes.  P must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. P, a domestic corporation, earns $100 of passive royalty  income from sources within the United States. Under the laws of Country  X, however, that royalty is considered to be from sources within Country  X and Country X imposes a 10 percent withholding tax on the payment of  the royalty. P also earns $100 of passive foreign source dividend income  subject to a 10 percent withholding tax to which $15 of expenses are  allocated. In determining whether P's passive income is high-taxed, the  $10 withholding tax on P's royalty income is allocated to passive  income, and within the passive category to the group of income described  in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (passive income subject to a  withholding tax of less than 15 percent (but greater than zero)). For  purposes of determining whether the income is high-taxed, however, only  the foreign source dividend income is taken into account. The foreign  source dividend income will still be treated as passive income because  the foreign taxes paid on the passive income in the group ($20) do not  exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $85 of net  foreign source income in the group ($20 is less than $28.90 ($100- $15)x.34).</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. In 2001, P, a U.S. citizen with a tax home in Country X,  earns the following items of gross income: $400 of foreign source,  passive limitation interest income not subject to foreign withholding  tax but subject to Country X income tax of $100, $200 of foreign source,  passive limitation royalty income subject to a 5 percent foreign  withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $10), $1,300 of foreign source,  passive limitation rental income subject to a 25 percent foreign  withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $325), $500 of foreign source,  general category income that gives rise to a $250 foreign tax, and  $2,000 of U.S. source capital gain that is not subject to any foreign  tax. P has a $900 deduction allocable to its passive rental income. P's  only other deduction is a $700 capital loss on the sale of stock that is  allocated to foreign source passive limitation income under Sec. 1.865- 2(a)(3)(i). The $700 capital loss is initially allocated to the group of  passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to foreign tax  other than withholding tax. The $300 amount by which the capital loss  exceeds the income in the group must be reapportioned to the other  groups under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The royalty income  is thus reduced by $100 to $100 ($200 - ($300x(200/600))) and the rental  income is thus reduced by $200 to $200 ($400 - ($300x(400/600))). The  $100 royalty income is not high-taxed and remains passive income because  the foreign taxes do not exceed the highest United States rate of tax on  that income. Under the high-tax kick-out, the $200 of rental income and  the $325 of associated foreign tax are assigned to the general category  category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. The facts are the same as in Example 11 except the  amount of the capital loss that is allocated under Sec. 1.865- 2(a)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the group of foreign  source passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to  foreign tax other than withholding tax is $1,200. Under paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the excess deductions of $800 must be  reapportioned to the $200 of net royalty income subject to a 5 percent  withholding tax and the $400 of net rental income subject to a 15  percent or greater withholding tax. The income in each of these groups  is reduced to zero, and the foreign taxes imposed on the rental and  royalty income are considered related to general category income. The  remaining loss of $200 constitutes a separate limitation loss with  respect to passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. In 2001, P, a domestic corporation, earns a $100  dividend that is foreign   source passive limitation income subject to a 30-percent withholding  tax. A foreign tax credit for the withholding tax on the dividend is  disallowed under section 901(k). A deduction for the tax is allowed,  however, under sections 164 and 901(k)(7). In determining whether P's  passive income is high-taxed, the $100 dividend and the $30 deduction  are allocated to the first group of income described in paragraph  (c)(3)(iv) of this section (passive income subject to no withholding tax  or other foreign tax).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Financial services income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The principles of paragraph (e)(3) of this section  are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P is a domestic corporation that owns 100 percent of the  stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Country X.  For the 1990 taxable year, 60 percent of S's income is active financing  income that consists of income that will be considered general  limitation or passive income if S is not a financial services entity.  The other 40 percent of S's income is passive non-active financing  income. S is not a financial services entity and its active financing  income thus retains its character as general limitation and passive  income. S makes an interest payment to P in 1990 that is characterized  under the look-through rules. Although the interest is not financial  services income to S under the look-through rules, it retains its  character as active financing income when paid to P and P must take that  income into account in determining whether it is a financial services  entity under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. If P is determined to  be a financial services entity, both the portion of the interest payment  characterized as active financing income (whether general limitation or  passive income in S's hands) and the portion characterized as passive  non-active financing income received from S will be recharacterized as  financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation A, which is not a controlled foreign  corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation B,  which owns 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation C. A also  owns 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation D. D owns 100  percent of the stock of domestic corporation E, which owns 100 percent  of the stock of controlled foreign corporation F. All of the  corporations are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of  section 1504(a) (determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3)).  Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, however, only the  income of B, C, E, and F is counted in determining whether the group  meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For the  2001 taxable year, B's income consists of $95 of active financing income  and $5 of passive non-active financing income. C has $40 of active  financing income and $20 of passive non-active financing income. E has  $70 of active financing income and $15 of passive non-active financing  income. F has $10   of passive income. B and E qualify as financial services entities under  the entity test of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. Therefore, B and  E are financial services entities without regard to whether the group as  a whole is a financial services entity and all of the income of B and E  shall be treated as financial services income. C and F do not qualify as  financial services entities under the entity test of paragraph (e)(3)(i)  of this section. However, under the affiliated group test of paragraph  (e)(3)(ii) of this section, C and F are financial services entities  because at least 80 percent of the group's total income consists of  active financing income ($205 of active financing income is 80.4 percent  of $255 total income). B's and E's passive income is not treated as  active financing income for purposes of the affiliated group test of  paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section even though it is treated as  financial services income without regard to whether the group satisfies  the affiliated group test. Once C and F are determined to be financial  services entities under the affiliated group test, however, all of the  passive income of the group is treated as financial services income.  Thus, 100 percent of the income of B, C, E, and F for 2001 is financial  services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. PS is a domestic partnership operating in branch form in  foreign country X. PS has two equal general partners, A and B. A and B  are domestic corporations that each operate in branch form in foreign  countries Y and Z. All of A's income, except that derived through PS, is  manufacturing income. All of B's income, except that derived through PS,  is active financing income. A and B's only income from PS are  distributive shares of PS's income. PS is a financial services entity  and all of its income is financial services income. The income from PS  is excluded in determining if A or B are financial services entities.  Thus, A is not a financial services entity because none of A's income is  active financing income and B is a financial services entity because all  of B's income is active financing income. However, both A and B's  distributive shares of PS's taxable income consist of financial services  income even though A is not a financial services entity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. PS is a domestic partnership operating in foreign country  X. A and B are domestic corporations that are equal general partners in  PS and, therefore, the look-through rules apply for purposes of  characterizing A's and B's distributive shares of PS's income. Fifty  (50) percent of PS's gross income is active financing income that is not  high withholding tax interest. The active financing income includes  income that also meets the definition of passive income and income that  meets the definition of general limitation income. The other 50 percent  of PS's income is from manufacturing. PS is, therefore, not a financial  services entity. A s and B's distributive shares of partnership taxable  income consist of general limitation manufacturing income and active  financing income. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the active  financing income shall be financial services income to A or B if either  A or B is determined to be a financial services entity. If A or B is not  a financial services entity, the distributive shares of income from PS  will not be financial services income to A or B and will consist of  passive and general limitation income. All of the income from PS is  included in determining if A or B are financial services entities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. P is a United States corporation that is not a financial  services entity. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled  foreign corporation that is not a financial services entity. S owns 100  percent of the stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation that is a  financial services entity. In 1991, T pays a dividend to S. The dividend  from T is characterized under the look-through rules of section  904(d)(3). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the dividend  from T is excluded in determining whether S is a financial services  entity. S is determined not to be a financial services entity but the  dividend retains its character as financial services income in S's  hands. Any subpart F inclusion or dividend to P out of earnings and  profits attributable to the dividend from T will be excluded in  determining whether P is a financial services entity but the inclusion  or dividend will retain its character as financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definition of incidental income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rule.  Incidental income is income that is integrally related to active  financing income of a financial services entity. Such income includes,  for example, income from precious metals trading and commodity trading  that is integrally related to futures income. If securities, shares of  stock, or other types of property are acquired by a financial services  entity as an ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of an active  financing business, the income from such property will be considered to  be financial services income but only so long as the retention of such  property remains an ordinary or necessary incident to the conduct of  such business. Thus property, including stock, acquired as the result  of, or in order to prevent, a loss in an active financing business upon  a loan held by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of such business will  be considered ordinary and necessary to the conduct of such business,  but income from such property will be considered financial   services income only so long as the holding of such property remains an  ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of such business. If an  entity holds such property for five years or less then the property is  considered held incident to the financial services business. If an  entity holds such property for more than five years, a presumption will  be established that the entity is not holding such property incident to  its financial services business. An entity will be able to rebut the  presumption by demonstrating that under the facts and circumstances it  is not holding the property as an investment. However, the fact that an  entity holds the property for more than five years and is not able to  rebut the presumption that it is not holding the property incident to  its financial services business will not affect the characterization of  any income received from the property during the first five years as  financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a financial services entity within the meaning of  paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. In 1987, X made a loan in the  ordinary course of its business to an unrelated foreign corporation, Y.  As security for that loan, Y pledged certain operating assets. Those  assets generate income of a type that would be subject to the general  limitation. In January 1989, Y defaulted on the loan and forfeited the  collateral. During the period X held the assets, X earned operating  income generated by those assets. This income was applied in partial  satisfaction of Y's obligation. In 1993, X sold the forfeited assets.  The sales proceeds were in excess of the remainder of Y's obligation.  The operating income received in the period from 1989 to 1993 and the  income on the sale of the assets in 1993 are financial services income  of X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  instead of pledging its operating assets as collateral for the loan, Y  pledged the stock of its operating subsidiary Z. In 1993 X sold the  stock of Z in complete satisfaction of Y's obligation. X's income from  the sale of Z stock in satisfaction of Y's obligation is financial  services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a domestic corporation, is a financial services entity  within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. P holds a  United States dollar denominated debt (the ``obligation'') of the  Central Bank of foreign country X. The obligation evidences a loan of  $100 made by P to the Central Bank. In 1988, pursuant to a program of  country X, P delivers the obligation to the Central Bank which credits  70 units of country X currency to M, a country X corporation. M issues  all of its only class of capital stock to P. M invests the 70 units of  country X currency in the construction and operation of a new hotel in  X. In 1994, M distributes 10 units of country X currency to P as a  dividend. P is not able to rebut the presumption that it is not holding  the stock of M incident to its financial services business. The dividend  to P is, therefore, not financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section solely  because such income represents a relatively small proportion of the  taxpayer's total income or that the taxpayer engages in non-financial  activity on a sporadic basis. Thus, for example, income from data  processing services provided to related or unrelated parties or income  from the sale of goods or non-financial services (for example travel  services) is not financial services income, even if the recipient is a  financial services entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions.

Domestic corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of  domestic corporation P. S is not a financial services entity and has  accumulated cash reserves. P has uncollected trade and service  receivables of foreign obligors. P factors the receivables to S. The  income derived by S on the receivables is related person factoring  income. The income is also export financing interest. The income will be  passive income to S.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2except that instead  of factoring P's receivables, S finances the sales of P's goods by  making loans to the purchasers of P's goods. The interest derived by S  on these loans is export financing interest and is not related person  factoring income. The income will be general category income to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income eligible for section 864(d)(7) exception (same country  exception) from related person factoring treatment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income other  than interest. If any foreign person receives or accrues income that is  described in section 864(d)(7) (income on a trade or service receivable  acquired from a related person in the same foreign country as the  recipient) and such income would also meet the definition of export  financing interest if section 864(d)(1) applied to such income (income  on a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person treated  as interest), then the income shall be considered to be export financing  interest and shall be treated as general category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest income. If export financing interest is received or  accrued by any foreign person and that income would otherwise be treated  as related person factoring income under section 864(d)(6) if section  864(d)(7) did not apply, section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(I) shall apply, and  the interest shall be treated as general category income unless the  interest is received or accrued by a financial services entity. If that  interest is received or accrued by a financial services entity, section  904(d)(2)(C)(iii)(III) shall apply and the interest shall be treated  asgeneral category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of  this paragraph (h)(5):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of domestic corporation P. Controlled foreign corporation T  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of controlled foreign corporation S. S and  T are incorporated in Country M. In 1987, P sells tractors to T, which T  sells to X, an unrelated foreign corporation organized in country M. The  tractors are to be used in country M. T uses a substantial part of its  assets in its trade or business located in Country M. T has uncollected  trade receivables from X that it factors to S. S derived more than 20  percent of its gross income for 1987 other than from an active financing  business and the income derived by S from the receivables is not derived  in an active financing business. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i)  of this section, S is not a financial services entity. The income is not  related person factoring income because it is described in section  864(d)(7) (income eligible for the same country exception). If section  864(d)(1) applied, the income S derived from the receivables would meet  the definition of export financing interest. The income, therefore, is  considered to be export financing interest and is general category  income to S.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of domestic corporation, P. Controlled foreign corporation T  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of controlled foreign corporation S. S and  T are incorporated in country M. S is not a financial services entity.  In 1987, P sells tractors to T, which T sells to X, a foreign  partnership that is organized in country M and is related to S and T. S  makes a loan to X to finance the tractor sales. The interest earned by S  from financing the sales is described in section 864(d)(7) and is export  financing interest. Therefore, the income shall be general category  income to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interaction of section 907(c) and income described in this  section. If a person receives or accrues income that is income described  in section 907(c) (relating to oil and gas income), the rules of section  907(c) and the regulations thereunder, as well as the rules of this  section, shall apply to the income. The reduction in amount allowed as  foreign tax provided by section 907(a) shall therefore be calculated  separately for income in each separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Special rule for DASTM gain or loss. Any DASTM gain or loss  computed under Sec. 1.985-3(d) must be allocated among the categories  of income under the rules of Sec. 1.985-3 (e)(2)(iv) or (e)(3). The  rules of Sec. 1.985-3(e) apply before the rules of section  904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) (the exception from passive income for high-taxed  income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Special rule for alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit. For  purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit  under section 59(a), items included in alternative minimum taxable  income by reason of section 56(g) (adjustments based on adjusted current  earnings) shall be characterized as income described in a separate  category under section 904(d) and this section based on the character of  the underlying items of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Priority rule. Income that meets the definitions of a separate  category described in paragraph (m) of this section and another category  of income described in section 904(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) will be subject  to the separate limitation described in paragraph (m) of this section  and will not be treated as general category income described in section  904(d)(2)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Income treated as allocable to an additional separate category.  If section 904(a), (b), and (c) are applied separately to any category  of income under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section  56(g)(4)(C)(iii)(IV), 245(a)(10), 865(h), 901(j), or 904(h)(10)), that  category of income will be treated for all purposes of the Internal  Revenue Code and regulations as if it were a separate category listed in  section 904(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Effective/applicability dates. Paragraphs (a), (b), (h)(3), and  (l) of this section shall apply to taxable years of United States  persons and, for purposes of section 906, foreign persons beginning  after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007, and to  taxable years of a foreign corporation which end with or within taxable  years of its domestic corporate shareholder beginning after December 31,  2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007. For purposes of  determining whether passive income is high-taxed income, the grouping  rules of paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section apply in taxable  years ending on or after April 20, 2009. See 26 CFR Sec. 1.904-4T(c)(3)  and (4) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for grouping   rules applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, and  ending before April 20, 2009. For corresponding rules applicable to  taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, see 26 CFR Sec. 1.904- 4(c)(2)(i) (revised as of April 1, 2006).
