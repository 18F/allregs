Proper usage of all test instrumentation is essential to obtain valid measurements. Operating manuals or other literature furnished by the instrument manufacturer must be referred to for both recommended operation of the instrument and

precautions to be observed. The following instrumentation must be used, where applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sound level measurement system which meets the type S1A requirements of American National Standard Specification for Sound Level Meters, ANSI S1.4-1971. As an alternative to making direct measurements using a sound level meter, a microphone or sound level meter may be used with a magnetic tape recorder and/or a graphic level recorder or indicating instrument provided that the system meets the performance requirements of ANSI S1.4-1971. The sound level measurement system must be calibrated at least annually to insure that the system meets the performance requirements of ANSI S1.4-1971.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An acoustic calibrator with an accuracy of within 0.5 dB.
