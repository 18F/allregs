                                Sec. 650.1  Nature and purpose of the standard.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This standard is responsive to the overriding concern of the  U.S. Supreme Court in California Department of Human Resources v. Java,  402 U.S. 121 (1971), and that of other courts with delay in payment of  unemployment compensation to eligible individuals, including delays  caused specifically by the adjudication process. The standard seeks to  assure that all administrative appeals affecting benefit rights are  heard and decided with the greatest promptness that is administratively  feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sections 303(a) (1) and (3) of the Social Security Act require,  as a condition for the receipt of granted funds, that State laws include  provisions for methods of administration reasonably calculated to insure  full payment of unemployment compensation when due, and opportunity for  a fair hearing for all individuals whose claims for unemployment  compensation are denied. The Secretary has construed these provisions to  require, as a condition for receipt of granted funds, that State laws  include provisions for hearing and deciding appeals for all unemployment  insurance claimants who are parties to an administrative benefit appeal  with the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible. What is  the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible in an  individual case depends on the facts and circumstances of that case. For  example, the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible will  be longer in cases that involve interstate appeals, complex issues of  fact or law, reasonable requests by parties for continuances or  rescheduling of hearings or other unforeseen and uncontrollable factors  than it will be for other cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition, the Secretary has construed section 303(b)(2) of  the Social Security Act as requiring States to comply substantially with  the required provisions of State law. The Secretary considers as  substantial compliance the issuance of minimum percentages of first  level benefit appeal decisions within the periods of time specified in  Sec. 650.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Although the interpretation of Federal law requirements in Sec.  650.3 below applies to both first and second level administrative  benefit appeals, the criteria for review of State compliance in Sec.  650.3(b) apply only to first level benefit appeals.</p>
