When opening the Federal Supply Schedules for products and services determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, for use by eligible non-federal entities, the contracting officer must make minor modifications to certain Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and GSAM provisions and clauses in order to make clear distinctions between the rights and responsibilities of the U.S. Government in its management and regulatory capacity pursuant to which it awards schedule contracts and fulfills associated Federal requirements versus the rights and responsibilities of eligible ordering activities placing orders to fulfill agency needs. Accordingly, the contracting officer is authorized to modify the following FAR provisions/clauses to delete ``Government'' or similar language referring to the U.S. Government and substitute ``ordering activity'' or similar language when preparing solicitations and contracts to be awarded under the Federal Supply Schedules for products and services determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
