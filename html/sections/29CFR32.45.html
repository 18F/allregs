                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Periodic compliance reviews. The Assistant Secretary shall from time-to-time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adoption of grievance procedures. A recipient shall adopt an internal review procedure incorporating appropriate due process standards which provides for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by this part. The complainant or his or her representative shall file the complaint with the recipient for processing under those procedures. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown. The recipient shall maintain records on all complaints filed alleging violation of the Act and shall make such records available to the Assistant Secretary upon request. The complaint and all actions take thereunder shall be kept confidential by the recipient. If the complaint has not been resolved under those procedures satisfactorily to the complainant within 60 days of the filing or referral, the complainant or his or her representative may file a complaint with the Assistant Secretary within 30 days of the recipient level decision or 90 days from the date of filing the complaint, whichever is earlier. Upon such filing, the Assistant Secretary will proceed as provided in this section. Exhaustion of recipient level procedures shall be required except where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient has not acted within the timeframe specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The recipient's procedures are not in compliance with this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An emergency situation is determined to exist by the Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complaints. Where recipient level procedures have been exhausted, any person who believes he or she or any specific class of individuals has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may (or through an authorized representative) file a written complaint with the Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of complaints. Complaints must be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and address (including telephone or TTY number) of the complainant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name and address of the recipient or sub-grantee who committed the alleged violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the act or acts considered to be a violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the individual is handicapped or has a history of a handicap or other documentation of impairment or was regard by the recipient as having an impairment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other pertinent information available which will assist in the investigation and resolution of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Incomplete information. Where a complaint contains incomplete information, the Assistant Secretary shall seek the needed information or any other information which indicates a possible failure to comply with this part from the complainant and shall be responsible for developing a complete record. If such information is not provided within 60 days, the complaint may be closed upon notice to the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Resolution of matters. Where an investigation indicates that the recipient has not complied with the requirements of the Act or this part, efforts shall be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion within a reasonable time. Before the recipient or subgrantee can be found to be in compliance, it must make a specific commitment, in writing, to take corrective action to meet the requirements of the Act and this part. The commitment must indicate the precise action to be taken and dates for completion. The time period allowed should be no longer than the minimum period necessary to effect such changes. Upon approval of such commitment by the Assistant Secretary, the recipient may be considered in compliance on condition that the commitments are kept. Where the investigation indicates a violation of the Act or regulations in this part (and the matter has not been resolved by informal means), the Assistant Secretary shall afford the recipient an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Sec. 32.47.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. The sanctions and penalties contained in this regulation may be exercised by the Assistant Secretary against any recipient or sub-grantee who fails to take all necessary steps to ensure that no person intimidates, threatens, coerces or discriminates against any individual for the purpose of interfering with the filing of a complaint, furnishing information, or assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the Act.</p>
