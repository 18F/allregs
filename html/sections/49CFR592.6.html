                            <p class="depth0">Each Registered Importer must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports into the  United States, assure that the Administrator has decided that the  vehicle is eligible for importation pursuant to Part 593 of this chapter  prior to such importation. The Registered Importer must also bring such  vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  standards prescribed under Part 571 of this chapter and the bumper  standard prescribed under Part 581 of this chapter, if applicable, and  furnish certification to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e) of  this section, within 120 calendar days after such entry. For each motor  vehicle, the Registered Importer must furnish to the Secretary of  Homeland Security at the time of importation a bond in an amount equal  to 150 percent of the dutiable value of the vehicle, as determined by  the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that such vehicle either  will be brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor  vehicle safety and bumper standards or will be exported (at no cost to  the United States) by the importer or the Secretary of Homeland Security  or abandoned to the United States. However, if the Registered Importer  has procured a continuous entry bond, it must furnish the Administrator  with such bond, and must furnish the Secretary of Homeland Security  (acting on behalf of the Administrator) with a paper or electronic copy,  in a format accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, of such bond  at the time of importation of each motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establish, maintain, and retain, for 10 years from the date of  entry, at the facility in the United States it has identified in its  application pursuant to Sec. 592.5 (a)(5)(i), for each motor vehicle  for which it furnishes a certificate of conformity, the following  records, including correspondence and other documents, in hard copy  format:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The declaration required by Sec. 591.5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All vehicle or equipment purchase or sales orders or agreements,  conformance agreements between the Registered Importer and persons who  import motor vehicles for personal use, and correspondence between the  Registered Importer and the owner or purchaser of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The make, model, model year, odometer reading, and VIN of each  vehicle that it imports and the last known name and address of the owner  or purchaser of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records, including photographs and other documents, sufficient  to identify the vehicle and to substantiate that it has been brought  into conformity with all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper  standards that apply to the vehicle, that the certification label has  been affixed, and that either the vehicle is not subject to any safety  recalls or that all noncompliances and safety defects covered by such  recalls were remedied before the submission to the Administrator under  paragraph (d) of this section. All photographs submitted shall be  unaltered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the certification submitted to the Administrator  pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The number that the issuer has assigned to the service insurance  policy that will accompany the vehicle and the full corporate or other  business name of the issuer of the policy, and substantiation that the  Registered Importer has notified the issuer of the policy that the  policy has been provided with the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Take possession of the vehicle and perform all modifications  necessary to conform the vehicle to all Federal motor vehicle safety and  bumper standards that apply to the vehicle at a facility that it has  identified to the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 592.5(a)(5)(i), and  permanently affix to the vehicle at that facility, upon completion of  conformance modifications and remedy of all noncompliances and defects  that are the subject of any pending safety recalls, a label that  identifies the Registered Importer and states that the Registered  Importer certifies that the vehicle complies with all Federal motor  vehicle safety and   bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, and contains all additional  information required by Sec. 567.4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each motor vehicle imported pursuant to part 591.5(f) of  this chapter, certify to the Administrator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 120 days of the importation that it has brought the motor  vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  and bumper standards in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured  by the fabricating manufacturer. Such certification shall state verbatim  either that ``I know that the vehicle that I am certifying conforms with  all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards because  I personally witnessed each modification performed on the vehicle to  effect compliance,'' or that ``I know that the vehicle I am certifying  conforms with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper  standards because the person who performed the necessary modifications  to the vehicle is an employee of [RI name] and has provided full  documentation of the work that I have reviewed, and I am satisfied that  the vehicle as modified complies.'' The Registered Importer shall also  certify that it has destroyed or exported any noncompliant motor vehicle  equipment items that were removed from an imported vehicle in the course  of performing conformance modifications. The Registered Importer shall  also certify, as appropriate, that either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The vehicle is not required to comply with the parts marking  requirements of the theft prevention standard (part 541 of this  chapter); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The vehicle complies with those parts marking requirements as  manufactured, or as modified prior to importation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Registered Importer certifies that the vehicle was  originally manufactured to comply with a standard that does not apply to  the vehicle or that it has modified the vehicle to conform to such  standard, or if the certification is incomplete, the Administrator may  refuse to accept the certification. The Administrator shall refuse to  accept a certification for a vehicle that has not been determined to be  eligible for importation under part 593 of this chapter. If the  Administrator does not accept a submission, (s)he shall return it to the  Registered Importer. The costs associated with such a return will be  charged to the Registered Importer. If the Administrator returns the  submission as described above and the vehicle is eligible for  importation, the 120-day period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section continues to run, but the 30-day period specified in paragraph  (f) of this section does not begin to run until the Administrator has  accepted the submission. If the vehicle is not eligible for importation,  the importer must export it from, or abandon it to, the United States.  If the Registered Importer certifies that it has modified the vehicle to  bring it into compliance with a standard and has, in fact, not performed  all required modifications, the Administrator will regard such  certification as ``knowingly false'' within the meaning of 49 U.S.C.  30115 and 49 U.S.C. 30141(c)(4)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The certification must be signed and submitted by a principal of  the Registered Importer designated in its registration application  pursuant to Sec. 592.5(a)(5)(iv), with an original hand-written  signature and not with a signature that is stamped or mechanically  applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The certification to the Administrator must specify the location  of the facility where the vehicle was conformed, and the location where  the Administrator may inspect the motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The certification to the Administrator must state and contain  substantiation either that the vehicle is not subject to any safety  recalls as of the time of such certification, or, alternatively, that  all noncompliances and defects that are the subject of those safety  recalls have been remedied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When a Registered Importer certifies a make, model, and model  year of a motor vehicle for the first time, its certification must  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The make, model, model year and date of manufacture, odometer  reading, VIN that complies with Sec. 565.4(b), (c), and (g) of this  chapter, and Customs Entry Number,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that it has brought the vehicle into conformity  with all Federal motor vehicle safety and   bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, and a description, with  respect to each standard for which modifications were needed, of the  modifications performed,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the bond given at the time of entry to ensure  conformance with the safety and bumper standards,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The vehicle's vehicle eligibility number, as stated in appendix  A to part 593 of this chapter,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A copy of the HS-7 Declaration form executed at the time of its  importation if a Customs broker did not make an electronic entry for the  vehicle with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Unaltered front, side, and rear photographs of the vehicle,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Unaltered photographs of the original manufacturer's  certification label and the certification label of the Registered  Importer affixed to the vehicle (and, if the vehicle is a motorcycle, a  photograph or photocopy of the Registered Importer certification label  before it has been affixed),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Unaltered photographs and documentation sufficient to  demonstrate conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  and bumper standards to which the vehicle was not originally  manufactured to conform,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The policy number of the service insurance policy furnished  with the vehicle pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, and the full  corporate or other business name of the insurer that issued the policy,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A statement that the submission is the Registered Importer's  initial certification submission for the make, model, and model year of  the vehicle covered by the certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Except as specified in this paragraph, a Registered Importer's  second and subsequent certification submissions for a given make, model,  and model year vehicle must contain the information required by  paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If the Registered Importer conformed  such a vehicle in the same manner as it stated in its initial  certification submission, it may say so in a subsequent submission and  it need not provide the description required by paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports, not take any  of the following actions until the bond referred to in paragraph (a) of  this section has been released, unless 30 days have elapsed from the  date the Administrator receives the Registered Importer's certification  of compliance of the motor vehicle in accordance with paragraph (d) of  this section (the 30-day period will be extended if the Administrator  has made written demand to inspect the motor vehicle):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operate the motor vehicle on the public streets, roads, and  highways for any purpose other than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transportation to and from a franchised dealership of the  vehicle's original manufacturer for remedying a noncompliance or safety- related defect; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mileage accumulation to stabilize the vehicle's catalyst and  emissions control systems in preparation for pre-certification testing  to obtain an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certificate of  conformity, but only insofar as the vehicle has been imported by an  Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) who holds a current certificate of  conformity with the EPA, the ICI has imported the vehicle under an EPA  Declaration form 3520-1 on which Code J is checked, and the EPA has  granted the ICI written permission to operate the vehicle on public  roads for that purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sell the motor vehicle or offer it for sale;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Store the motor vehicle on the premises of a motor vehicle  dealer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Title the motor vehicle in a name other than its own, or license  or register it for use on public streets, roads, or highways; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Release custody of the motor vehicle to a person for sale, or  for license or registration for use on public streets, roads, and  highways, or for titling in a name other than that of the Registered  Importer who imported the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Furnish with each motor vehicle for which it furnishes  certification or information to the Administrator in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section, not later than the time it sells the  vehicle, or releases custody of a vehicle to an owner who has imported  it for personal use, a service insurance   policy written or underwritten by an independent insurance company, in  the amount of $2,000. The Registered Importer shall provide the  insurance company with a monthly list of the VINs of vehicles covered by  the policies of the insurance company, and shall retain a copy of each  such list in its files.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Comply with the requirements of part 580 of this chapter,  Odometer Disclosure Requirements, when the Registered Importer is a  transferor of a vehicle as defined by Sec. 580.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> With respect to any motor vehicle it has imported and for which  it has furnished a performance bond, deliver such vehicle to the  Secretary of Homeland Security for export, or abandon it to the United  States, upon demand by the Administrator, if such vehicle has not been  brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  and bumper standards within 120 days from entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to any motor vehicle that it has imported or for  which it has furnished a certificate of conformity or information to the  Administrator as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, provide  notification in accordance with part 577 of this chapter and a remedy  without charge to the vehicle owner, after any notification under part  573 of this chapter that a vehicle to which such motor vehicle is  substantially similar contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety  or fails to conform with an applicable Federal motor vehicle safety  standard. However, this obligation does not exist if the manufacturer of  the vehicle or the Registered Importer of such vehicle demonstrates to  the Administrator that the defect or noncompliance is not present in  such vehicle, or that the defect or noncompliance was remedied before  the submission of the certificate or the information to the  Administrator, or that the original manufacturer of the vehicle will  provide such notification and remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Registered Importer becomes aware (from whatever source)  that the manufacturer of a vehicle it has imported will not provide a  remedy without charge for a defect or noncompliance that has been  determined to exist in that vehicle, within 30 days thereafter, the  Registered Importer must inform NHTSA and submit a copy of the  notification letter that it intends to send to owners of the vehicle(s)  in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any notification to vehicle owners sent by a Registered Importer  must contain the information specified in Sec. 577.5 of this chapter,  and must include the statement that if the Registered Importer's repair  facility is more than 50 miles from the owner's mailing address,  remedial repairs may be performed at no charge at a specific facility  designated by the Registered Importer that is within 50 miles of the  owner's mailing address, or, if no such facility is designated, that  repairs may be performed anywhere, with the cost of parts and labor to  be reimbursed by the Registered Importer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Defect and noncompliance notifications by a Registered Importer  must conform to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 577.7 and 577.8 of this  chapter, and are subject to Sec. Sec. 577.9 and 577.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in this paragraph, instead of the six  quarterly reports required by Sec. 573.7(a) of this chapter, the  Registered Importer must submit to the Administrator two reports  containing the information specified in Sec. 573.7(b)(1) through (4) of  this chapter. The reports shall cover the periods ending nine and 18  months after the commencement of the owner notification campaign, and  must be submitted within 30 days of the end of each period. However, the  reporting requirements established by this paragraph shall not apply to  any safety recall that a vehicle manufacturer conducts that includes  vehicles for which the Registered Importer has submitted the information  required by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The requirement that the remedy be provided without charge does  not apply if the motor vehicle was bought by its first purchaser from  the Registered Importer (or, if imported for personal use, conformed  pursuant to a contract with the Registered Importer) more than 10  calendar years before the date the Registered Importer or the original  manufacturer notifies the Administrator of the noncompliance or safety- related defect pursuant to part 573 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In order that the Administrator may determine whether the  Registered Importer is meeting its statutory responsibilities, allow  representatives of NHTSA during operating hours, upon demand, and upon  presentation of credentials, to copy documents, or to inspect, monitor,  or photograph any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any facility identified by the Registered Importer where any  vehicle for which a Registered Importer has the responsibility of  providing a certificate of conformity to the Administrator is being  modified, repaired, tested, or stored, and any facility where any record  or other document relating to the modification, repair, testing, or  storage of these vehicles is kept;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any part or aspect of activities relating to the modification,  repair, testing, or storage of vehicles by the Registered Importer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any motor vehicle for which the Registered Importer has provided  a certification of conformity to the Administrator before the  Administrator releases the conformance bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Provide an annual statement, certifying that the information  therein is true and correct, and pay an annual fee as required by Sec.  592.5(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Except as noted in this paragraph, notify the Administrator in  writing of any change that occurs in the information which was submitted  in its registration application, not later than the 30th calendar day  after such change. If a Registered Importer intends to use a facility  that was not identified in its registration application, not later than  30 days before it begins to use such facility, it must notify the  Administrator of its intent to use such facility and provide a  description of the intended use, a copy of the lease or deed evidencing  the Registered Importer's ownership or tenancy of the facility, and a  copy of the license or similar document issued by an appropriate state  or municipal authority stating that the Registered Importer is licensed  to do business at that facility as an importer and/or modifier and/or  seller of motor vehicles (or a statement that it has made a bona fide  inquiry and is not required by state or local law to have such a license  or permission), and a sufficient number of unaltered photographs of that  facility to fully depict the Registered Importer's intended use. If a  Registered Importer intends to change its street address or telephone  number or discontinue use of a facility that was identified in its  registration application, it shall notify the Administrator not less  than 10 days before such change or discontinuance of such use, and  identify the facility, if any, that will be used instead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Assure that at least one full-time employee of the Registered  Importer is present at at least one of the Registered Importer's  facilities in the United States during normal business hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Not co-utilize the same employee, or any repair or conformance  facility, with any other Registered Importer. If a Registered Importer  co-utilizes the same storage facility with another Registered Importer  or another entity, the storage area of each Registered Importer must be  clearly delineated, and the vehicles being stored by each Registered  Importer may not be mingled with vehicles for which that Registered  Importer is not responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Make timely, complete, and accurate responses to any requests by  the Administrator for information, whether by general or special order  or otherwise, to enable the Administrator to decide whether the  Registered Importer has complied or is complying with 49 U.S.C. Chapters  301 and 325, and the regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Pay all fees either by certified check, cashier's check, money  order, credit card, or Electronic Funds Transfer System made payable to  the Treasurer of the United States, in accordance with the invoice of  fees incurred by the Registered Importer in the previous month that is  provided by the Administrator. All such fees are due and payable not  later than 15 days from the date of the invoice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Not later than November 1, 2004, file with the Administrator all  information required by Sec. 592.5(a), as amended. If a Registered  Importer has previously provided any item of information to the  Administrator in its registration application, annual statement, or  notification of change, it may incorporate that item by reference in   the filing required under this subsection, provided that it clearly  indicates the date, page, and entry of the previously-provided document.
