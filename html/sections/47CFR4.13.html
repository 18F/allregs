                            <p class="depth0">Reports by the National Communications System (NCS) and by special offices and facilities (other than 911 special offices and facilities) of outages potentially affecting them (see paragraphs (a) through (d) of Sec. 4.5) shall be made according to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When there is a mission-affecting outage, the affected facility will report the outage to the NCS and call the communications provider in order to determine if the outage is expected to last 30 minutes. If the outage is not expected to, and does not, last 30 minutes, it will not be reported to the

Commission. If it is expected to last 30 minutes or does last 30 minutes, the NCS, on the advice of the affected special facility and in the exercise of its judgment, will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Forward a report of the outage to the Commission, supplying the information for initial reports affecting special facilities specified in this section of the Commission's Rules;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forward a report of the outage to the Commission, designating the outage as one affecting ``special facilities,'' but reporting it at a level of detail that precludes identification of the particular facility involved; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hold the report at the NCS due to the critical nature of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If there is to be a report to the Commission, an electronic, written, or oral report will be given by the NCS within 120 minutes of an outage to the Commission's Duty Officer, on duty 24 hours a day in the FCC's Communications and Crisis Management Center in Washington, DC. Notification may be served at such other facility designated by the Commission by public notice or (at the time of the emergency) by public announcement only if there is a telephone outage or similar emergency in Washington, DC. If the report is oral, it is to be followed by an electronic or written report not later than the next business day. Those providers whose service failures are in any way responsible for the outage must consult and cooperate in good faith with NCS upon its request for information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additionally, if there is to be a report to the Commission, the communications provider will provide a written report to the NCS, supplying the information for final reports for special facilities required by this section of the Commission's rules. The communications provider's final report to the NCS will be filed within 28 days after the outage, allowing the NCS to then file the report with the Commission within 30 days after the outage. If the outage is reportable as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the NCS determines that the final report can be presented to the Commission without jeopardizing matters of national security or emergency preparedness, the NCS will forward the report as provided in either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section to the Commission.</p>
