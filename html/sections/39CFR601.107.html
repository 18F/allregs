                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Days. Calendar days; however, any time period  will run until a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disagreements. All disputes, protests, claims, disagreements, or  demands of whatsoever nature arising in connection with the acquisition  of property and services within the scope of Sec. 601.103 of this  chapter, except those:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That arise pursuant to a contract under the Contract Disputes  Act under Sec. 601.109;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That concern debarment, suspension, or ineligibility under  Sec. 601.113; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That arise out of the nonrenewal of transportation contracts  containing other provisions for the review of such decisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interested parties. Actual or prospective offerors whose direct  economic interests would be affected by the award of, or failure to  award, the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lodge. A disagreement is lodged on the date it is received by  the contracting officer or the Supplier Disagreement Resolution  Official, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> SDR Official. The Supplier Disagreement Resolution Official, a  contracting officer designated by the Postal Service to perform the  functions established under Sec. 601.108.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. It is the policy of the Postal Service and in the  interest of its suppliers to resolve disagreements by mutual agreement  between the supplier and the responsible contracting officer. All  disagreements must be lodged with the responsible contracting office in  writing via facsimile, e-mail, hand delivery, or U.S. Mail. For  disagreements that concern the award of a contract, the disagreement  shall be lodged within 10 days of the date the supplier received  notification of award or 10 days from the date the supplier received a  debriefing, whichever is later. For disagreements that concern alleged  improprieties in a solicitation, the contracting officer must receive  the disagreement before the time set for the receipt of proposals,  unless the disagreement concerns an alleged impropriety that does not  exist in the initial solicitation but which is subsequently incorporated  into the solicitation, in which event the contracting officer must  receive the disagreement no later than the next closing time for the  receipt of proposals following the incorporation. The resolution period  shall last 10 days from the date when the disagreement is lodged with  the contracting officer. During the supplier-contracting officer 10-day  resolution period, the responsible contracting officer's management may  help to resolve the disagreement. At the conclusion of the 10-day  resolution period, the contracting officer must communicate, in writing,  to the supplier his or her resolution of the disagreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution  (ADR) procedures may be used to resolve a disagreement. If the use of  ADR is agreed upon, the 10-day limitation is suspended. If agreement  cannot be   reached, the supplier has 10 days to lodge its disagreement with the SDR  Official.  [75 FR 1542, Jan. 12, 2010]</p>
