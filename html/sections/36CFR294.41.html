The sole purpose of the linear  disturbance is to accommodate equipment needed to construct and  transport supplies and personnel needed to install or maintain the  linear facility. It is not a road, not used as a motor vehicle route,  not open for public use, and is not engineered to road specifications.</p><p class="depth0">Linear Facility: Linear facilities include pipelines, electrical  power lines, telecommunications lines, ditches, canals, and dams.</p><p class="depth0">Municipal Water Supply System: As defined under Section 101 of the  HFRA, and used in this subpart, the term means the reservoirs, canals,  ditches, flumes, laterals, pipes, pipelines, and other surface  facilities and systems constructed or installed for the collection,  impoundment, storage, transportation, or distribution of drinking water.</p><p class="depth0">Native Cutthroat Trout: Collectively, all the native subspecies of  cutthroat trout historically occurring in Colorado before European  settlement which includes yellowfin, Rio Grande, Greenback, and Colorado  River Trout.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent Road: Roads that are either a forest road; private road (a  road under private ownership authorized by an easement granted to a  private party or a road that provides access pursuant to a reserved or  outstanding right); or public road (a road under the jurisdiction of and  maintained by a public road authority and open to public travel).</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Existing Water Court Decree: An adjudicated conditional or  absolute decree issued by a Colorado Court, the initial application for  which was filed prior to July 3, 2012, adjudicating as the point of a  diversion or the place of use a location within a Colorado Roadless  Area.

Water conveyance structures include, but  are not limited to: Reservoirs and dams, diversion structures,  headgates, pipelines, ditches, canals, and tunnels.</p><p class="depth2">Water Influence Zone: The land next to water bodies where vegetation  plays a major role in sustaining long-term integrity of aquatic systems.  It includes the geomorphic floodplain (valley bottom), riparian  ecosystem, and inner gorge. Its minimum horizontal width (from top of  each bank) is 100 feet or the mean height of mature dominant late-seral  vegetation, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2">Watershed Conservation Practice: The watershed conservation  practices are stewardship actions based upon scientific principles and  legal requirements to protect soil, aquatic and riparian resources. Each  watershed conservation practice consists of a management measure, a set  of design criteria used to achieve the management measure, and guidance  for monitoring and restoration.
