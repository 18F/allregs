                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You must determine the useful life of your BIG-funded project using  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (3) of this section,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step 1. Identify all capital improvements that are proposed in  your project. We may reject your application if you do not include an  estimate for useful life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use the definition of capital improvement at Sec.  86.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The capital improvement must be a structure or system that  serves an identified purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consider the function of the components in your application  and group those with a similar purpose together as structures or  systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All auxiliary components of your project (those that are not  directly part of the structure or system) must be identified as  necessary for the continued use of an identified capital improvement.  For example, a gangway is not part of the dock system, but is necessary  for access to and from the dock system, so it could be included in the  useful life of the dock system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Attach an auxiliary component as identified at paragraph  (a)(1)(iv) of this section to only one capital improvement. If it  supports more than one, choose the one with the longest useful life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples of structures or systems that could potentially make  up a single capital improvement are a: Rest room/shower building; dock  system; breakwater; seawall; basin, as altered by dredging; or fuel  station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2. Estimate the useful life of each capital improvement  identified in Step 1 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State how you determine the useful life estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify factors that may influence the useful life of the  identified capital improvement, such as: Marine environment, wave  action, weather conditions, and heavy usage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples of sources to obtain estimates for useful life  information when developing your application are: Vendors, engineers,  contractors, or others with expertise or experience with a capital  improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 3. If you are asking us to consider additional points for a  physical component, technology, or technique under the criterion at  Sec.  86.51(c) that will increase the useful life, you must describe in  your application:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The capital improvement or component that you will apply the  criterion at Sec.  86.51(c) to;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The expected increase in useful life;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The sources of information that support your determination of  an extended useful life; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of how you expect the useful life will be  increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> After you submit your application, but before we award your  grant, you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirm the useful life for each capital improvement using a  generally accepted method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide any additional documents or information, if we request  it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consult and obtain agreement for your final useful life  determinations at the State or Regional level, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revise your application, as needed, to include the final useful  life determination(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>,  we will reduce your score and adjust the ranking of applications  accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> You must finalize useful life in your grant by one of the  following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State several useful-life expectations, one for each individual  capital improvement you identified at paragraph (a)(1) of this section;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State a single useful life for the whole project, based on the  longest useful life of the capital improvements you identified at  paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> States may decide to use only one of the methods described at  paragraph (d) of this section for all BIG-funded projects in their  State.</p>
