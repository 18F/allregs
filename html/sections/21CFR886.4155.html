                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A scleral plug is a prescription device intended to provide temporary closure of a scleral incision during an ophthalmic surgical procedure. These plugs prevent intraocular fluid and pressure loss when instruments are withdrawn from the eye. Scleral plugs include a head portion remaining above the sclera, which can be gripped for insertion and removal, and a shaft that fits inside the scleral incision. Scleral plugs are removed before completing the surgery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special controls for the scleral plug are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in Sec. 886.9 if the material is a surgical grade stainless steel with or without a gold, silver, or titanium coating. The special controls for the surgical grade stainless steel scleral plug (with or without a gold, silver, or titanium coating) are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The device must be demonstrated to be sterile during the labeled shelf life;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Labeling must include all information required for the safe and effective use of the device, including specific instructions regarding the proper sizing, placement, and removal of the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The device is not exempt from premarket notification procedures if it is composed of a material other than surgical grade stainless steel (with or without a gold, silver, or titanium coating). The special controls for scleral plugs made of other materials are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The device must be demonstrated to be sterile during the labeled shelf life;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Characterization of the device materials must be performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Performance data must demonstrate acceptable mechanical properties under simulated clinical use conditions including insertion and removal of the device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Performance data must demonstrate adequately low levels of the extractables or residues from manufacturing (or processing) of the device; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Labeling must include all information required for the safe and effective use of the device, including specific instructions regarding the proper sizing, placement, and removal of the device.
