These facilities are located adjacent to navigable water.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Lack of Adequate Secondary Containment at Facilities With a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons. Any facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 million gallons without secondary containment sufficiently large to contain the capacity of the largest aboveground oil storage tank within each area plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation must submit a response plan to EPA. Secondary containment structures that meet the standard of good engineering practice for the purposes of this part include berms, dikes, retaining walls, curbing, culverts, gutters, or other drainage systems.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Proximity to Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments at Facilities With a Total Oil Storage Capacity Greater Than or Equal to 1 Million Gallons. A facility with a total oil storage capacity greater than or equal to 1 million gallons must submit its response plan if it is located at a distance such that a discharge from the facility could cause injury (as defined at 40 CFR 112.2) to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.

________________________________________________________________________Date</p><p class="depth0">Attachment C-III--Calculation of the Planning Distance</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Introduction</p><p class="depth0">1.1 The facility owner or operator must evaluate whether the facility is located at a distance such that a discharge from the facility could cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments or disrupt operations at a public drinking water intake. To quantify that distance, EPA considered oil transport mechanisms over land and on still, tidal influence, and moving navigable waters. EPA has determined that the primary concern for calculation of a planning distance is the transport of oil in navigable waters during adverse weather conditions. Therefore, two formulas have been developed to determine distances for planning purposes from the point of discharge at the facility to the potential site of impact on moving and still waters, respectively. The formula for oil transport on moving navigable water is based on the velocity of the water body and the time interval for arrival of response resources. The still water formula accounts for the spread of discharged oil over the surface of the water. The method to determine oil transport on tidal influence areas is based on the type of oil discharged and the distance down current during ebb tide and up current during flood tide to the point of maximum tidal influence.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 EPA's formulas were designed to be simple to use. However, facility owners or operators may calculate planning distances using more sophisticated formulas, which take into account broader scientific or engineering principles, or local conditions. Such comparable formulas may result in different planning distances than EPA's formulas. In the event that an alternative formula that is comparable to one contained in this appendix is used to evaluate the criterion in 40 CFR 112.20(f)(1)(ii)(B) or (f)(1)(ii)(C), the owner or operator shall attach documentation to the response plan cover sheet contained in appendix F to this part that demonstrates the reliability and analytical soundness of the alternative formula and shall notify the Regional Administrator in

writing that an alternative formula was used. \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For persistent oils or non-persistent oils, a worst case trajectory model (i.e., an alternative formula) may be substituted for the distance formulas described in still, moving, and tidal waters, subject to Regional Administrator's review of the model. An example of an alternative formula that is comparable to the one contained in this appendix would be a worst case trajectory calculation based on credible adverse winds, currents, and/or river stages, over a range of seasons, weather conditions, and river stages. Based on historical information or a spill trajectory model, the Agency may require that additional fish and wildlife and sensitive environments or public drinking water intakes also be protected.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1.3 A regulated facility may meet the criteria for the potential to cause substantial harm to the environment without having to perform a planning distance calculation. For facilities that meet the substantial harm criteria because of inadequate secondary containment or oil spill history, as listed in the flowchart in Attachment C-I to this appendix, calculation of the planning distance is unnecessary. For facilities that do not meet the substantial harm criteria for secondary containment or oil spill history as listed in the flowchart, calculation of a planning distance for proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments and public drinking water intakes is required, unless it is clear without performing the calculation (e.g., the facility is located in a wetland) that these areas would be impacted.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 A facility owner or operator who must perform a planning distance calculation on navigable water is only required to do so for the type of navigable water conditions (i.e., moving water, still water, or tidal- influenced water) applicable to the facility. If a facility owner or operator determines that more than one type of navigable water condition applies, then the facility owner or operator is required to perform a planning distance calculation for each navigable water type to determine the greatest single distance that oil may be transported. As a result, the final planning distance for oil transport on water shall be the greatest individual distance rather than a summation of each calculated planning distance.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 The planning distance formula for transport on moving waterways contains three variables: the velocity of the navigable water (v), the response time interval (t), and a conversion factor (c). The velocity, v, is determined by using the Chezy-Manning equation, which, in this case, models the flood flow rate of water in open channels. The Chezy-Manning equation contains three variables which must be determined by facility owners or operators. Manning's Roughness Coefficient (for flood flow rates), n, can be determined from Table 1 of this attachment. The hydraulic radius, r, can be estimated using the average mid-channel depth from charts provided by the sources listed in Table 2 of this attachment. The average slope of the river, s, can be determined using topographic maps that can be ordered from the U.S. Geological Survey, as listed in Table 2 of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 Table 3 of this attachment contains specified time intervals for estimating the arrival of response resources at the scene of a discharge. Assuming no prior planning, response resources should be able to arrive at the discharge site within 12 hours of the discovery of any oil discharge in Higher Volume Port Areas and within 24 hours in Great Lakes and all other river, canal, inland, and nearshore areas. The specified time intervals in Table 3 of appendix C are to be used only to aid in the identification of whether a facility could cause substantial harm to the environment. Once it is determined that a plan must be developed for the facility, the owner or operator shall reference appendix E to this part to determine appropriate resource levels and response times.

A specific length, such as 100 feet, can be marked off along the shoreline. A float can be dropped into the stream above the mark, and the time required for the float to travel the distance can be used to determine the velocity in feet per second. However, this method will not yield an average velocity for the length of the stream, but a velocity only for the specific location of measurement. In addition, the flow rate will vary depending on weather conditions such as wind and rainfall. It is recommended that facility owners or operators repeat the measurement under a variety of conditions to obtain the most accurate estimate of the surface water velocity under adverse weather conditions.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 The planning distance calculations for moving and still navigable waters are based on worst case discharges of persistent oils. Persistent oils are of concern because they can remain in the water for significant periods of time and can potentially exist in large quantities downstream. Owners or operators of facilities that store persistent as well as non-persistent oils may use a comparable formula. The volume of oil discharged is not included as part of the planning distance calculation for moving navigable waters. Facilities that will meet this substantial harm criterion are those with facility capacities greater than or equal to 1 million gallons. It is assumed that these facilities are capable of having an oil discharge of sufficient quantity to cause injury to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments or shut down a public drinking water intake. While owners or operators of transfer facilities that store greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons are not required to use a planning distance formula for purposes of the substantial harm criteria, they should use a planning distance calculation in the development of facility-specific response plans.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Specified Time Intervals------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Substantial harm planning</p><p class="depth0">Operating areas                        time (hrs)------------------------------------------------------------------------Higher volume port area...................  12 hour arrival+3 hour</p><p class="depth0">deployment=15 hours.Great Lakes...............................  24 hour arrival+3 hour</p><p class="depth0">deployment=27 hours.All other rivers and canals, inland, and    24 hour arrival+3 hour</p><p class="depth0">nearshore areas.                            deployment=27 hours.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2.6 Example of the Planning Distance Calculation for Oil Transport on Moving Navigable Waters.

Solving:s = [(727 ft - 1710 ft) / 25 miles] x [1 mile/5280 feet] = 1.3 x</p><p class="depth0">10-4</p><p class="depth0">The average mid-channel depth is found by averaging the mid-channel depth for each mile along the length of the river between the facility and the public drinking water intake or the fish or wildlife or sensitive environment (or 20 miles downstream if applicable). This value is multiplied by 0.667 to obtain the hydraulic radius. The mid-channel depth is found by obtaining values for r and s from the sources shown in Table 2 for the Monongahela River.
Solving:r = 0.667 x 20 feet = 13.33 feetSolve for v using:v = 1.5/n x r\2/3\ x s\1/2\:v = [1.5/0.035] x (13.33)\2/3\ x (1.3 x 10-4)\1/2\v = 2.73 feet/second</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Find t from Table 3 of this attachment. The Monongahela River's resource response time is 27 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Solve for planning distance, d:
d = v x t x cd = (2.73 ft/sec) x (27 hours) x (0.68 sec[omega] mile/hr[omega] ft)d = 50 miles
Therefore, 50 miles downstream is the appropriate planning distance for this facility.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Oil Transport on Still Water</p><p class="depth0">3.1 For bodies of water including lakes or ponds that do not have a measurable velocity, the spreading of the oil over the surface must be considered. Owners or operators of facilities located next to still water bodies may use a comparable means of calculating

the planning distance. If a comparable formula is used, documentation of the reliability and analytical soundness of the comparable calculation must be attached to the response plan cover sheet.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Example of the Planning Distance Calculation for Oil Transport on Still Water. To assist those facilities which could potentially discharge into a still body of water, the following analysis was performed to provide an example of the type of formula that may be used to calculate the planning distance. For this example, a worst case discharge of 2,000,000 gallons is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The surface area in square feet covered by an oil discharge on still water, A1, can be determined by the following formula, \2\ where V is the volume of the discharge in gallons and C is a constant conversion factor:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Huang, J.C. and Monastero, F.C., 1982.

In reality, the outfall of the discharge will direct the oil to the surface of the water where it intersects the shoreline. Although the oil will not spread uniformly in all directions, it is assumed that the discharge will spread from the shoreline into a semi-circle (this assumption does not account for winds or wave action).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The area of a circle=[dagger] r\2\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To account for the assumption that oil will spread in a semi-circular shape, the area of a circle is divided by 2 and is designated as A2.

Persistent oils are of primary concern because they can potentially cause harm over a greater distance. For persistent oils discharged into tidal waters, the planning distance is 15 miles from the facility down current during ebb tide and to the point of maximum tidal influence or 15 miles, whichever is less, during flood tide.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 For non-persistent oils discharged into tidal waters, the planning distance is 5 miles from the facility down current during ebb tide and to the point of maximum tidal influence or 5 miles, whichever is less, during flood tide.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Example of Determining the Planning Distance for Two Types of Navigable Water Conditions. Below is an example of how to determine the proper planning distance when a facility could impact two types of navigable water conditions: moving water and tidal water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Facility X stores persistent oil and is located downstream from locks along a slow moving river which is affected by tides. The river velocity, v, is determined to be 0.5 feet/second from the Chezy-Manning equation used to calculate oil transport on moving navigable waters. The specified time interval, t, obtained from Table 3 of this attachment for river areas is 27 hours. Therefore, solving for the planning distance, d:
d=vxtxcd=(0.5 ft/sec)x(27 hours)x(0.68 secmile/hrft)d=9.18 miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> However, the planning distance for maximum tidal influence down current during ebb tide is 15 miles, which is greater than the calculated 9.18 miles. Therefore, 15 miles downstream is the appropriate planning distance for this facility.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Oil Transport Over Land</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Facility owners or operators must evaluate the potential for oil to be transported over land to navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator must evaluate the likelihood that portions of a worst case discharge would reach navigable

waters via open channel flow or from sheet flow across the land, or be prevented from reaching navigable waters when trapped in natural or man-made depressions excluding secondary containment structures.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 As discharged oil travels over land, it may enter a storm drain or open concrete channel intended for drainage. It is assumed that once oil reaches such an inlet, it will flow into the receiving navigable water. During a storm event, it is highly probable that the oil will either flow into the drainage structures or follow the natural contours of the land and flow into the navigable water. Expected minimum and maximum velocities are provided as examples of open concrete channel and pipe flow. The ranges listed below reflect minimum and maximum velocities used as design criteria. \4\ The calculation below demonstrates that the time required for oil to travel through a storm drain or open concrete channel to navigable water is negligible and can be considered instantaneous.

Factors to be considered in assessing oil transport over land to storm drains shall include the topography of the surrounding area, drainage patterns, man-made barriers (excluding secondary containment structures), and soil distribution and porosity. Storm drains or concrete drainage channels that are located in close proximity to the facility can provide a direct pathway to navigable waters, regardless of the length of the drainage pipe. If D1 is less than or equal to 0.5 mile, a discharge from the facility could pose substantial harm because the time to travel the distance from the storm drain to the navigable water (D2) is virtually instantaneous.</p><p class="depth0">5.7 A facility's proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments not bordering a navigable water, as depicted as D4 in Figure C-I of this attachment, must also be considered, regardless of the distance from the facility to navigable waters. Factors to be considered in assessing oil transport over land to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments should include the topography of the surrounding area, drainage patterns, man-made barriers (excluding secondary containment structures), and soil distribution and porosity.</p><p class="depth0">5.8 If a facility is not found to pose substantial harm to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments not bordering navigable waters via oil transport on land, then supporting documentation should be maintained at the facility. However, such documentation should be submitted with the response plan if a facility is found to pose substantial harm.

Appendix D to Part 112--Determination of a Worst Case Discharge</p><p class="depth0">Planning Volume</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Instructions</p><p class="depth0">1.1 An owner or operator is required to complete this worksheet if the facility meets the criteria, as presented in appendix C to this part, or it is determined by the RA that the facility could cause substantial harm to the environment. The calculation of a worst case discharge planning volume is used for emergency planning purposes, and is required in 40 CFR 112.20 for facility owners or operators who must prepare a response plan. When planning for the amount of resources and equipment necessary to respond to the worst case discharge planning volume, adverse weather conditions must be taken into consideration. An owner or operator is required to determine the facility's worst case discharge planning volume from either part A of this appendix for an onshore storage facility, or part B of this appendix for an onshore production facility. The worksheet considers the provision of adequate secondary containment at a facility.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 For onshore storage facilities and production facilities, permanently manifolded oil storage tanks are defined as tanks that are designed, installed, and/or operated in such a manner that the multiple tanks function as one storage unit (i.e., multiple tank volumes are equalized). In a worst case discharge scenario, a single failure could cause the discharge of the contents of more than one tank. The owner or operator must provide evidence in the response plan that tanks with common piping or piping systems are not operated as one unit. If such evidence is provided and is acceptable to the RA, the worst case discharge planning volume would be based on the capacity of the largest oil storage tank within a common secondary containment area or the largest oil storage tank within a single secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For permanently manifolded tanks that function as one oil storage unit, the worst case discharge planning volume would be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifolded tanks or the capacity of the largest single oil storage tank within a secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For purposes of this rule, permanently manifolded tanks that are separated by internal divisions for each tank are considered to be single tanks and individual manifolded tank volumes are not combined.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 For production facilities, the presence of exploratory wells, production wells, and oil storage tanks must be considered in the calculation. Part B of this appendix takes these additional factors into consideration and provides steps for their inclusion in the total worst case discharge planning volume. Onshore oil production facilities may include all wells, flowlines, separation equipment, storage facilities, gathering lines, and auxiliary non-transportation-related equipment and facilities in a single geographical oil or gas field operated by a single operator. Although a potential worst case discharge planning volume is calculated within each section of the worksheet, the final worst case amount depends on the risk parameter that results in the greatest volume.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Marine transportation-related transfer facilities that contain fixed aboveground onshore structures used for bulk oil storage are jointly regulated by EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and are termed ``complexes.'' Because the USCG also requires response plans from transportation-related facilities to address a worst case discharge of oil, a separate calculation for the worst case discharge planning volume for USCG-related facilities is included in the USCG IFR (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability). All complexes that are jointly regulated by EPA and the USCG must compare both calculations for worst case discharge planning volume derived by using the EPA and USCG methodologies and plan for whichever volume is greater.</p><p class="depth0">PART A: WORST CASE DISCHARGE PLANNING VOLUME CALCULATION FOR ONSHORE</p><p class="depth0">STORAGE FACILITIES \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ``Storage facilities'' represent all facilities subject to this part, excluding oil production facilities.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Part A of this worksheet is to be completed by the owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility (excluding oil production facilities) if the facility meets the criteria as presented in appendix C to this part, or if it is determined by the RA that the facility could cause substantial harm to the environment.

The result of this comparison will determine the method used to calculate the production volume for the production facility. This production volume is to be used to calculate the worst case discharge planning volume in part B of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Description of Methods</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Method A</p><p class="depth0">If the well rate would overwhelm the response efforts (i.e., rate of well/rate of recovery =1), then the production volume would be the 30-day forecasted well rate for a well 10,000 feet deep or less, or the 45-day forecasted well rate for a well deeper than 10,000 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For wells 10,000 feet deep or less:Production volume=30 days x rate of well.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For wells deeper than 10,000 feet:Production volume=45 days x rate of well.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Method B</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 If the rate of recovery would be greater than the well rate (i.e., rate of well/rate of recovery <1), then the production volume would equal the sum of two terms:
Production volume=discharge volume1 + discharge</p><p class="depth0">volume2</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 The first term represents the volume of the oil discharged from the well between the time of the blowout and the time the response resources are on scene and recovering oil (discharge volume1).
Discharge volume1 = (days unattended+days to respond) x (rate</p><p class="depth0">of well)</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 The second term represents the volume of oil discharged from the well after the response resources begin operating until the discharge is stopped, adjusted for the recovery rate of the response resources (discharge volume2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For wells 10,000 feet deep or less:Discharge volume2 = [30 days-(days unattended + days to</p><p class="depth0">respond)] x (rate of well) x (rate of well/rate of recovery)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For wells deeper than 10,000 feet:Discharge volume2 = [45 days-(days unattended + days to</p><p class="depth0">respond)] x (rate of well) x (rate of well/rate of recovery)</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Example</p><p class="depth0">3.1 A facility consists of two production wells producing under pressure, which are both less than 10,000 feet deep. The well rate of well A is 5 barrels per day, and the well rate of well B is 10 barrels per day. The facility is unattended for a maximum of 7 days. The facility operator estimates that it will take 2 days to have response equipment and personnel on scene and responding to a blowout, and that the projected rate of recovery will be 20 barrels per day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, the facility operator determines that the highest output well is well B. The facility operator calculates the ratio of the rate of well to the rate of recovery:
10 barrels per day/20 barrels per day=0.5 Because the ratio is less than</p><p class="depth0">one, the facility operator will use Method B to calculate the</p><p class="depth0">production volume.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The first term of the equation is:
Discharge volume1 = (7 days + 2 days) x (10 barrels per</p><p class="depth0">day)=90 barrels</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The second term of the equation is:
Discharge volume2 = [30 days--(7 days + 2 days)] x (10</p><p class="depth0">barrels per day) x (0.5)=105 barrels</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Therefore, the production volume is:
Production volume=90 barrels + 105 barrels=195 barrels</p><p class="depth0">3.2 If the recovery rate was 5 barrels per day, the ratio of rate of well to rate of recovery would be 2, so the facility operator would use Method A. The production volume would have been:
30 days x 10 barrels per day=300 barrels

These conditions vary widely based on location and season. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a single stockpile of response equipment that will function effectively in each geographic location (i.e., operating area).</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil in more than one operating environment as indicated in Table 1 of this appendix must identify equipment capable of successfully functioning in each operating environment.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 When identifying equipment for the response plan (based on the use of this appendix), a facility owner or operator must consider the inherent limitations of the operability of equipment components and response systems. The criteria in Table 1 of this appendix shall be used to evaluate the operability in a given environment. These criteria reflect the general conditions in certain operating environments.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1 The Regional Administrator may require documentation that the boom identified in a facility response plan meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Absent acceptable documentation, the Regional Administrator may require that the boom be tested to demonstrate that it meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Testing must be in accordance with ASTM F 715, ASTM F 989, or other tests approved by EPA as deemed appropriate (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for general availability of documents).</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support response operations in an operating environment must be designed to function in the same conditions. For example, boats that deploy or support skimmers or boom must be capable of being safely operated in the significant wave heights listed for the applicable operating environment.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 A facility owner or operator shall refer to the applicable Area Contingency Plan (ACP), where available, to determine if ice, debris, and weather-related visibility are significant factors to evaluate the operability of equipment. The ACP may also identify the average temperature ranges expected in the facility's operating area. All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to operate within those conditions or ranges.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 This appendix provides information on response resource mobilization and response times. The distance of the facility from the storage location of the response resources must be used to determine whether the resources can arrive on-scene within the stated time. A facility owner or operator shall include the time for notification, mobilization, and travel of resources identified to meet the medium and Tier 1 worst case discharge requirements identified in sections 4.3 and 9.3 of this appendix (for medium discharges) and section 5.3 of this appendix (for worst case discharges). The facility owner or operator must plan for notification and mobilization of Tier 2 and 3 response resources as necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on-scene in accordance with section 5.3 of this appendix. An on-water speed of 5 knots and a land speed of 35 miles per hour is assumed, unless the facility owner or operator can demonstrate otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 In identifying equipment, the facility owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model. For oil recovery devices, the effective daily recovery capacity, as determined using section 6 of this appendix, must be included. For boom, the overall boom height (draft and freeboard) shall be included. A facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that the identified boom has compatible connectors.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Determining Response Resources Required for Small Discharges--</p><p class="depth0">Petroleum Oils and Non-Petroleum Oils Other Than Animal Fats and</p><p class="depth0">Vegetable Oils</p><p class="depth0">3.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to respond to a small discharge. A small discharge is defined as any discharge volume less than or equal to 2,100 gallons, but not to exceed the calculated worst case discharge. The equipment must be designed to function in the operating environment at the point of expected use.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) must also consider planning quantities for the transportation-related transfer portion of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 Petroleum oils. The USCG planning level that corresponds to EPA's ``small discharge'' is termed ``the average most probable discharge.'' A USCG rule found at 33 CFR 154.1020 defines ``the average most probable discharge'' as the lesser of 50 barrels (2,100 gallons) or 1 percent of the volume of the worst case discharge. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport petroleum oils must compare oil discharge volumes for a small discharge and an average most probable discharge, and plan for whichever quantity is greater.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils must plan for oil discharge volumes for a small discharge. There is no USCG planning level that directly corresponds to EPA's ``small discharge.'' However, the USCG (at 33 CFR 154.545) has requirements to identify equipment to contain oil resulting from an operational discharge.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 The response resources shall, as appropriate, include:</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1 One thousand feet of containment boom (or, for complexes with marine transfer components, 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts oil transfers to or from the facility, whichever is greater), and a means of deploying it within 1 hour of the discovery of a discharge;</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2 Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery capacity equal to the amount of oil discharged in a small discharge or greater which is available at the

facility within 2 hours of the detection of an oil discharge; and</p><p class="depth0">3.3.3 Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in section 12.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Determining Response Resources Required for Medium Discharges--</p><p class="depth0">Petroleum Oils and Non-Petroleum Oils Other Than Animal Fats and</p><p class="depth0">Vegetable Oils</p><p class="depth0">4.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to respond to a medium discharge of oil for that facility. This will require response resources capable of containing and collecting up to 36,000 gallons of oil or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. All equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in Table 1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also consider planning quantities for the transportation-related transfer portion of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Petroleum oils. The USCG planning level that corresponds to EPA's ``medium discharge'' is termed ``the maximum most probable discharge.'' The USCG rule found at 33 CFR part 154 defines ``the maximum most probable discharge'' as a discharge of 1,200 barrels (50,400 gallons) or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport petroleum oils must compare calculated discharge volumes for a medium discharge and a maximum most probable discharge, and plan for whichever quantity is greater.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils must plan for oil discharge volumes for a medium discharge. For non-petroleum oils, there is no USCG planning level that directly corresponds to EPA's ``medium discharge.''</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Oil recovery devices identified to meet the applicable medium discharge volume planning criteria must be located such that they are capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours in higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes and within 12 hours in all other areas. Higher volume port areas and Great Lakes areas are defined in section 1.1 of appendix C to this part.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil are critical to reduce discharge impact, the owner or operator must determine response resources using an effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices equal to 50 percent of the planning volume applicable for the facility as determined in section 4.1 of this appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 In addition to oil recovery capacity, the plan shall, as appropriate, identify sufficient quantity of containment boom available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to arrive within the required response times for oil collection and containment and for protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments'' (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability) and the applicable ACP. Although 40 CFR part 112 does not set required quantities of boom for oil collection and containment, the response plan shall identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of the quantity of boom identified in the plan for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet section 12.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this level, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be derated (downgraded) to the limits of the available storage capacity.</p><p class="depth0">4.7 The following is an example of a medium discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a higher volume port area: The facility's largest aboveground storage tank volume is 840,000 gallons. Ten percent of this capacity is 84,000 gallons. Because 10 percent of the facility's largest tank, or 84,000 gallons, is greater than 36,000 gallons, 36,000 gallons is used as the planning volume. The effective daily recovery capacity is 50 percent of the planning volume, or 18,000 gallons per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet this capacity must be calculated using the procedures in section 6 of this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on-scene must equal twice the daily recovery capacity as indicated in section 12.2 of this appendix, or 36,000 gallons per day. This is the information the facility owner or operator must use to identify and ensure the availability of the required response resources, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2. The facility owner shall also identify how much boom is available for use.
5.0 Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case Discharge</p><p class="depth0">to the Maximum Extent Practicable</p><p class="depth0">5.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure the availability of, by

contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, sufficient response resources to respond to the worst case discharge of oil to the maximum extent practicable. Sections 7 and 10 of this appendix describe the method to determine the necessary response resources. Worksheets are provided as Attachments E-1 and E-2 at the end of this appendix to simplify the procedures involved in calculating the planning volume for response resources for the worst case discharge.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also consider planning for the worst case discharge at the transportation-related portion of the facility. The USCG requires that transportation-related facility owners or operators use a different calculation for the worst case discharge in the revisions to 33 CFR part 154. Owners or operators of complex facilities that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must compare both calculations of worst case discharge derived by EPA and the USCG and plan for whichever volume is greater.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Oil discharge response resources identified in the response plan and available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to meet the applicable worst case discharge planning volume must be located such that they are capable of arriving at the scene of a discharge within the times specified for the applicable response tier listed as follows
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Tier 1 (in   Tier 2 (in   Tier 3 (in</p><p class="depth0">hours)       hours)       hours)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Higher volume port areas.................................................            6           30           54Great Lakes..............................................................           12           36           60All other river and canal, inland, and nearshore areas...................           12           36           60----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The three levels of response tiers apply to the amount of time in which facility owners or operators must plan for response resources to arrive at the scene of a discharge to respond to the worst case discharge planning volume. For example, at a worst case discharge in an inland area, the first tier of response resources (i.e., that amount of on-water and shoreline cleanup capacity necessary to respond to the fraction of the worst case discharge as indicated through the series of steps described in sections 7.2 and 7.3 or sections 10.2 and 10.3 of this appendix) would arrive at the scene of the discharge within 12 hours; the second tier of response resources would arrive within 36 hours; and the third tier of response resources would arrive within 60 hours.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in the response plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix. A facility owner or operator shall identify the storage locations of all response resources used for each tier. The owner or operator of a facility whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 of this appendix shall, as appropriate, identify sources of additional equipment, their location, and the arrangements made to obtain this equipment during a response. The owner or operator of a facility whose calculated planning volume exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 of this appendix shall, as appropriate, identify sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed in Tier 3 or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower. The resources identified above the cap shall be capable of arriving on-scene not later than the Tier 3 response times in section 5.3 of this appendix. No contract is required. While general listings of available response equipment may be used to identify additional sources (i.e., ``public'' resources vs. ``private'' resources), the response plan shall identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator has considered in his or her planning. When listing USCG-classified oil spill removal organization(s) that have sufficient removal capacity to recover the volume above the response capacity cap for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 of this appendix, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 A facility owner or operator shall identify the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet section 12.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be derated (downgraded) to the limits of the available storage capacity.</p><p class="depth0">5.6 When selecting response resources necessary to meet the response plan requirements, the facility owner or operator shall, as appropriate, ensure that a portion of those resources is capable of being used in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. For any EPA-regulated facility that is required to plan for response in shallow water, at least 20 percent of the on-water response equipment identified for the applicable operating area shall, as appropriate, be capable of operating in water of 6 feet or less depth.</p><p class="depth0">5.7 In addition to oil spill recovery devices, a facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient quantities of boom that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to arrive on-

scene within the specified response times for oil containment and collection. The specific quantity of boom required for collection and containment will depend on the facility-specific information and response strategies employed. A facility owner or operator shall, as appropriate, also identify sufficient quantities of oil containment boom to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments'' (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability), and the applicable ACP. Refer to this guidance document for the number of days and geographic areas (i.e., operating environments) specified in Table 2 and Table 6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5.8 A facility owner or operator shall also identify, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of an oil spill removal organization(s) (as described in Sec. 112.2) capable of responding to a shoreline cleanup operation involving the calculated volume of oil and emulsified oil that might impact the affected shoreline. The volume of oil that shall, as appropriate, be planned for is calculated through the application of factors contained in Tables 2, 3, 6, and 7 of this appendix. The volume calculated from these tables is intended to assist the facility owner or operator to identify an oil spill removal organization with sufficient resources and expertise.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery</p><p class="depth0">Devices</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Oil recovery devices identified by a facility owner or operator must be identified by the manufacturer, model, and effective daily recovery capacity. These capacities must be used to determine whether there is sufficient capacity to meet the applicable planning criteria for a small discharge, a medium discharge, and a worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 To determine the effective daily recovery capacity of oil recovery devices, the formula listed in section 6.2.1 of this appendix shall be used. This formula considers potential limitations due to available daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of emulsified oil in the recovered material. The RA may assign a lower efficiency factor to equipment listed in a response plan if it is determined that such a reduction is warranted.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 The following formula shall be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity:
R = T x 24 hours x E
where:
R--Effective daily recovery capacity;T--Throughput rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity); andE--20 percent efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by the</p><p class="depth0">Regional Administrator).</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of liquid, throughput rate shall be calculated using the pump capacity.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 For belt or moptype devices, the throughput rate shall be calculated using the speed of the belt or mop through the device, assumed thickness of oil adhering to or collected by the device, and surface area of the belt or mop. For purposes of this calculation, the assumed thickness of oil will be \1/4\ inch.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4 Facility owners or operators that include oil recovery devices whose throughput is not measurable using a pump capacity or belt/mop speed may provide information to support an alternative method of calculation. This information must be submitted following the procedures in section 6.3.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 As an alternative to section 6.2 of this appendix, a facility owner or operator may submit adequate evidence that a different effective daily recovery capacity should be applied for a specific oil recovery device. Adequate evidence is actual verified performance data in discharge conditions or tests using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard F 631-99, F 808-83 (1999), or an equivalent test approved by EPA as deemed appropriate (see Appendix E to this part, section 13, for general availability of documents).</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 The following formula must be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity under this alternative:
R = D x U
where:R--Effective daily recovery capacity;D--Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 26 in F 808-83;</p><p class="depth0">Item 13.2.16 in F 631-99; or actual performance data); andU--Hours per day that equipment can operate under discharge conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Ten hours per day must be used unless a facility owner or</p><p class="depth0">operator can demonstrate that the recovery operation can be</p><p class="depth0">sustained for longer periods.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 A facility owner or operator submitting a response plan shall provide data that supports the effective daily recovery capacities for the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these calculations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a manufacturer's rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute (gpm).
267 gpm=381 barrels per hour (bph)R=381 bphx24 hr/dayx0.2=1,829 barrels per day</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery rate is determined to be 220 gpm. The facility owner or operator identifies sufficient resources available to support operations for 12 hours per day.

Determination of alternative efficiency factors under section 6.2 of this appendix or the acceptability of an alternative effective daily recovery capacity under section 6.3 of this appendix will be made by the Regional Administrator as deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Calculating Planning Volumes for a Worst Case Discharge--Petroleum</p><p class="depth0">Oils and Non-Petroleum Oils Other Than Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils</p><p class="depth0">7.1 A facility owner or operator shall plan for a response to the facility's worst case discharge. The planning for on-water oil recovery must take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to evaporative and natural dissipation, potential increases in volume due to emulsification, and the potential for deposition of oil on the shoreline. The procedures for non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils are discussed in section 7.7 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 The following procedures must be used by a facility owner or operator in determining the required on-water oil recovery capacity:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 The following must be determined: the worst case discharge volume of oil in the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility [persistent (Groups 2, 3, 4, 5) or non-persistent (Group 1)]; and the facility's specific operating area. See sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.8 of this appendix for the definitions of non-persistent and persistent oils, respectively. Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from different oil groups must calculate each group separately, unless the oil group constitutes 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total oil storage capacity. This information is to be used with Table 2 of this appendix to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for removal capacity planning. Table 2 of this appendix divides the volume into three categories: oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 The on-water oil recovery volume shall, as appropriate, be adjusted using the appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 3 of this appendix. Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from different petroleum groups must compare the on-water recovery volume for each oil group (unless the oil group constitutes 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total storage capacity) and use the calculation that results in the largest on-water oil recovery volume to plan for the amount of response resources for a worst case discharge.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.3 The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil recovery resource mobilization factor found in Table 4 of this appendix from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be identified or contracted to arrive on-scene within the applicable time for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher volume port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that they are capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours for Tier 1, 30 hours for Tier 2, and 54 hours for Tier 3 of the discovery of an oil discharge. For all other rivers and canals, inland, nearshore areas, and the Great Lakes, these tiers are 12, 36, and 60 hours.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.4 The resulting on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day for each tier is used to identify response resources necessary to sustain operations in the applicable operating area. The equipment shall be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in Table 2 of this appendix. The facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure the availability, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, of sufficient oil spill recovery devices to provide the effective daily oil recovery capacity required. If the required capacity exceeds the applicable cap specified in Table 5 of this appendix, then a facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, only for the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but shall identify sources of additional resources as indicated in section 5.4 of this appendix. The owner or operator of a facility whose planning volume exceeded the cap in 1993 must make arrangements to identify and ensure the availability, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, for additional capacity to be under contract by 1998 or 2003, as appropriate. For a facility that handles multiple groups of oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity for each oil group is calculated before applying the cap. The oil group calculation resulting in the largest on-water recovery volume must be used to plan for the amount of response resources for a worst case discharge, unless the oil group comprises 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total oil storage capacity.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 The procedures discussed in sections 7.3.1-7.3.3 of this appendix must be used to calculate the planning volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity (for Group 1 through Group 4 oils).</p><p class="depth0">7.3.1 The following must be determined: the worst case discharge volume of oil for

the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility [persistent (Groups 2, 3, or 4) or non-persistent (Group 1)]; and the geographic area(s) in which the facility operates (i.e., operating areas). For a facility handling, storing, or transporting oil from different groups, each group must be calculated separately. Using this information, Table 2 of this appendix must be used to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.2 The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described in section 7.2.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.3 The resulting volume shall be used to identify an oil spill removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 A response plan must identify response resources with fire fighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group 1 through Group 4 oils that does not have adequate fire fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate fire fighting resources. The facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of these resources. The response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for Group 1 through Group 4 oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained fire fighting resources are available within a reasonable response time to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 The following is an example of the procedure described above in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of this appendix: A facility with a 270,000 barrel (11.3 million gallons) capacity for 6 oil (specific gravity 0.96) is located in a higher volume port area. The facility is on a peninsula and has docks on both the ocean and bay sides. The facility has four aboveground oil storage tanks with a combined total capacity of 80,000 barrels (3.36 million gallons) and no secondary containment. The remaining facility tanks are inside secondary containment structures. The largest aboveground oil storage tank (90,000 barrels or 3.78 million gallons) has its own secondary containment. Two 50,000 barrel (2.1 million gallon) tanks (that are not connected by a manifold) are within a common secondary containment tank area, which is capable of holding 100,000 barrels (4.2 million gallons) plus sufficient freeboard.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.1 The worst case discharge for the facility is calculated by adding the capacity of all aboveground oil storage tanks without secondary containment (80,000 barrels) plus the capacity of the largest aboveground oil storage tank inside secondary containment. The resulting worst case discharge volume is 170,000 barrels or 7.14 million gallons.</p><p class="depth0">7.5.2 Because the requirements for Tiers 1, 2, and 3 for inland and nearshore exceed the caps identified in Table 5 of this appendix, the facility owner will contract for a response to 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) for Tier 1, 20,000 bpd for Tier 2, and 40,000 bpd for Tier 3. Resources for the remaining 7,850 bpd for Tier 1, 9,750 bpd for Tier 2, and 7,600 bpd for Tier 3 shall be identified but need not be contracted for in advance. The facility owner or operator shall, as appropriate, also identify or contract for quantities of boom identified in their response plan for the protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments within the area potentially impacted by a worst case discharge from the facility. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments,'' (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability) and the applicable ACP. Attachment C-III to Appendix C provides a method for calculating a planning distance to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments and public drinking water intakes that may be impacted in the event of a worst case discharge.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 The procedures discussed in sections 7.6.1-7.6.3 of this appendix must be used to determine appropriate response resources for facilities with Group 5 oils.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.1 The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group 5 oils shall, as appropriate, identify the response resources available by contract or other approved means, as described in Sec. 112.2.

The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group 5 oils that does not have adequate fire fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate fire fighting resources. The facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of these resources. The response plan shall also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for Group 5 oil fires.

The procedures described in sections 7.7.1 through 7.7.5 of this appendix must be used to determine appropriate response plan development and evaluation criteria for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils. Refer to section 11 of this appendix for information on the limitations on the use of chemical agents for inland and nearshore areas.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.1 An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils must provide information in his or her plan that identifies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Procedures and strategies for responding to a worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sources of the equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and mitigate such a discharge.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.2 An owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils must ensure that any equipment identified in a response plan is capable of operating in the conditions expected in the geographic area(s) (i.e., operating environments) in which the facility operates using the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. When evaluating the operability of equipment, the facility owner or operator must consider limitations that are identified in the appropriate ACPs, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ice conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Debris;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Temperature ranges; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Weather-related visibility.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.3 The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports non-petroleum oils other than animal fats and vegetable oils must identify the response resources that are available by contract or other approved means, as described in Sec. 112.2.

8.0 Determining Response Resources Required for Small Discharges--Animal</p><p class="depth0">Fats and Vegetable Oils</p><p class="depth0">8.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to respond to a small discharge of animal fats or vegetable oils. A small discharge is defined as any discharge volume less than or equal to 2,100 gallons, but not to exceed the calculated worst case discharge. The equipment must be designed to function in the operating environment at the point of expected use.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also consider planning quantities for the marine transportation-related portion of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 The USCG planning level that corresponds to EPA's ``small discharge'' is termed ``the average most probable discharge.'' A USCG rule found at 33 CFR 154.1020 defines ``the average most probable discharge'' as the lesser of 50 barrels (2,100 gallons) or 1 percent of the volume of the worst case discharge. Owners or operators of

complexes that handle, store, or transport animal fats and vegetable oils must compare oil discharge volumes for a small discharge and an average most probable discharge, and plan for whichever quantity is greater.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 The response resources shall, as appropriate, include:</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 One thousand feet of containment boom (or, for complexes with marine transfer components, 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts oil transfers to or from the facility, whichever is greater), and a means of deploying it within 1 hour of the discovery of a discharge;</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery capacity equal to the amount of oil discharged in a small discharge or greater which is available at the facility within 2 hours of the detection of a discharge; and</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in section 12.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Determining Response Resources Required for Medium Discharges--</p><p class="depth0">Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils</p><p class="depth0">9.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to respond to a medium discharge of animal fats or vegetable oils for that facility. This will require response resources capable of containing and collecting up to 36,000 gallons of oil or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. All equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in Table 1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Complexes that are regulated by EPA and the USCG must also consider planning quantities for the transportation-related transfer portion of the facility. Owners or operators of complexes that handle, store, or transport animal fats or vegetable oils must plan for oil discharge volumes for a medium discharge. For non-petroleum oils, there is no USCG planning level that directly corresponds to EPA's ``medium discharge.'' Although the USCG does not have planning requirements for medium discharges, they do have requirements (at 33 CFR 154.545) to identify equipment to contain oil resulting from an operational discharge.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Oil recovery devices identified to meet the applicable medium discharge volume planning criteria must be located such that they are capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours in higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes and within 12 hours in all other areas. Higher volume port areas and Great Lakes areas are defined in section 1.1 of appendix C to this part.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil are critical to reduce discharge impact, the owner or operator must determine response resources using an effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices equal to 50 percent of the planning volume applicable for the facility as determined in section 9.1 of this appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 In addition to oil recovery capacity, the plan shall, as appropriate, identify sufficient quantity of containment boom available, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, to arrive within the required response times for oil collection and containment and for protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. For further description of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, see Appendices I, II, and III to DOC/NOAA's ``Guidance for Facility and Vessel Response Plans: Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments'' (59 FR 14713-22, March 29, 1994) and the applicable ACP. Although 40 CFR part 112 does not set required quantities of boom for oil collection and containment, the response plan shall identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of the quantity of boom identified in the plan for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">9.6 The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet section 12.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this level, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be derated (downgraded) to the limits of the available storage capacity.</p><p class="depth0">9.7 The following is an example of a medium discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a higher volume port area:</p><p class="depth0">The facility's largest aboveground storage tank volume is 840,000 gallons. Ten percent of this capacity is 84,000 gallons. Because 10 percent of the facility's largest tank, or 84,000 gallons, is greater than 36,000 gallons, 36,000 gallons is used as the planning volume. The effective daily recovery capacity is 50 percent of the planning volume, or 18,000 gallons per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet this capacity must be calculated using the procedures in section 6 of this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on-scene must equal twice the daily recovery capacity as indicated in section 12.2 of this appendix, or 36,000 gallons per day. This is the information the facility owner or operator must use to identify and ensure the availability of the required response resources, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2. The facility owner shall also identify how much boom is available for use.</p><p class="depth0">10.0 Calculating Planning Volumes for a Worst Case Discharge--Animal</p><p class="depth0">Fats and Vegetable Oils.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 A facility owner or operator shall plan for a response to the facility's worst case discharge. The planning for on-water oil recovery must take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to physical, chemical, and biological processes, potential increases in volume due to emulsification, and the potential for deposition of oil on the shoreline or on sediments. The response planning procedures for animal fats and vegetable oils are discussed in section 10.7 of this appendix. You may use alternate response planning procedures for animal fats and vegetable oils if those procedures result in environmental protection equivalent to that provided by the procedures in section 10.7 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 The following procedures must be used by a facility owner or operator in determining the required on-water oil recovery capacity:</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 The following must be determined: the worst case discharge volume of oil in the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (Groups A, B, C); and the facility's specific operating area. See sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.9 of this appendix for the definitions of animal fats and vegetable oils and groups thereof. Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from different oil groups must calculate each group separately, unless the oil group constitutes 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total oil storage capacity. This information is to be used with Table 6 of this appendix to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for removal capacity planning. Table 6 of this appendix divides the volume into three categories: oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 The on-water oil recovery volume shall, as appropriate, be adjusted using the appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 7 of this appendix. Facilities that handle, store, or transport oil from different groups must compare the on-water recovery volume for each oil group (unless the oil group constitutes 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's total storage capacity) and use the calculation that results in the largest on-water oil recovery volume to plan for the amount of response resources for a worst case discharge.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.3 The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil recovery resource mobilization factor found in Table 4 of this appendix from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be identified or contracted to arrive on-scene within the applicable time for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher volume port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that they are capable of arriving on-scene within 6 hours for Tier 1, 30 hours for Tier 2, and 54 hours for Tier 3 of the discovery of a discharge. For all other rivers and canals, inland, nearshore areas, and the Great Lakes, these tiers are 12, 36, and 60 hours.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.4 The resulting on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day for each tier is used to identify response resources necessary to sustain operations in the applicable operating area. The equipment shall be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in Table 6 of this appendix. The facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of sufficient oil spill recovery devices to provide the effective daily oil recovery capacity required. If the required capacity exceeds the applicable cap specified in Table 5 of this appendix, then a facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, only for the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but shall identify sources of additional resources as indicated in section 5.4 of this appendix. The owner or operator of a facility whose planning volume exceeded the cap in 1998 must make arrangements to identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of additional capacity to be under contract by 2003, as appropriate. For a facility that handles multiple groups of oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity for each oil group is calculated before applying the cap. The oil group calculation resulting in the largest on-water recovery volume must be used to plan for the amount of response resources for a worst case discharge, unless the oil group comprises 10 percent or less by volume of the facility's oil storage capacity.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 The procedures discussed in sections 10.3.1 through 10.3.3 of this appendix must be used to calculate the planning volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity (for Groups A and B oils).</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 The following must be determined: the worst case discharge volume of oil for the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the types of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (Groups A or B); and the geographic area(s) in which the facility operates (i.e., operating areas). For a facility handling, storing, or transporting oil from different groups, each group must be calculated separately. Using this information, Table 6 of this appendix must be used to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.2 The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described in section 10.2.2 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.3 The resulting volume shall be used to identify an oil spill removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 A response plan must identify response resources with fire fighting capability appropriate for the risk of fire and explosion at the facility from the discharge or threat of discharge of oil. The owner or operator of a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group A or B oils that does not have adequate fire fighting resources located at the facility or that cannot rely on sufficient local fire fighting resources must identify adequate fire fighting resources. The facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 112.2, the availability of these resources. The response plan must also identify an individual to work with the fire department for Group A or B oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained fire fighting resources are available within a reasonable response time to a worst case scenario. The individual may be the qualified individual identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 The following is an example of the procedure described in sections 10.2 and 10.3 of this appendix. A facility with a 37.04 million gallon (881,904 barrel) capacity of several types of vegetable oils is located in the Inland Operating Area. The vegetable oil with the highest specific gravity stored at the facility is soybean oil (specific gravity 0.922, Group B vegetable oil). The facility has ten aboveground oil storage tanks with a combined total capacity of 18 million gallons (428,571 barrels) and without secondary containment. The remaining facility tanks are inside secondary containment structures. The largest aboveground oil storage tank (3 million gallons or 71,428 barrels) has its own secondary containment.

This will require response resources capable of containing and collecting up to 36,000 gallons of oil or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. All equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in Table 1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 A facility owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily recovery capacity required on-scene. This temporary storage capacity may be reduced if a facility owner or operator can demonstrate by waste stream analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, ability to decant waste, or the availability of alternative temporary storage or disposal locations will reduce the overall volume of oily material storage.</p><p class="depth0">12.3 A facility owner or operator shall ensure that response planning includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered oil products.

This appendix further describes the required elements in Sec. 112.20(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Response plans must be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional office. Figure F-1 of this Appendix lists each EPA Regional office and the address where owners or operators must submit their response plans. Those facilities deemed by the Regional Administrator (RA) to pose a threat of significant and substantial harm to the environment will have their plans reviewed and approved by EPA. In certain cases, information required in the model response plan is similar to information currently maintained in the facility's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan as required by 40 CFR 112.3. In these cases, owners or operators may reproduce the information and include a photocopy in the response plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A complex may develop a single response plan with a set of core elements for all regulating agencies and separate sections for the non-transportation-related and transportation-related components, as described in Sec. 112.20(h). Owners or operators of large facilities that handle, store, or transport oil at more than one geographically distinct location (e.g., oil storage areas at opposite ends of a single, continuous parcel of property) shall, as appropriate, develop separate sections of the response plan for each storage area.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MR92.015</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Emergency Response Action Plan</p><p class="depth0">Several sections of the response plan shall be co-located for easy access by response personnel during an actual emergency or oil discharge. This collection of sections shall be called the Emergency Response Action Plan. The Agency intends that the Action Plan contain only as much information as is necessary to combat the discharge and be arranged so response actions are not delayed. The Action Plan may be arranged in a number of ways. For example, the sections of the Emergency Response Action Plan may be photocopies or condensed versions of the

forms included in the associated sections of the response plan. Each Emergency Response Action Plan section may be tabbed for quick reference. The Action Plan shall be maintained in the front of the same binder that contains the complete response plan or it shall be contained in a separate binder. In the latter case, both binders shall be kept together so that the entire plan can be accessed by the qualified individual and appropriate spill response personnel. The Emergency Response Action Plan shall be made up of the following sections:
1. Qualified Individual Information (Section 1.2) partial2. Emergency Notification Phone List (Section 1.3.1) partial3. Spill Response Notification Form (Section 1.3.1) partial4.

Include degrees, minutes, and seconds of the main entrance of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.3 Wellhead Protection Area: Indicate if the facility is located in or drains into a wellhead protection area as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986 (SDWA). \1\ The response plan requirements in the Wellhead Protection Program are outlined by the State or Territory in which the facility resides.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ A wellhead protection area is defined as the surface and subsurface area surrounding a water well or wellfield, supplying a public water system, through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reach such water well or wellfield. For further information regarding State and territory protection programs, facility owners or operators may contact the SDWA Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1.2.4 Owner/operator: Write the name of the company or person operating the facility and the name of the person or company that owns the facility, if the two are different. List the address of the owner, if the two are different.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.5 Qualified Individual: Write the name of the qualified individual for the entire facility. If more than one person is listed, each individual indicated in this section shall have full authority to implement the facility response plan. For each individual, list: name, position, home and work addresses (street addresses, not P.O. boxes), emergency phone number, and specific response training experience.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.6 Date of Oil Storage Start-up: Enter the year which the present facility first started storing oil.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.7 Current Operation: Briefly describe the facility's operations and include the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.8 Dates and Type of Substantial Expansion: Include information on expansions that have occurred at the facility. Examples of such expansions include, but are not limited to: Throughput expansion, addition of a product line, change of a product line, and installation of additional oil storage capacity. The data provided shall include all facility historical information and detail the expansion of the facility. An example of substantial expansion is any material alteration of the facility which causes the owner or operator of the facility to re-evaluate and increase the response equipment necessary to adequately respond to a worst case discharge from the facility.Date of Last Update: ------</p><p class="depth0">Facility Information Form

The Emergency Response Information section of the plan must include the following components:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The information provided in the Emergency Notification Phone List in section 1.3.1 identifies and prioritizes the names and phone numbers of the organizations and personnel that need to be notified immediately in the event of an emergency. This section shall include all the appropriate phone numbers for the facility. These numbers must be verified each time the plan is updated. The contact list must be accessible to all facility employees to ensure that, in case of a discharge, any employee on site could immediately notify the appropriate parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Spill Response Notification Form in section 1.3.1 creates a checklist of information that shall be provided to the National Response Center (NRC) and other response personnel. All information on this checklist must be known at the time of notification, or be in the process of being collected. This notification form is based on a similar form used by the NRC. Note: Do not delay spill notification to collect the information on the list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 1.3.2 provides a description of the facility's list of emergency response equipment and location of the response equipment. When appropriate, the amount of oil that emergency response equipment can handle and any limitations (e.g., launching sites) must be described.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 1.3.3 provides information regarding response equipment tests and deployment drills. Response equipment deployment exercises shall be conducted to ensure that response equipment is operational and the personnel who would operate the equipment in a spill response are capable of deploying and operating it. Only a representative sample of each type of response equipment needs to be deployed and operated, as long as the remainder is properly maintained. If appropriate, testing of response equipment may be conducted while it is being deployed. Facilities without facility-owned response equipment must ensure that the oil spill removal organization that is identified in the response plan to provide this response equipment certifies that the deployment exercises have been met. Refer to the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Guidelines (see appendix E to this part, section 13, for availability), which satisfy Oil Pollution Act (OPA) response exercise requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 1.3.4 lists the facility response personnel, including those employed by the facility and those under contract to the facility for response activities, the amount of time needed for personnel to respond, their responsibility in the case of an emergency, and their level of response training. Three different forms are included in this section. The Emergency Response Personnel List shall be composed of all personnel employed by the facility whose duties involve responding to emergencies, including oil discharges, even when they are not physically present at the site. An example of this type of person would be the Building Engineer-in-Charge or Plant Fire Chief. The second form is a list of the Emergency Response Contractors (both primary and secondary) retained by the facility. Any changes in contractor status must be reflected in updates to the response plan. Evidence of contracts with response contractors shall be included in this section so that the availability of resources can be verified. The last form is the Facility Response Team List, which shall be composed of both emergency response personnel (referenced by job title/position) and emergency response contractors, included in one of the two lists described above, that will respond immediately upon discovery of an oil discharge or other emergency (i.e., the first people to respond). These are to be persons normally on the facility premises or primary response contractors. Examples of these personnel would be the Facility Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Spill Team 1, Facility Fire Engine Company 1, Production Supervisor, or Transfer Supervisor. Company personnel must be able to respond immediately and adequately if contractor support is not available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Section 1.3.5 lists factors that must, as appropriate, be considered when preparing an evacuation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Section 1.3.6 references the responsibilities of the qualified individual for the facility in the event of an emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The information provided in the emergency response section will aid in the assessment of the facility's ability to respond to a worst case discharge and will identify additional assistance that may be needed. In addition, the facility owner or operator may want to produce a wallet-size card containing a checklist of the immediate response and notification steps to be taken in the event of an oil discharge.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.1 Notification

When developing evacuation plans, consideration must be given to the following factors, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Location of stored materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hazard imposed by discharged material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Discharge flow direction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prevailing wind direction and speed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Water currents, tides, or wave conditions (if applicable);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Arrival route of emergency response personnel and response equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Evacuation routes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Alternative routes of evacuation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Transportation of injured personnel to nearest emergency medical facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Location of alarm/notification systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The need for a centralized check-in area for evacuation validation (roll call);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Selection of a mitigation command center; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Location of shelter at the facility as an alternative to evacuation.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.5.2 One resource that may be helpful to owners or operators in preparing this section of the response plan is The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and EPA. The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures is available from: FEMA , Publication Office, 500 C. Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-3484.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.5.3 As specified in Sec. 112.20(h)(1)(vi), the facility owner or operator must reference existing community evacuation plans, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.6 Qualified Individual's Duties</p><p class="depth0">The duties of the designated qualified individual are specified in Sec. 112.20(h)(3)(ix). The qualified individual's duties must be described and be consistent with the minimum requirements in Sec. 112.20(h)(3)(ix). In addition, the qualified individual must be identified with the Facility Information in section 1.2 of the response plan.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Hazard Evaluation</p><p class="depth0">This section requires the facility owner or operator to examine the facility's operations closely and to predict where discharges could occur. Hazard evaluation is a widely used industry practice that allows facility owners or operators to develop a complete understanding of potential hazards and the response actions necessary to address these hazards. The Handbook of Chemical Hazard Analysis Procedures, prepared by the EPA, DOT, and the FEMA and the Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning Guide (NRT-1), prepared by the National Response Team are good references for conducting a hazard analysis. Hazard identification and evaluation will assist facility owners or operators in planning for potential discharges, thereby reducing the severity of discharge impacts that may occur in the future. The evaluation also may help the operator identify and correct potential sources of discharges. In addition, special hazards to workers and emergency response personnel's health and safety shall be evaluated, as well as the facility's oil spill history.</p><p class="depth0">1.4.1 Hazard Identification</p><p class="depth0">The Tank and Surface Impoundment (SI) forms, or their equivalent, that are part of this section must be completed according to the directions below. (``Surface Impoundment'' means a facility or part of a facility which is a natural topographic depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes or wastes containing free liquids, and which is not an injection well or a seepage facility.) Similar worksheets, or their equivalent, must be developed for any other type of storage containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> List each tank at the facility with a separate and distinct identifier. Begin aboveground tank identifiers with an ``A'' and belowground tank identifiers with a ``B'', or submit multiple sheets with the aboveground tanks and belowground tanks on separate sheets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use gallons for the maximum capacity of a tank; and use square feet for the area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Using the appropriate identifiers and the following instructions, fill in the appropriate forms:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tank or SI number--Using the aforementioned identifiers (A or B) or multiple reporting sheets, identify each tank or SI at the facility that stores oil or hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Substance Stored--For each tank or SI identified, record the material that is stored therein.

If the tank has been refabricated, the year that the latest refabrication was completed must be recorded in parentheses next to the year installed. For

each SI, record the surface area of the impoundment and the year it went into service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Maximum Capacity--Record the operational maximum capacity for each tank and SI. If the maximum capacity varies with the season, record the upper and lower limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Failure/Cause--Record the cause and date of any tank or SI failure which has resulted in a loss of tank or SI contents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Using the numbers from the tank and SI forms, label a schematic drawing of the facility.

Estimate the volume of material involved in transfer operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Day-to-day operations that may present a risk of discharging oil or releasing a hazardous substance. These activities include scheduled venting, piping repair or replacement, valve maintenance, transfer of tank contents from one tank to another, etc. (not including transportation-related activities). Estimate the volume of material involved in these operations, if the exact volume cannot be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The secondary containment volume associated with each tank and/or transfer point at the facility. The numbering scheme developed on the tables, or an equivalent system, must be used to identify each containment area. Capacities must be listed for each individual unit (tanks, slumps, drainage traps, and ponds), as well as the facility total.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Normal daily throughput for the facility

A multi-level planning approach has been chosen because the response actions to a discharge (i.e., necessary response equipment, products, and personnel) are dependent on the magnitude of the discharge. Planning for lesser discharges is necessary because the nature of the response may be qualitatively different depending on the quantity of the discharge. The facility owner or operator shall discuss the potential direction of the discharge pathway.</p><p class="depth0">1.5.1 Small and Medium Discharges</p><p class="depth0">1.5.1.1 To address multi-level planning requirements, the owner or operator must consider types of facility-specific discharge scenarios that may contribute to a small or medium discharge.

Worksheets for production and non-production facility owners or operators to use when calculating worst case discharge are presented in appendix D to this part. When planning for the worst case discharge response, all of the aforementioned factors listed in the small and medium discharge section of the response plan shall be addressed.</p><p class="depth0">1.5.2.2 For onshore storage facilities and production facilities, permanently manifolded oil storage tanks are defined as tanks that are designed, installed, and/or operated in such a manner that the multiple tanks function as one storage unit (i.e., multiple tank volumes are equalized). In this section of the response plan, owners or operators must provide evidence that oil storage tanks with common piping or piping systems are not operated as one unit. If such evidence is provided and is acceptable to the RA, the worst case discharge volume shall be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifold tanks or the oil storage capacity of the largest single oil storage tank within the secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that function as one storage unit, the worst case discharge shall be based on the combined oil storage capacity of all manifolded tanks or the oil storage capacity of the largest single tank within a secondary containment area, whichever is greater. For purposes of the worst case discharge calculation, permanently manifolded oil storage tanks that are separated by internal divisions for each tank are considered to be single tanks and individual manifolded tank volumes are not combined.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 Discharge Detection Systems</p><p class="depth0">In this section, the facility owner or operator shall provide a detailed description of the procedures and equipment used to detect discharges. A section on discharge detection by personnel and a discussion of automated discharge detection, if applicable, shall be included for both regular operations and after hours operations.

This section shall include the identification of response resources for small, medium, and worst case discharges; disposal plans; and containment and drainage planning. A list of those personnel who would be involved in the cleanup shall be identified. Procedures that the facility will use, where appropriate or necessary, to update their plan after an oil discharge event and the time frame to update the plan must be described.</p><p class="depth0">1.7.1 Response Resources for Small, Medium, and Worst Case Discharages</p><p class="depth0">1.7.1.1 Once the discharge scenarios have been identified in section 1.5 of the response plan, the facility owner or operator shall identify and describe implementation of the response actions.
