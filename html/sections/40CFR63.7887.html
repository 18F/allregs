                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must control HAP emissions from equipment leaks from each  equipment component that is part of the affected source by implementing  leak detection and control measures according to the standards specified  in Sec. Sec. 63.7920 through 63.7922 unless you elect to meet the  requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the affected equipment leak source is also subject to another  subpart in 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you may control emissions  of the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart from the affected equipment  leak source in compliance with the standards specified in the other  applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable  emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other  subpart (e.g., you implement leak detection and control measures to  reduce HAP emissions as specified by the applicable subpart). This  provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from  the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the  other applicable subpart.
