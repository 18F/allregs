                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The employer must ensure that, prior to operating any equipment covered under subpart CC, the person is operating the equipment during a training period in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, or the operator is qualified or certified to operate the equipment in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When a non-military government entity issues operator licenses for equipment covered under subpart CC, and that government licensing program meets the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (j) of this section, the equipment operator must either be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Licensed by that government entity for operation of equipment within that entity's jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> qualified in compliance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not applicable, the certification or qualification must comply with one of the options in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions: Operator qualification or certification under this section is not required for operators of derricks (see Sec. 1926.1436), sideboom cranes (see Sec. 1926.1440), or equipment with a maximum manufacturer-rated hoisting/lifting capacity of 2,000 pounds or less (see Sec. 1926.1441).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whenever operator qualification or certification is required under Sec. 1926.1427, the employer must provide the qualification or certification at no

cost to operators who are employed by the employer on November 8, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Option (1): Certification by an accredited crane operator testing organization. (1) For a testing organization to be considered accredited to certify operators under this subpart, it must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency based on that agency's determination that industry recognized criteria for written testing materials, practical examinations, test administration, grading, facilities/equipment and personnel have been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Administer written and practical tests that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Assess the operator applicant regarding, at a minimum, the knowledge and skills listed in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Provide different levels of certification based on equipment capacity and type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Have procedures for operators to re-apply and be re-tested in the event an operator applicant fails a test or is decertified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Have testing procedures for re-certification designed to ensure that the operator continues to meet the technical knowledge and skills requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Have its accreditation reviewed by the nationally recognized accrediting agency at least every three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An operator will be deemed qualified to operate a particular piece of equipment if the operator is certified under paragraph (b) of this section for that type and capacity of equipment or for higher-capacity equipment of that type. If no accredited testing agency offers certification examinations for a particular type and/or capacity of equipment, an operator will be deemed qualified to operate that equipment if the operator has been certified for the type/capacity that is most similar to that equipment and for which a certification examination is available. The operator's certificate must state the type/capacity of equipment for which the operator is certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A certification issued under this option is portable and meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A certification issued under this paragraph is valid for 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Option (2): Qualification by an audited employer program. The employer's qualification of its employee must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The written and practical tests must be either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Developed by an accredited crane operator testing organization (see paragraph (b) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approved by an auditor in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The auditor is certified to evaluate such tests by an accredited crane operator testing organization (see paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The auditor is not an employee of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The approval must be based on the auditor's determination that the written and practical tests meet nationally recognized test development criteria and are valid and reliable in assessing the operator applicants regarding, at a minimum, the knowledge and skills listed in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The audit must be conducted in accordance with nationally recognized auditing standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Administration of tests. (i) The written and practical tests must be administered under circumstances approved by the auditor as meeting nationally recognized test administration standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The auditor must be certified to evaluate the administration of the written and practical tests by an accredited crane operator testing organization (see paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The auditor must not be an employee of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The audit must be conducted in accordance with nationally recognized auditing standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The employer program must be audited within 3 months of the beginning of the program and at least every 3 years thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The employer program must have testing procedures for re-qualification designed to ensure that the operator continues to meet the technical knowledge and skills requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.

Such a qualification meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section only where the operator is employed by (and operating the equipment for) the employer that issued the qualification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Valid for 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Option (3): Qualification by the U.S. military. (1) For purposes of this section, an operator who is an employee of the U.S. military is considered qualified if he/she has a current operator qualification issued by the U.S. military for operation of the equipment.

(i) The requirements for obtaining the license include an assessment, by written and practical tests, of the operator applicant regarding, at a minimum, the knowledge and skills listed in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The testing meets industry recognized criteria for written testing materials, practical examinations, test administration, grading, facilities/equipment and personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The government authority that oversees the licensing department/office, has determined that the requirements in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The licensing department/office has testing procedures for re-licensing designed to ensure that the operator continues to meet the technical knowledge and skills requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A license issued by a government accredited crane operator testing organization that meets the requirements of this option:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Meets the operator qualification requirements of this section for operation of equipment only within the jurisdiction of the government entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is valid for the period of time stipulated by the licensing department/office, but no longer than 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Pre-qualification/certification training period.
