                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual registration statement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under section  6057(a), the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g))  of an employee retirement benefit plan must file with the Internal  Revenue Service information relating to each plan participant who  separates from service covered by the plan and is entitled to a deferred  vested retirement benefit under the plan, but is not paid this  retirement benefit. Plans subject to this filing requirement are  described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Subparagraph (4)  describes how the information is to be filed with the Internal Revenue  Service. In the case of a plan to which only one employer contributes,  the time for filing the information with respect to each separated  participant is described in subparagraph (5). In the case of a plan to  which more than one employer contributes the time for filing the  information with respect to a participant is described in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section also provides  other rules applicable only to plans to which more than one employer  contributes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deferred vested retirement benefit. For purposes of this  section, a plan   participant's deferred retirement benefit is considered a vested benefit  if it is vested under the terms of the plan at the close of the plan  year described in paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(4) of this section (whichever  is applicable) for which information relating to any deferred vested  retirement benefit of the participant must be filed. A participant's  deferred retirement benefit need not be a nonforfeitable benefit within  the meaning of section 411(a) for the filing requirements described in  this section to apply. Accordingly, information relating to a  participant's deferred vested retirement benefit must be filed as  required by this section notwithstanding that the benefit is subject to  forfeiture by reason of an event or condition occurring subsequent to  the close of the plan year described in paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(4) of  this section (whichever is applicable) for which information relating to  any deferred vested retirement benefit of the participant must be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Plans subject to filing requirement. The term ``employee  retirement benefit plan'' means a plan to which the vesting standards of  section 203 of part 2 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 854) apply for any day  in the plan year. (For purposes of this section, ``plan year'' means the  plan year as determined for purposes of the annual return required by  section 6058(a)). Accordingly, a plan need not be a qualified plan  within the meaning of section 401(a) to be subject to these filing  requirements. A plan to which more than one employer contributes must  file the report of deferred vested retirement benefits described in this  section, but see paragraph (b) of this section for special rules  applicable to such a plan. The filing requirements described in this  section and Sec. 301.6057-2 (relating to notification of change in plan  status) do not apply to a governmental or church plan described in  section 414 (d) or (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Filing requirements. Information relating to the deferred vested  retirement benefit of a plan participant must be filed on schedule SSA  as an attachment to the Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan  (form 5500 series). Schedule SSA shall be filed on behalf of an employee  retirement benefit plan for each plan year for which information  relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant  is filed under paragraph (a)(5) or (b)(2) of this section. There shall  be filed on schedule SSA the name and social security number of the  participant, a description of the nature, form, and amount of the  deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled,  and such other information as is required by section 6057(a) or schedule  SSA and the accompanying instructions. The form of the benefit reported  on schedule SSA shall be the normal form of benefit under the plan, or,  if the plan administrator (within the meaning of section 414(g))  considers it more appropriate, any other form of benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Time for reporting deferred vested retirement benefit--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. In the case of a plan to which only one employer contributes,  information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan  participant must be filed no later than on the schedule SSA filed for  the plan year following the plan year within which the participant  separates from service covered by the plan. Information relating to a  separated participant may, at the option of the plan administrator, be  reported earlier (that is, on the schedule SSA filed for the plan year  in which the participant separates from service covered by the plan).  For purposes of this paragraph a participant is not considered to  separate from service covered by the plan solely because the participant  incurs a break in service under the plan. In addition, for purposes of  this paragraph, in the case of a plan which uses the elapsed time method  described in Department of Labor regulations for crediting service for  benefit accrual purposes, a participant is considered to separate from  service covered by the plan on the date the participant severs from  service covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding subdivision (i), no information  relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a separated  participant is required to be filed on schedule SSA if, before the date  such schedule SSA is required to be filed (including any extension of   time for filing granted pursuant to section 6081), the participant (A)  is paid some or all of the deferred vested retirement benefit under the  plan, (B) returns to service covered by the plan, or (C) forfeits all of  the deferred vested retirement benefit under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plans to which more than one employer contributes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Application. Section 6057 and this section apply to a plan to which more  than one employer contributes with the modifications set forth in this  paragraph. For purposes of section 6057 and this section, whether or not  more than one employer contributes to a plan shall be determined by the  number of employers who are required to contribute to the plan. Thus,  for example, this paragraph applies to plans maintained by more than one  employer which are collectively bargained as described in section  413(a), multiple-employer plans described in section 413(c) and the  regulations thereunder, multiemployer plans described in section 414(f),  and plans adopted by more than one employer of certain controlled and  common control groups described in section 414 (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time for reporting deferred vested retirement benefit--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. In the case of a plan to which more than one employer  contributes, information relating to the deferred vested retirement  benefit of a plan participant must be filed no later than on the  schedule SSA filed for the plan year within which the participant  completes the second of two consecutive one-year breaks in service (as  defined in the plan for vesting percentage purposes) in service  computation periods (as defined in the plan for vesting percentage  purposes) which begin after December 31, 1974. At the option of the plan  administrator, information relating to a participant's deferred vested  retirement benefit may be filed earlier (that is, on the schedule SSA  filed for the plan year in which the participant incurs the first one- year break in service or, in the case of a separated participant, on the  schedule SSA filed for the plan year in which the participant separates  from service).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules--For purposes of this subparagraph (1)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For the definition of the term ``1-year break in service'' in  the case of a plan which uses the elapsed time method described in  Department of Labor Regulations for crediting service for vesting  percentage purposes, see Sec. 1.411(a)-6(c)(2).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a plan which does not define the term ``1-year  break in service'' for vesting percentage purposes, a plan participant  shall be deemed to incur a 1-year break in service under the plan in any  plan year within which the participant does not complete more than 500  hours of service covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Transitional rule. Notwithstanding subdivision (i), if the  second consecutive 1-year break in service described in subdivision (i)  is incurred in a plan year beginning before January 1, 1978, information  relating to the participant's deferred vested retirement benefit is not  required to be filed earlier than on the schedule SSA filed for the  first plan year beginning after December 31, 1977.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding subdivision (i) or (iii) of this  subparagraph, no information relating to a participant's deferred vested  retirement benefit is required to be filed on schedule SSA if, before  the date such schedule SSA is required to be filed (including any  extension of time for filing granted pursuant to section 6081), the  participant (A) is paid some or all of the deferred vested retirement  benefit under the plan, (B) accrues additional retirement benefits under  the plan, or (C) forfeits all of the deferred vested retirement benefit  under the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information relating to deferred vested retirement benefit--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Incomplete records. Section 6057(a) and paragraph (a)(4) of this section  require the filing on schedule SSA of a description of the deferred  vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled. If the  plan administrator of a plan to which more than one employer contributes  maintains records of a participant's service covered by the plan which  are incomplete as of the close of the plan year with respect to which  the plan administrator files information relating to the participant on  schedule SSA, the plan administrator may elect to file the information  required by schedule   SSA based only upon these incomplete records. The plan administrator is  not required, for purposes of completing schedule SSA, to compile from  sources other than such records a complete record of a participant's  years of service covered by the plan. Similarly, if retirement benefits  under the plan are determined by taking into account a participant's  service with an employer which is not service covered by the plan, but  the plan administrator maintains records only with respect to periods of  service covered by the plan, the plan administrator may complete  schedule SSA taking into account only the participant's period of  service covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inability to determine correct amount of participant's deferred  vested retirement benefit. If the amount of a participant's deferred  vested retirement benefit which is filed on schedule SSA is computed on  the basis of plan records maintained by the plan administrator which--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Are incomplete with respect to the participant's service covered  by the plan (as described in subdivision (i)), or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fail to account for the participant's service not covered by the  plan which is relevant to a determination of the participant's deferred  vested retirement benefit under the plan (as described in subdivision  (i)),  then the plan administrator must indicate on schedule SSA that the  amount of the deferred vested retirement benefit shown therein may be  other than that to which the participant is actually entitled because  the amount is based upon incomplete records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> does  not apply in a case in which it can be determined from plan records  maintained by the plan administrator that the participant is vested in a  deferred retirement benefit. Subdivision (ii), however, may apply in  such a case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Voluntary filing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The plan administrator of an  employee retirement benefit plan described in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section, or any other employee retirement benefit plan (including a  governmental or church plan), may at its option, file on schedule SSA  information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of any  plan participant who separates at any time from service covered by the  plan, including plan participants who separate from service in plan  years beginning before 1976.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deleting previously filed information. If, after information  relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant  is filed on schedule SSA, the plan participant--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is paid some or all of the deferred vested retirement benefit  under the plan, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Forfeits all of the deferred vested retirement benefit under  the plan, the plan administrator may, at its option, file on schedule  SSA (or such other form as may be provided for this purpose) the name  and social security number of the participant with the notation that  information previously filed relating to the participant's deferred  vested retirement benefit should be deleted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing incident to cessation of payment of benefits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. As described in this section, no information relating to the  deferred vested retirement benefit of a plan participant is required to  be filed on schedule SSA if before the date such schedule SSA is  required to be filed, some of the deferred vested retirement benefit is  paid   to the participant, and information relating to a participant's deferred  vested retirement benefit which was previously filed on schedule SSA may  be deleted if the participant is paid some of the deferred vested  retirement benefit. If payment of the deferred vested retirement benefit  ceases before all of the benefit to which the participant is entitled is  paid to the participant, information relating to the deferred vested  retirement benefit to which the participant remains entitled shall be  filed on the schedule SSA filed for the plan year following the last  plan year within which a portion of the benefit is paid to the  participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph,  no information relating to the deferred vested retirement benefit to  which the participant remains entitled is required to be filed on  schedule SSA if, before the date such schedule SSA is required to be  filed (including any extension of time for filing granted pursuant to  section 6081), the participant (i) returns to service covered by the  plan, (ii) accrues additional retirement benefits under the plan, or  (iii) forfeits the benefit under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Individual statement to participant. The plan administrator of  an employee retirement benefit plan defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section must provide each participant with respect to whom information  is required to be filed on schedule SSA a statement describing the  deferred vested retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled.  The description provided the participant must include the information  filed with respect to the participant on schedule SSA. The statement is  to be delivered to the participant or forwarded to the participant's  last known address no later than the date on which any schedule SSA  reporting information with respect to the participant is required to be  filed (including any extension of time for filing granted pursuant to  section 6081).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Penalties. For amounts imposed in the case of failure to file  the report of deferred vested retirement benefits required by section  6057(a) and paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, see section  6652(e)(1). For the penalty relating to a failure to provide the  participant the individual statement of deferred vested retirement  benefit required by section 6057(e) and paragraph (e) of this section,  see section 6690.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plans to which only one employer  contributes. In the case of a plan to which only one employer  contributes, this section is effective for plan years beginning after  December 31, 1975, and with respect to a participant who separates from  service covered by the plan in plan years beginning after that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plans to which more than one employer contributes. In the case  of a plan to which more than one employer contributes, this section is  effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1977, and with  respect to a participant who completes two consecutive 1-year breaks in  service under the plan in service computation periods beginning after  December 31, 1974.
