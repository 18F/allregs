The data must be submitted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directly in the NADA, by a sponsor; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To an MF that a sponsor may then reference in its NADA with written consent of the MF holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What will be stated in the published approval for a new animal drug intended for use in free-choice feed? The approval of a new animal drug intended for use in free-choice feed, as published in this subchapter, will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The formula and/or specifications of the free-choice medicated feed, where the owner of this information requests such publication, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the approval has been granted for a proprietary formula and/or specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When is a medicated feed mill license required for the manufacture of a free-choice medicated feed?
