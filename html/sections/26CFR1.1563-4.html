For each month during the taxable year, a nonexempt  individual must have minimum essential coverage or pay the shared  responsibility payment. For a month, a nonexempt individual is an  individual in existence for the entire month who is not an exempt  individual described in Sec. 1.5000A-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coverage under minimum essential coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An  individual has minimum essential coverage for a   month in which the individual is enrolled in and entitled to receive  benefits under a program or plan identified as minimum essential  coverage in Sec. 1.5000A-2 for at least one day in the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for United States citizens or residents residing  outside the United States or residents of territories.

A  taxpayer is liable for the shared responsibility payment for a month for  which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer is a nonexempt individual without minimum essential  coverage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A nonexempt individual for whom the taxpayer is liable under  paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section does not have minimum  essential coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for dependents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For a month when a  nonexempt individual does not have minimum essential coverage, if the  nonexempt individual is a dependent (as defined in section 152) of  another individual for the other individual's taxable year including  that month, the other individual is liable for the shared responsibility  payment attributable to the dependent's lack of coverage. An individual  is a dependent of a taxpayer for a taxable year if the individual  satisfies the definition of dependent under section 152, regardless of  whether the taxpayer claims the individual as a dependent on a Federal  income tax return for the taxable year. If an individual may be claimed  as a dependent by more than one taxpayer in the same calendar year, the  taxpayer who properly claims the individual as a dependent for the  taxable year is liable for the shared responsibility payment  attributable to the individual. If more than one taxpayer may claim an  individual as a dependent in the same calendar year but no one claims  the individual as a dependent, the taxpayer with priority under the  rules of section 152 to claim the individual as a dependent is liable  for the shared responsibility payment for the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules for dependents adopted or placed in foster care  during the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Taxpayers adopting an individual. If a  taxpayer adopts a nonexempt dependent (or accepts a nonexempt dependent  who is an eligible foster child as defined in section 152(f)(1)(C))  during the taxable year and is otherwise liable for the nonexempt  dependent under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer is  liable under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the nonexempt  dependent only for the full months in the taxable year that follow the  month in which the adoption or acceptance occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxpayers placing an individual for adoption. If a taxpayer who  is otherwise liable for a nonexempt dependent under paragraph (c)(2)(i)  of this section places (or, by operation of law, must place) the  nonexempt dependent for adoption or foster care during the taxable year,  the taxpayer is liable under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the  nonexempt dependent only for the full months in the taxable year that  precede the month in which the adoption or foster care placement occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).

Prior to  the adoption, G resides with H, an unmarried individual, with H  providing all of G's support. For 2016 G meets all requirements under  section 152 to be E and F's dependent, and not H's dependent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, E and F are not liable  for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for January  through May of 2016, but are liable for a shared responsibility payment  attributable to G, if any, for June through December of 2016. H is not  liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for any  month in 2016, because G is not H's dependent for 2016 under section  152.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are  the same as Example 1, except the legal adoption occurs on August 15,  2016, and, for 2016, G meets all requirements under section 152 to be  H's dependent, and not E and F's dependent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, H is liable for a  shared responsibility payment attributable to G, if any, for January  through July of 2016, but is not liable for a shared responsibility  payment attributable to G for August through December of 2016. E and F  are not liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for  any month in 2016, because G is not E and F's dependent for 2016 under  section 152.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Liability of individuals filing a joint return.

Short coverage gap. Taxpayer D has minimum essential  coverage in 2016 from January 1 through March 2.

Under Sec. 1.5000A-1(b), for  purposes of section 5000A, D has minimum essential coverage for January,  February, March, and June through December. D's continuous period  without coverage is 2 months, April and May. April and May constitute a  short coverage gap under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Continuous period of 3 months or more. The facts are the  same as in Example 1, except D's coverage is not effective until July 1.  D's continuous period without coverage is 3 months, April, May, and  June. Under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, April, May, and June  are not included in a short coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Short coverage gap following exempt period. Taxpayer E is  incarcerated from January 1 through June 2. E enrolls in an eligible  employer-sponsored plan effective September 15. Under paragraph (d) of  this section, E is exempt for the period January through June. Under  paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, E is treated as having minimum  essential coverage for this period, and E's continuous period without  minimum essential coverage is 2 months, July and August. July and August  constitute a short coverage gap under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Continuous period covering more than one taxable year.  Taxpayer F, an unmarried individual with no dependents, has minimum  essential coverage for the period January 1 through October 15, 2016. F  is without coverage until February 15, 2017. F files his Federal income  tax return for 2016 on March 10, 2017. Under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of  this section, November and December of 2016 are treated as a short  coverage gap. However, November and December of 2016 are included in the  continuous period that includes January 2017. The continuous period for  2017 is not less than 3 months and, therefore, January is not a part of  a short coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Enrollment following loss of coverage. The facts are the  same as in Example 4 except F loses coverage on June 15, 2017. F enrolls  in minimum essential coverage effective September 15, 2017. The  continuous period without minimum essential coverage in July and August  of 2017 is two months and, therefore, is a short coverage gap. Because  January 2017 was not part of a short coverage gap, the earliest short  coverage gap occurring in 2017 is the gap that includes July and August.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in  Example 5 except F has minimum essential coverage for November 2016.  Under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, December 2016 is treated as  a short coverage gap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> December 2016 is included in the continuous period that  includes January 2017. This continuous period is two months and,  therefore, January 2017 is the earliest month in 2017 that is included  in a short coverage gap. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section,  the exemption under this paragraph (j) applies only to January 2017.  Thus, the continuous period without minimum essential coverage in July  and August of 2017 is not a short coverage gap.
