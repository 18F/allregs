Sec. 25.211(d) and 25.212(d), and frequency coordination has been satisfactorily completed. The use of smaller antennas or non-consistent power levels require the filing of an initial lead application (Sec. 25.115(c)(2)) that includes all technical analyses required to demonstrate that unacceptable interference will not be caused to any and all affected adjacent satellite operators by the operation of the non-conforming earth station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> VSAT networks operating in the 12/14 GHz band.
