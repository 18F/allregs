Any regulated entity or the Office of  Finance may submit a complaint in accordance with procedures established  by the Ombudsman.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Matters subject to complaint. A regulated entity or the Office  of Finance may submit a complaint regarding any matter relating to the  regulation and supervision of a regulated entity or the Office of  Finance by FHFA that is not subject to appeal or in litigation,  arbitration, or mediation. The Ombudsman may further define what matters  are subject to complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Any regulated entity or the Office of  Finance may submit an appeal in accordance with procedures established  by the Ombudsman.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Matters subject to appeal. A regulated entity or the Office of  Finance may submit an appeal regarding any final, written regulatory or  supervisory conclusion, decision, or examination rating by FHFA. The  Ombudsman may   further define what matters are subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Matters not subject to appeal. Matters for which there is an  existing avenue of appeal or for which there is another forum for  appeal; non-final decisions or conclusions; and matters in ongoing  litigation, arbitration, or mediation, unless there has been a breakdown  in the process, may not be appealed. Matters not subject to appeal  include, but are not limited to, appointments of conservators or  receivers, preliminary examination conclusions, formal enforcement  decisions, formal and informal rulemakings, Freedom of Information Act  appeals, final FHFA decisions subject to judicial review, and matters  within the jurisdiction of the FHFA Inspector General. The Ombudsman may  further define what matters are not subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effect of filing an appeal. An appeal under this section does  not excuse a regulated entity or the Office of Finance from complying  with any regulatory or supervisory decision while the appeal is pending.  However, the Director, upon consideration of a written request, may  waive compliance with a regulatory or supervisory decision during the  pendency of the appeal.</p>
