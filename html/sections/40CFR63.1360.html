If the greatest input to and/or output from a shared storage vessel is the same for two or more process units, including one or more PAI process units, the owner or operator must assign the storage vessel to any one of the PAI process units that meet this condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where a storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The storage vessel in the tank farm is not subject to the provisions of this subpart if the greatest input to or output from the storage vessel is for a non-PAI process unit. The input and output shall be determined among only those process units that share the storage vessel and that do not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for storage vessels in a tank farm excluded in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel in a tank farm if each PAI process unit that receives material from or sends material to the storage vessel has an intervening storage vessel for that material.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, a storage vessel in a tank farm shall be assigned to the PAI process unit that receives the greatest amount of material from or sends the greatest amount of material to the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel. If two or more PAI process units have the same input to or output from the storage vessel in the tank farm, then the storage vessel in the tank farm may be assigned to any one of the PAI process units that meet this condition.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs

(f)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, even if an intervening storage vessel is present, an owner or operator may elect to assign a storage vessel in a tank farm to the PAI process unit that sends the most material to or receives the most material from the storage vessel. If two or more PAI process units have the same input to or output from the storage vessel in the tank farm, then the storage vessel in the tank farm may be assigned to any one of the PAI process units that meet this condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to a process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that the product or raw material entering or leaving the process flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If use varies from year to year, then use for the purposes of this subpart for existing sources shall be based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding June 23, 1999, or if the storage vessel was not in operation during that year, the use shall be based on the expected use in the 5 years after startup. This determination shall be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise specified by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another process unit, or ceasing to receive material from (or send material to) a PAI process unit, or if there is a significant change in the use of the storage vessel, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the ownership determination for the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Designating production of an intermediate as a PAI process unit. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to designate production of any intermediate that does not meet the definition of integral intermediate as a PAI process unit subject to this subpart. Any storage vessel containing the intermediate is assigned to a PAI process unit according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. Any process tank containing the intermediate is part of the process unit used to produce the intermediate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applicability of process units included in a process unit group. An owner or operator may elect to develop process unit groups in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section. For the PAI process units in these process unit groups, the owner or operator may comply with the provisions in overlapping MACT standards, as specified in paragraphs (h)(2) through (4) of this section, as an alternative means of demonstrating compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Develop, revise, and document changes in a process unit group in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initially identify a non-dedicated PAI process unit that is operating on December 23, 2003 or a date after December 23, 2003, and identify all processing equipment that is part of this PAI process unit, based on descriptions in operating scenarios.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add to the group any other non-dedicated PAI and non-dedicated non-PAI process units expected to be operated in the 5 years after the date specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, provided they satisfy the criteria specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.

In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at Sec.  63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed if the owner or operator fails to meet their burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assertion of affirmative defense.

The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions

that were the result of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator, with all necessary supporting documentation, that explains how it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (k)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance report, deviation report, or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.[64 FR 33589, June 23, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 59340, Sept. 20, 2002; 79 FR 17371, Mar. 27, 2014]</p>
