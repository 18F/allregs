                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Non-standard components may be used in the construction of PFDs only if they have been accepted by the Coast Guard in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use Codes. Each non-standard component is assigned a Use Code as indicated in table 164.019-3. Additional Use Codes may be assigned by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for acceptance. The component manufacturer or the recognized laboratory that performs the acceptance testing required by the applicable subpart of this part or part 160 of this chapter must submit, in writing, to the Commandant, a request for acceptance of any non-standard component. The request must include the information, supporting documentation, and samples required by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request must include a statement of the intended use of the component by the PFD manufacturer, and the Use Code(s) for which acceptance is requested. Intended uses must be for one or more of the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outer Envelope Fabric (exterior fabrics on wearable PFDs);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cover Fabric (for throwable PFDs);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inner Envelope Fabric;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Closure (including zippers) or Adjustment Hardware;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Body Strap;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Grab Strap (applies to buoyant cushions only);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Tie Tape;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Reinforcing Tape;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Thread:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Flotation Foam; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Other (specify).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request must include a statement identifying the component in detail and including the unique style, part, or model number, the identification data required by the applicable subpart of this part, and any other manufacturer's identifying data. No two components which differ in any way, e.g., size, material composition, construction, may utilize the same identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The report of a recognized laboratory's test data in accordance with the ``acceptance tests'' required by the applicable subpart of this part or part 160 must be submitted with the request. Each report must include the name of the laboratory and a description of the test equipment and test methods used, and must be signed and dated by an authorized laboratory official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A sample of each component that is being considered must be submitted with the request. Where the lightest and darkest colors are being tested, samples of both colors must be submitted. A one linear yard sample is required in the case of textiles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The request must include a list of all materials used in the construction of the particular component. The list must contain specific identification and quantity of all materials used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For hardware and other mechanical components, the request must include scaled drawings showing details and dimensions of the mechanism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A statement of dimensional and performance tolerances, as appropriate, that will be maintained in production must be submitted with request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The request must include a description of the quality control procedures that will be in effect during production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The request must include a detailed description of the recognized laboratory's procedures for oversight of the manufacturer's program of production quality control, including a description of the laboratory's certification marking(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The request must include any appropriate installation or use guidelines for the component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation of acceptance. When an acceptance is granted, the Commandant provides written notice to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternate requirements. A component that does not meet the requirements of this subchapter is eligible for acceptance if it--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets other requirements prescribed by the Commandant in lieu of or in addition to the requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides at least the same degree of safety as provided by a component that does comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional tests and documentation. The Commandant may prescribe additional tests or request additional documentation, if necessary, to determine the acceptability or suitability of a particular product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Suspension or termination of acceptance.
