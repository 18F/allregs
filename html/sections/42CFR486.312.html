                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary termination of agreement. If an OPO wishes to  terminate its agreement, the OPO must send CMS written notice of its  intention to terminate its agreement and the proposed effective date.  CMS may approve the proposed date, set a different date no later than 6  months after the proposed effective date, or set a date less than 6  months after the proposed effective date if it determines that a  different date would not disrupt services to the service area. If CMS  determines that a designated OPO has ceased to furnish organ procurement  services to its service area, the cessation of services is deemed to  constitute a voluntary termination by the OPO, effective on a date  determined by CMS. CMS will de-certify the OPO as of the effective date  of the voluntary termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Involuntary termination of agreement. During the term of the  agreement, CMS may terminate an agreement with an OPO if the OPO no  longer meets the requirements for certification at Sec. 486.303. CMS  may also terminate an agreement immediately in cases of urgent need,  such as the discovery of unsound medical practices. CMS will de-certify  the OPO as of the effective date of the involuntary termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-renewal of agreement. CMS will not voluntarily renew its  agreement with an OPO if the OPO fails to meet the requirements for  certification at Sec. 486.318, based on findings from the most recent  re-certification cycle, or the other requirements for certification at  Sec. 486.303. CMS will de-certify the OPO as of the ending date of the  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to OPO. Except in cases of urgent need, CMS gives written  notice of de-certification to an OPO at least 90 days before the  effective date of the de-certification. In cases of urgent need, CMS  gives written notice of de-certification to an OPO at least 3 calendar  days prior to the effective date of the de-certification. The notice of  de-certification states the reasons for de-certification and the  effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public notice. Once CMS approves the date for a voluntary  termination, the OPO must provide prompt public notice of the date of  de-certification and such other information as CMS may require through  publication in local newspapers in the service area. In the case of  involuntary termination or non-renewal of an agreement, CMS provides  public notice of the date of de-certification through publication in  local newspapers in the service area. No payment under titles XVIII or  XIX of the Act will be made with respect to organ procurement costs  attributable to the OPO on or after the effective date of de- certification.</p>
