transmitting, except for transmission of signals of distress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a radio communication causes interference to a communication which is already in progress, the interfering station must cease transmitting at the request of either party to the existing communication. As between nondistress traffic seeking to commence use of a frequency, the priority is established under Sec. 80.91.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except in cases of distress, communications between ship stations or between ship and aircraft stations must not interfere with public coast stations. The ship or aircraft stations which cause interference must stop transmitting or change frequency upon the first request of the affected coast station.</p>
