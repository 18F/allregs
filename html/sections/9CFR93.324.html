In  order to qualify for such release, all horses while so detained shall  test negative to an official test for dourine, glanders, equine  piroplasmosis,   equine infectious anemia, \19\ and such other tests that may be required  by the Administrator to determine their freedom from other communicable  diseases. Such horses shall also be subjected to such other inspections  and disinfections deemed necessary by the Administrator, and they shall  be released from quarantine only if found to be free from any  communicable disease upon inspection. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\19\ In view of the fact that official test for dourine and glanders  are run exclusively at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory,  Ames, Iowa, protocols for these tests have not been published and are  therefore not available; copies of ``Protocol for the Complement- Fixation Test for Equine Piroplasmosis'' and ``Protocol for the Immuno- Diffusion (Coggins) Test for Equine Infectious Anemia'' may be obtained  from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary  Services, National Center for Import-Export, 4700 River Road Unit 38,  Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.
