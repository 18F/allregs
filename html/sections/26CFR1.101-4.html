                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 101(d) states the provisions  governing the exclusion from gross income of amounts (other than those  to which section 101(c) applies) received under a life insurance  contract and paid by reason of the death of the insured which are paid  to a beneficiary on a date or dates later than the death of the insured.  However, if the amounts payable as proceeds of life insurance to which  section 101(a)(1) applies cannot in any event exceed the amount payable  at the time of the insured's death, such amounts are fully excludable  from the gross income of the recipient (or recipients) without regard to  the actual time of payment and no further determination need be made  under this section. Section 101(d)(1)(A) provides an exclusion from  gross income of any amount determined by a proration, under applicable  regulations, of ``an amount held by an insurer with respect to any  beneficiary''. The quoted phrase is defined in section 101(d)(2). For  the regulations governing the method of computation of this proration,  see paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section. The prorated amounts are  to be excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary regardless of  the taxable year in which they are actually received (see example (2) of  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 101(d)(1)(B) provides an additional exclusion where  life insurance proceeds are paid to the surviving spouse of an insured.  For purposes of this exclusion, the term ``surviving spouse'' means the  spouse of the insured as of the date of death, including a spouse  legally separated, but not under a decree of absolute divorce (section  101(d)(3)). To the extent that the total payments, under one or more  agreements, made in excess of the amounts determined by proration under  section 101(d)(1)(A) do not exceed $1,000 in the taxable year of  receipt, they shall be excluded from the gross income of the surviving  spouse (whether or not payment of any part of such amounts is guaranteed  by the insurer). Amounts excludable under section 101(d)(1)(B) are not  ``prorated'' amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A surviving spouse elects to receive all of the life  insurance proceeds with respect to one insured, amounting to $150,000,  in ten annual installments of $16,500 each, based on a certain  guaranteed interest rate. The prorated amount is $15,000 ($150,000/10).  As the second payment, the insurer pays $17,850, which exceeds the  guaranteed payment by $1,350 as the result of earnings of the insurer in  excess of those required to pay the guaranteed installments. The  surviving spouse shall include $1,850 in gross income and exclude  $16,000--determined in the following manner:  Fixed payment (including guaranteed interest).................   $16,500 Excess interest...............................................     1,350</p><p class="depth3">---------</p><p class="depth3">Total payment.............................................    17,850 Prorated amount...............................................    15,000</p><p class="depth3">---------</p><p class="depth3">Excess over prorated amount...............................     2,850 Annual excess over prorated amount excludable under section        1,000</p><p class="depth3">101(d)(1)(B).................................................</p><p class="depth3">---------</p><p class="depth3">Amount includible in gross income.........................     1,850</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the  third and fourth annual installments, totalling $33,000 (2x$16,500), are  received in a single subsequent taxable year of the surviving spouse.  The prorated amount of $15,000 of each annual installment, totalling  $30,000, shall be excluded even though the spouse receives more than one  annual installment in the single subsequent taxable year. However, the  surviving spouse is entitled to only one exclusion of $1,000 under  section 101(d)(1)(B) for each taxable year of receipt. The surviving  spouse shall include $2,000 in her gross income for the taxable year  with respect to the above installment payments ($33,000 less the sum of  $30,000 plus $1,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the  surviving spouse dies before receiving all ten annual installments and  the remaining installments are paid to her estate or beneficiary. In  such a case, $15,000 of each installment would continue to be excludable  from the gross income of the recipient, but any amounts received in  excess thereof would be fully includible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount held by an insurer. (1) For the purpose of the proration  referred to in section 101(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, an ``amount held by an insurer with  respect to any beneficiary'' means an amount equal to the present value  to such beneficiary (as of   the date of death of the insured) of an agreement by the insurer under a  life insurance policy (whether as an option or otherwise) to pay such  beneficiary an amount or amounts at a date or dates later than the death  of the insured (section 101(d)(2)). The present value of such agreement  is to be computed as if the agreement under the life insurance policy  had been entered into on the date of death of the insured, except that  such value shall be determined by the use of the mortality table and  interest rate used by the insurer in calculating payments to be made to  the beneficiary under such agreement. Where an insurance policy provides  an option for the payment of a specific amount upon the death of the  insured in full discharge of the contract, such lump sum is the amount  held by the insurer with respect to all beneficiaries (or their  beneficiaries) under the contract. See, however, paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of two or more beneficiaries, the ``amount held by  the insurer'' with respect to each beneficiary depends on the  relationship of the different benefits payable to such beneficiaries.  Where the amounts payable to two or more beneficiaries are independent  of each other, the ``amount held by the insurer with respect to each  beneficiary'' shall be determined and prorated over the periods involved  independently. Thus, if a certain amount per month is to be paid to A  for his life, and, concurrently, another amount per month is to be paid  to B for his life, the ``amount held by the insurer'' shall be  determined and prorated for both A and B independently, but the  aggregate shall not exceed the total present value of such payments to  both. On the other hand, if the obligation to pay B was contingent on  his surviving A, the ``amount held by the insurer'' shall be considered  an amount held with respect to both beneficiaries simultaneously.  Furthermore, it is immaterial whether B is a named beneficiary or merely  the ultimate recipient of payments for a term of years. For the special  rules governing the computation of the proration of the ``amount held by  an insurer'' in determining amounts excludable under the provisions of  section 101(d), see paragraphs (c) to (f), inclusive, of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the  policy was transferred for a valuable consideration, the total ``amount  held by an insurer'' cannot exceed the sum of the consideration paid  plus any premiums or other consideration paid subsequent to the transfer  if the provisions of section 101(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.101- 1 limit the excludability of the proceeds to such total.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of payments for life to a sole beneficiary. If the  contract provides for the payment of a specified lump sum, but, pursuant  to an agreement between the beneficiary and the insurer, payments are to  be made during the life of the beneficiary in lieu of such lump sum, the  lump sum shall be divided by the life expectancy of the beneficiary  determined in accordance with the mortality table used by the insurer in  determining the benefits to be paid. However, if payments are to be made  to the estate or beneficiary of the primary beneficiary in the event  that the primary beneficiary dies before receiving a certain number of  payments or a specified total amount, such lump sum shall be reduced by  the present value (at the time of the insured's death) of amounts which  may be paid by reason of the guarantee, in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, before making this  calculation. To the extent that payments received in each taxable year  do not exceed the amount found from the above calculation, they are  ``prorated amounts'' of the ``amount held by an insurer'' and are  excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary without regard to  whether he lives beyond the life expectancy used in making the  calculation. If the contract in question does not provide for the  payment of a specific lump sum upon the death of the insured as one of  the alternative methods of payment, the present value (at the time of  the death of the insured) of the payments to be made the beneficiary,  determined in accordance with the interest rate and mortality table used  by the insurer in determining the benefits to be paid, shall be used in  the above calculation in lieu of a lump sum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of payments to two or more beneficiaries--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Unrelated payments. If payments are to be made to two or more  beneficiaries, but the payments to be made to each are to be made  without regard to whether or not payments are made or continue to be  made to the other beneficiaries, the present value (at the time of the  insured's death) of such payments to each beneficiary shall be  determined independently for each such beneficiary. The present value so  determined shall then be divided by the term for which the payments are  to be made. If the payments are to be made for the life of the  beneficiary, the divisor shall be the life expectancy of the  beneficiary. To the extent that payments received by a beneficiary do  not exceed the amount found from the above calculation, they are  ``prorated amounts'' of the ``amount held by an insurer'' with respect  to such beneficiary and are excludable from the gross income of the  beneficiary without regard to whether he lives beyond any life  expectancy used in making the calculation. For the purpose of the  calculation described above, both the ``present value'' of the payments  to be made periodically and the ``life expectancy'' of the beneficiary  shall be determined in accordance with the interest rate and mortality  table used by the insurer in determining the benefits to be paid. If  payments are to be made to the estate or beneficiary of a primary  beneficiary in the event that such beneficiary dies before receiving a  certain number of payments or a specified total amount, the ``present  value'' of payments to such beneficiary shall not include the present  value (at the time of the insured's death) of amounts which may be paid  by reason of such a guarantee. See paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Related payments. If payments to be made to two or more  beneficiaries are in the nature of a joint and survivor annuity (as  described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-5), the present value (at the  time of the insured's death) of the payments to be made to all such  beneficiaries shall be divided by the life expectancy of such  beneficiaries as a group. To the extent that the payments received by a  beneficiary do not exceed the amount found from the above calculation,  they are ``prorated amounts'' of the ``amount held by an insurer'' with  respect to such beneficiary and are excludable from the gross income of  the beneficiary without regard to whether all the beneficiaries involved  live beyond the life expectancy used in making the calculation. For the  purpose of the calculation described above, both the ``present value''  of the payments to be made periodically and the ``life expectancy'' of  all the beneficiaries as a group shall be determined in accordance with  the interest rate and mortality table used by the insurer in determining  the benefits to be paid. If the contract provides that certain payments  are to be made in the event that all the beneficiaries of the group die  before a specified number of payments or a specified total amount is  received by them, the present value of payments to be made to the group  shall not include the present value (at the time of the insured's death)  of amounts which may be paid by reason of such a guarantee. See  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payments to secondary beneficiaries. Payments made by reason of  the death of a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) under a contract providing  that such payments shall be made in the event that the beneficiary (or  beneficiaries) die before receiving a specified number of payments or a  specified total amount shall be excluded from the gross income of the  recipient to the extent that such payments are made solely by reason of  such guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of present value of guaranteed payments. In the case  of payments which are to be made for a life or lives under a contract  providing that further amounts shall be paid upon the death of the  primary beneficiary (or beneficiaries) in the event that such  beneficiary (or beneficiaries) die before receiving a specified number  of payments or a specified total amount, the present value (at the time  of the insured's death) of all payments to be made under the contract  shall not include, for purposes of prorating the amount held by the  insurer, the present value of the payments which may be made to the  estate or beneficiary of the primary beneficiary. In   such a case, any lump sum amount used to measure the value of the amount  held by an insurer with respect to the primary beneficiary must be  reduced by the value at the time of the insured's death of any amounts  which may be paid by reason of the guarantee provided for a secondary  beneficiary or the estate of the primary beneficiary before prorating  such lump sum over the life or lives of the primary beneficiaries. Such  present value (of the guaranteed payment) shall be determined by the use  of the interest rate and mortality tables used by the insurer in  determining the benefits to be paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of payments not paid periodically. Payments made to  beneficiaries other than periodically shall be included in the gross  income of the recipients, but only to the extent that they exceed  amounts payable at the time of the death of the insured to each such  beneficiary or, where no such amounts are specified, the present value  of such payments at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The principles of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A life insurance policy provides for the payment of  $20,000 in a lump sum to the beneficiary at the death of the insured.  Upon the death of the insured, the beneficiary elects an option to leave  the proceeds with the company for five years and then receive payment of  $24,000, having no claim of right to any part of such sum before the  entire five years have passed. Upon the payment of the larger sum,  $24,000, the beneficiary shall include $4,000 in gross income and  exclude $20,000 therefrom. If it is assumed that the same insurer has  determined the benefits to be paid, the same result would obtain if no  lump sum amount were provided for at the death of the insured and the  beneficiary were to be paid $24,000 five years later. In neither of  these cases would the surviving spouse be able to exclude any additional  amount from gross income since both cases involve an amount held by an  insurer under an agreement to pay interest thereon to which section  101(c) applies, rather than an amount to be paid periodically after the  death of the insured to which section 101(d) applies.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. A life insurance policy provides that $1,200 per year  shall be paid the sole beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) until  a fund of $20,000 and interest which accrues on the remaining balance is  exhausted. A guaranteed rate of interest is specified, but excess  interest may be credited according to the earnings of the insurer.  Assuming that the fund will be exhausted in 20 years if only the  guaranteed interest is actually credited, the beneficiary shall exclude  $1,000 of each installment received ($20,000 divided by 20) and any  installments received, whether by the beneficiary or his estate or  beneficiary, in excess of 20 shall be fully included in the gross income  of the recipient. If, instead, the excess interest were to be paid each  year, any portion of each installment representing an excess over $1,000  would be fully includible in the recipient's gross income. Thus, if an  installment of $1,350 were received, $350 of it would be included in  gross income.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume that the sole life insurance policy of a decedent  provides only for the payment of $5,000 per year for the life of his  surviving spouse, beginning with the insured's death. If the present  value of the proceeds, determined by reference to the interest rate and  the mortality table used by the insurance company, is $60,000, and such  beneficiary's life expectancy is 20 years, $3,000 of each $5,000 payment  ($60,000 divided by 20) is excludable as the prorated portion of the  ``amount held by an insurer''. For each taxable year in which a payment  is made, an additional $1,000 is excludable from the gross income of the  surviving spouse. Hence, if she receives only one $5,000 payment in her  taxable year, only $1,000 is includible in her gross income in that year  with respect to such payment ($5,000 less the total amount excludable,  $4,000). Assuming that the policy also provides for payments of $2,000  per year for 10 years to the daughter of the insured, the present value  of the payments to the daughter is to be computed separately for the  purpose of determining the excludable portion of each payment to her.  Assuming that such present value is $15,000, $1,500 of each payment of  $2,000 received by the daughter is excludable from her gross income  ($15,000 divided by 10). The remaining $500 shall be included in the  gross income of the daughter.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Beneficiaries A and B, neither of whom is the surviving  spouse of the insured, are each to receive annual payments of $1,800 for  each of their respective lives upon the death of the insured. The  contract does not provide for payments to be made in any other manner.  Assuming that the present value of the payments to be made to A, whose  life expectancy according to the insurer's mortality table is 30 years,  is $36,000, A shall exclude $1,200 of each payment received ($36,000  divided by 30). Assuming that the present value of the payments to be  made to B, whose life expectancy according to the insurer's mortality  table is 20 years, is $27,000, B shall exclude $1,350 of each payment  received ($27,000 divided by 20).</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. A life insurance policy provides for the payment of  $76,500 in a lump sum to the beneficiary, A, at the death of the  insured. Upon the insured's death, however, A selects an option for the  payment of $2,000 per year for her life and for the same amount to be  paid after her death to B, her daughter, for her life. Assuming that  since A is 51 years of age and her daughter is 28 years of age, the  insurer determined the amount of the payments by reference to a  mortality table under which the life expectancy for the lives of both A  and B, joint and survivor, is 51 years, $1,500 of each $2,000 payment to  either A or B ($76,500 divided by 51, or $1,500) shall be excluded from  the gross income of the recipient. However, if A is the surviving spouse  of the insured and no other contracts of insurance whose proceeds are to  be paid to her at a date later than death are involved, A shall exclude  the entire payment of $2,000 in any taxable year in which she receives  but one such payment because of the additional exclusion under section  101(d)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Beneficiaries A and B, neither of whom is the surviving  spouse of the insured, are each to receive annual payments of $1,800 for  each of their respective lives upon the death of the insured, but after  the death of either, the survivor is to receive the payments formerly  made to the deceased beneficiary until the survivor dies. Assuming that  the life expectancy, joint and survivor, of A and B in accordance with  the mortality table used by the insurer is 32 years and assuming that  the total present value of the benefits to both (determined in  accordance with the interest rate used by the insurer) is $80,000, A and  B shall each exclude $1,250 of each installment of $1,800 ($80,000  divided by the life expectancy, 32, multiplied by the fraction of the  annual payment payable to each, one-half) until the death of either.  Thereafter, the survivor shall exclude $2,500 of each installment of  $3,600 ($80,000 divided by 32).</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. A life insurance policy provides for the payment of  $75,000 in a lump sum to the beneficiary, A, at the death of the  insured. A, upon the insured's death, however, selects an option for the  payment of $4,000 per year for life, with a guarantee that any part of  the $75,000 lump sum not paid to A before his death shall be paid to B  (or his estate). A's beneficiary. Assuming that, under the criteria used  by the insurer in determining the benefits to be paid, the present value  of the guaranteed amount to B is $13,500 and that A's life expectancy is  25 years, the lump sum shall be reduced by the present value of the  guarantee to B ($75,000 less $13,500, or $61,500) and divided by A's  life expectancy ($61,500 divided by 25, or $2,460). Hence, $2,460 of  each $4,000 payment is excludable from A's gross income. If A is the  surviving spouse of the insured and no other contracts of insurance  whose proceeds are to be paid to her at a date later than death are  involved, A shall exclude $3,460 of each $4,000 payment from gross  income in any taxable year in which but one such payment is received.  Under these facts, if any amount is paid to B by reason of the fact that  A dies before receiving a total of $75,000, the residue of the lump sum  paid to B shall be excluded from B's gross income since it is wholly in  lieu of the present value of such guarantee plus the present value of  the payments to be made to the first beneficiary, and is therefore  entirely an ``amount held by an insurer'' paid at a date later than  death (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Assume that an insurance policy does not provide for the  payment of a lump sum, but provides for the payment of $1,200 per year  for a beneficiary's life upon the death of the insured, and also  provides that if ten payments are not made to the beneficiary before  death a secondary beneficiary (whether named by the insured or by the  first beneficiary) shall receive the remainder of the ten payments in  similar installments. If, according to the criteria used by the  insurance company in determining the benefits, the present value of the  payments to the first beneficiary is $12,000 and the life expectancy of  such beneficiary is 15 years, $800 of each payment received by the first  beneficiary is excludable from gross income. Assuming that the same  figures obtain even though the payments are to be made at the rate of  $100 per month, the yearly exclusion remains the same unless more or  less than twelve months' installments are received by the beneficiary in  a particular taxable year. In such a case two-thirds of the total  received in the particular taxable year with respect to such beneficiary  shall be excluded from gross income. Under either of the above  alternatives, any amount received by the second beneficiary by reason of  the guarantee of ten payments is fully excludable from the beneficiary's  gross income since it is wholly in lieu of the present value of such  guarantee plus the present value of the payments to be made to the first  beneficiary and is therefore entirely an ``amount held by an insurer''  paid at a date later than death (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applicability of both section 101(c) and 101(d) to payments  under a single life insurance contract--(1) In general. Section 101(d)  shall not apply to interest payments on any amount held by an insurer  under an agreement to pay interest thereon (see sections 101(c) and  101(d)(4) and Sec. 1.101-3). On the other hand, both section 101(c) and  section 101(d) may be applicable to payments received under a single  life insurance contract, if such payments consist both   of interest on an amount held by an insurer under an agreement to pay  interest thereon and of amounts held by the insurer and paid on a date  or dates later than the death of the insured. One instance when both  section 101(c) and section 101(d) may be applicable to payments received  under a single life insurance contract is in the case of a permanent  life insurance policy with a family income rider attached. A typical  family income rider is one which provides additional term insurance  coverage for a specified number of years from the register date of the  basic policy. Under the policy with such a rider, if the insured dies at  any time during the term period, the beneficiary is entitled to receive  (i) monthly payments of a specified amount commencing as of the date of  death and continuing for the balance of the term period, and (ii) a lump  sum payment of the proceeds under the basic policy to be paid at the end  of the term period. If the insured dies after the expiration of the term  period, the beneficiary receives only the proceeds under the basic  policy. If the insured dies before the expiration of the term period,  part of each monthly payment received by the beneficiary during the term  period consists of interest on the proceeds of the basic policy (such  proceeds being retained by the insurer until the end of the term  period). The remaining part consists of an installment (principal plus  interest) of the proceeds of the terms insurance purchased under the  family income rider. The amount of term insurance which is provided  under the family income rider is, therefore, that amount which, at the  date of the insured's death, will provide proceeds sufficient to fund  such remaining part of each monthly payment. Since the proceeds under  the basic policy are held by the insurer until the end of the term  period, that portion of each monthly payment which consists of interest  on such proceeds is interest on an amount held by an insurer under an  agreement to pay interest thereon and is includible in gross income  under section 101(c). On the other hand, since the remaining portion of  each monthly payment consists of an installment payment (principal plus  interest) of the proceeds of the term insurance, it is a payment of an  amount held by the insurer and paid on a date later than the death of  the insured to which section 101(d) and this section applies (including  the $1,000 exclusion allowed the surviving spouse under section  101(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B))</em>. The proceeds of the basic policy, when received in a lump  sum at the end of the term period, are excludable from gross income  under section 101(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example of tax treatment of amounts received under a family  income rider. The following example illustrates the application of the  principles contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to payments  received under a permanent life insurance policy with a family income  rider attached:</p><p class="depth3">Example. The sole life insurance policy of the insured provides for  the payment of $100,000 to the beneficiary (the insured's spouse) on his  death. In addition, there is attached to the policy a family income  rider which provides that, if the insured dies before the 20th  anniversary of the basic policy, the beneficiary shall receive (i)  monthly payments of $1,000 commencing on the date of the insured's death  and ending with the payment prior to the 20th anniversary of the basic  policy, and (ii) a single payment of $100,000 payable on the 20th  anniversary of the basic policy. On the date of the insured's death, the  beneficiary (surviving spouse of the insured) is entitled to 36 monthly  payments of $1,000 and to the single payment of $100,000 on the 20th  anniversary of the basic policy. The value of the proceeds of the term  insurance at the date of the insured's death is $28,409.00 (the present  value of the portion of the monthly payments to which section 101(d)  applies computed on the basis that the interest rate used by the insurer  in determining the benefits to be paid under the contract is 2\1/4\  percent). The amount of each monthly payment of $1,000 which is  includible in the beneficiary's gross income is determined in the  following manner:  (a) Total amount of monthly payment.........................   $1,000.00 (b) Amount includible in gross income under section 101(c)        185.00</p><p class="depth3">as interest on the $100,000 proceeds under the basic policy</p><p class="depth3">held by the insurer until 20th anniversary of the basic</p><p class="depth3">policy (computed on the basis that the interest rate used</p><p class="depth3">by the insurer in determining the benefits to be paid under</p><p class="depth3">the contract is 2\1/4\ percent)............................ (c) Amount to which section 101(d) applies ((a) minus (b))..      815.00 (d) Amount excludable from gross income under section 101(d)      789.14</p><p class="depth3"><em>($28,409/36)</em>............................................... (e) Amount includible in gross income under section 101(d)         25.86</p><p class="depth3">without taking into account the $1,000 exclusion allowed</p><p class="depth3">the beneficiary as the surviving spouse ((c) minus (d))....</p><p class="depth3">The beneficiary, as the surviving spouse of the insured, is entitled to  exclude the amounts otherwise includible in gross income under section  101(d) (item (e)) to the extent such amounts do not exceed $1,000 in the  taxable year of receipt. This exclusion is not applicable, however, with  respect to the amount of each payment which is includible in gross  income under section 101(c) (item (b)). In this example, therefore, the  beneficiary must include $185 of each monthly payment in gross income  (amount includible under section 101(c)), but may exclude the $25.86  which is otherwise includible under section 101(d). The payment of  $100,000 which is payable to the beneficiary on the 20th anniversary of  the basic policy will be entirely excludable from gross income under  section 101(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section for a limitation on the  amount which shall be considered an ``amount held by an insurer'' in the  case of proceeds of life insurance which are paid subsequent to the  transfer of the policy for a valuable consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable  only with respect to amounts received during taxable years beginning  after October 28, 1961, irrespective of the date of the death of the  insured.
