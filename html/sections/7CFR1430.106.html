                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dairy operations must pay an initial administrative fee to FSA in the amount of $100 to participate in MPP-Dairy at the time of initial registration to participate. Each approved participating dairy operation must also pay a $100 administrative fee each year through December 31, 2018. Annual administrative fees are due and payable to FSA through the administrative county FSA office no later than the close of business on the last day of the annual election period established by the Deputy Administrator for each applicable calendar year of margin protection coverage under MPP-Dairy. The administrative fee paid is non-refundable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The required annual administrative fee is per dairy operation. Therefore, multiple dairy producers in a single unit participating dairy operation are required to pay only one annual administrative fee for the participating dairy operation. Conversely, in the case of a dairy producer that operates more than one dairy operation, each participating dairy operation is required to pay a separate administrative fee annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to pay the administrative fee timely will result in loss of margin protection coverage for the applicable calendar year. The payment will still be due, as provided in Sec. 1430.109.</p>
