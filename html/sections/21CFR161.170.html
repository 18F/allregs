(1) Canned Pacific salmon is the food prepared from one of the species of fish enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, prepared in one of the forms of pack specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and to which may be added one or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The food is packed in hermetically sealed containers and so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage and soften bones. The food is labeled in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Canned Pacific salmon is the food prepared from one of the species of fish enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, prepared in one of the forms of pack specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and to which may be added one or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

If the can size in question is not listed, calculate the value for Column II as follows: From the list, select as the comparable can size, that one having the nearest water capacity of the can size in question, multiply the net weight listed in Column II by the water capacity of the can size in question, and divide by the water capacity of the comparable can size. Water capacities are determined by the general method provided in Sec. 130.12(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling and acceptance procedure: The sample size of the sample representing the lot will be selected in accordance with the sampling plan shown in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
