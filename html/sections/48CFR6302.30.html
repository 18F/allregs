                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To facilitate settlements in cases which might involve lengthy hearings (in excess of one week) of complex factual disputes and settled legal principles, the Board has adopted two methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR): Settlement Judges and Mini-Trials. These procedures are designed to supplement existing settlement techniques and not to replace them. Procedures regarding implementation of these ADR methods will be distributed to the parties, in appropriate cases, but may be obtained from the Board upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To employ ADR both parties must initially agree to use an ADR method. The parties must communicate that agreement in writing to the presiding judge as early as possible, preferably before commencement of voluntary discovery. The presiding judge shall promptly decide the appropriateness of the ADR method requested and so advise the parties. Where, after application of an ADR method, the parties are unable to resolve a dispute, the matter shall be restored to the docket of the presiding judge for hearing.
