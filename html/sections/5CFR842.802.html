For the purpose of an  approval of coverage under this subpart, agency head is also deemed to  include the designated representative of the head of an executive  department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, except that, for provisions  dealing with law enforcement officers and firefighters, the designated  representative must be a department headquarters-level official who  reports directly to the executive department head, or to the deputy  department head, and who is the sole such representative for the entire  department. For the purpose of a denial coverage under this subpart,  agency head is also deemed to include the designated representative of  the agency head, as defined in the first sentence of this definition, at  any level within the agency.</p><p class="depth0">Air traffic controller means a civilian employee of the Department  of Transportation or the Department of Defense in an air traffic control  facility or flight service station facility who is actively engaged in  the separation and control of air traffic or in providing preflight,  inflight, or airport advisory service to aircraft operators, or who is  the immediate supervisor of such an employee, as provided by 5 U.S.C.  8401(35)(A). Also included in this definition is a civilian employee of  the Department of Transportation or the Department of Defense who is the  immediate supervisor of a person described under 5 U.S.C. 2109(1)(B)  (i.e., a second-level supervisor), as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8401(35)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Detention duties means duties that require frequent direct contact  in the detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training,  employment, care, transportation, or rehabilitation of individuals  suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the  United States or the District of Columbia or offenses against the  punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of  title 10, United States Code).

Also  included in this definition is an employee occupying a rigorous  firefighter position who moves to a supervisory or administrative  position and meets the conditions of Sec. 842.803(b).</p><p class="depth0">First-level supervisors are employees classified as supervisors who  have direct and regular contact with the employees they supervise.  First-level supervisors do not have subordinate supervisors. A first- level supervisor may occupy a rigorous position or a secondary position  if the appropriate definition is met.</p><p class="depth0">Frequent direct contact means personal, immediate, and regularly- assigned contact with detainees while performing detention duties, which  is repeated and continual over a typical work cycle.</p><p class="depth0">Law enforcement officer means an employee occupying a rigorous  position, whose primary duties are the investigation, apprehension, or  detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the  criminal laws of the United States, or the protection of officials of  the United States against threats to personal safety, as provided in 5  U.S.C. 8401(17).

Law enforcement officer also includes, as required by 5  U.S.C. 8401(17)(B), an employee of the Department of the Interior or the  Department of the Treasury who occupies a position that, but for  enactment of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, would be subject  to the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement System,  as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the  Treasury, as appropriate. Except as provided above, the definition does  not include an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order,  protecting life and property, guarding against or   inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than  those who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal  laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Primary duties means those duties of a position that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the  basic reasons for the existence of the position;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time  over a typical work cycle; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.</p><p class="depth0">Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature  cannot be considered ``primary'' even if they meet the substantial  portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends an average  of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of  duties, they are his or her primary duties.</p><p class="depth0">Rigorous position means a position the duties of which are so  rigorous that employment opportunities should, as soon as reasonably  possible, be limited (through establishment of a maximum entry age and  physical qualifications) to young and physically vigorous individuals  whose primary duties are--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To perform work directly connected with controlling and  extinguishing fires; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected  or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States  or protecting the personal safety of United States officials.  The condition in this definition that employment opportunities be  limited does not apply with respect to an employee who moves directly  (i.e., without a break in service exceeding 3 days) from one rigorous  law enforcement officer position to another or from one rigorous  firefighter position to another. Rigorous position is also deemed to  include a position held by a law enforcement officer as identified in 5  U.S.C. 8401(17)(B) (related to certain employees in the Departments of  the Interior and the Treasury).</p><p class="depth0">Secondary position means a position that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Is clearly in the law enforcement or firefighting field;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Is in an organization having a law enforcement or firefighting  mission; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Is either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supervisory; that is, a position whose primary duties are as a  first-level supervisor or law enforcement officers or firefighters in  rigorous positions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administrative; that is, an executive, managerial, technical,  semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a  rigorous law enforcement or firefighting position, or equivalent  experience outside the Federal Government, is a mandatory prerequisite.
