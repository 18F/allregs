                            <p class="depth0">For rotorcraft with retractable landing gear, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loads. The landing gear, retracting mechanism, wheel well doors,  and supporting structure must be designed for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loads occurring in any maneuvering condition with the gear  retracted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The combined friction, inertia, and air loads occurring during  retraction and extension at any airspeed up to the design maximum  landing gear operating speed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The flight loads, including those in yawed flight, occurring  with the gear extended at any airspeed up to the design maximum landing  gear extended speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Landing gear lock. A positive means must be provided to keep the  gear extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Emergency operation. When other than manual power is used to  operate the gear, emergency means must be provided for extending the  gear in the event of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any reasonably probable failure in the normal retraction system;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The failure of any single source of hydraulic, electric, or  equivalent energy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operation tests. The proper functioning of the retracting  mechanism must be shown by operation tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Position indicator. There must be means to indicate to the pilot  when the gear is secured in the extreme positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Control. The location and operation of the retraction control  must meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 29.777 and 29.779.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Landing gear warning. An aural or equally effective landing gear  warning   device must be provided that functions continuously when the rotorcraft  is in a normal landing mode and the landing gear is not fully extended  and locked. A manual shutoff capability must be provided for the warning  device and the warning system must automatically reset when the  rotorcraft is no longer in the landing mode.  [Doc.
