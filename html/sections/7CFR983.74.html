In the event that funds exceed  two production years' budgeted expenses, future assessments will be  reduced to bring the reserves to an amount that is less than or equal to  two production years' budgeted expenses. Such reserve funds may be used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To defray expenses, during any production year, prior to the  time assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To cover deficits incurred during any production year when  assessment income is less than expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all  provisions of this part are suspended; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of  termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required  to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in  such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided,  That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to  the persons from whom such funds were collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions  of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part  and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The  Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to  account for all receipts and disbursements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any  member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and  disbursements for which that member was personally responsible, deliver  all committee property and funds in the possession of such member to the  committee, and execute such assignments and other instruments as may be  necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title to all of  the committee property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant  to this part.
