                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Auger mining shall be conducted in accordance with the  backfilling and grading requirements of Sec. Sec. 816.102 and 816.104  through 816.106 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Remining. Where auger mining operations affect previously mined  areas that were not reclaimed to the standards of this chapter and the  volume of all reasonably available spoil is demonstrated in writing to  the regulatory authority to be insufficient to completely backfill the  highwall, the highwall shall be eliminated to the maximum extent  technically practical in accordance with the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person who conducts the auger mining operation shall  demonstrate to the regulatory authority that the backfill, designed by a  qualified registered professional engineer, has a minimum static safety  factor for the stability of the backfill of at least 1.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All spoil generated by the auger mining operation and any  associated surface coal mining and reclamation operation, and any other  reasonably available spoil shall be used to backfill the area.  Reasonably available spoil shall include spoil generated by the mining  operation and other spoil located in the permit area that is accessible  and available for use and that when rehandled will not cause a hazard to  the public safety or significant damage to the environment. For this  purpose, the permit area shall include spoil in the immediate vicinity  of the auger mining operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The coal seam mined shall be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of  nonacid-, nontoxic-forming material and the backfill graded to a slope  which is compatible with the approved postmining land use and which  provides adequate drainage and long-term stability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any remnant of the highwall shall be stable and not pose a  hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spoil placed on the outslope during previous mining operations  shall not be disturbed if such disturbances will cause instability of  the remaining spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public  health and safety or to the environment.</p>
