                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A franchising authority (or the Commission, pursuant to Sec.   76.945) may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion  of previously paid rates determined to be in excess of the permitted  tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator  has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged  as reasonable. An operator's liability for refunds shall be based on the  difference between the old bundled rates and the sum of the new  unbundled program service charge(s) and the new unbundled equipment  charge(s). Where an operator was charging separately for program  services and equipment but the rates were not in compliance with the  Commission's rules, the operator's refund liability shall be based on  the difference between the sum of the old charges and the sum of the  new, unbundled program service and equipment charges. Before ordering a  cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, a  franchising authority (or the Commission) must give the operator notice  and opportunity to comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An operator's liability for refunds in limited to a one-year  period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate  order issued by a franchising authority or the Commission shall be  liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order  until such time as it complies with such order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The refund period shall run as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the date the operator implements a prospective rate  reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is  shorter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the date a franchising authority issues an accounting order  pursuant to Sec.  76.933(c), to the date a prospective rate reduction is  issued, then back in time from the date of the accounting order to the  effective date of the rules; however, the total refund period shall not  exceed one year from the date of the accounting order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refund liability shall be calculated on the reasonableness of  the rates as determined by the rules in effect during the period under  review by the franchising authority or the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in  the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid  the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically  identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for  the   basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative  overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one- time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that  currently subscribe to the cable system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates  published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional  tax payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Once an operator has implemented a rate refund to subscribers in  accordance with a refund order by the franchising authority (or the  Commission, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section), the franchising  authority must return to the cable operator an amount equal to that  portion of the franchise fee that was paid on the total amount of the  refund to subscribers. The franchising authority must promptly return  the franchise fee overcharge either in an immediate lump sum payment, or  the cable operator may deduct it from the cable system's future  franchise fee payments. The franchising authority has the discretion to  determine a reasonable repayment period, but interest shall accrue on  any outstanding portion of the franchise fee starting on the date the  operator has completed implementation of the refund order. In  determining the amount of the refund, the franchise fee overcharge  should be offset against franchise fees the operator holds on behalf of  the franchising authority for lump sum payment. The interest rate on any  refund owed to the operator presumptively shall be 11.25%.
