                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a releasee is summoned or retaken by the Commission,  and the Commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the  releasee has violated one or more conditions of supervised release, the  Commission may take any of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restore the releasee to supervision, and where appropriate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reprimand the releasee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Modify the releasee's conditions of release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Refer the releasee to a residential community corrections  center for all or part of the remainder of the term of supervised  release; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revoke the term of supervised release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If supervised release is revoked, the Commission shall determine  whether the releasee shall be returned to prison to serve a new term of  imprisonment, and the length of that term, or whether a new term of  imprisonment shall be imposed but limited to time served. If the  Commission imposes a new term of imprisonment that   is less than the applicable maximum term of imprisonment authorized by  law, the Commission shall also determine whether to impose a further  term of supervised release to commence after the new term of  imprisonment has been served. If the new term of imprisonment is limited  to time served, any further term of supervised release shall commence  upon the issuance of the Commission's order. Notwithstanding the above,  if a releasee is serving another term of imprisonment of 30 days or more  in connection with a conviction for a federal, state, or local crime  (including a term of imprisonment resulting from a probation, parole, or  supervised release revocation), a further term of supervised release  imposed by the Commission under this paragraph shall not commence until  that term of imprisonment has been served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A releasee whose term of supervised release is revoked by the  Commission shall receive no credit for time spent on supervised release,  including any time spent in confinement on other sentences (or in a  halfway house as a condition of supervised release) prior to the  execution of the Commission's warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission's decision regarding the imposition of a term of  imprisonment following revocation of supervised release, and any further  term of supervised release, shall be made pursuant to the limitations  set forth in Sec.  2.219. Within those limitations, the appropriate  length of any term of imprisonment shall be determined by reference to  the guidelines at Sec.  2.21. If the term of imprisonment authorized  under Sec.  2.219 is less than the minimum of the appropriate guideline  range determined under Sec.  2.21, the term authorized under Sec.  2.219  shall be the guideline range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whenever the Commission imposes a term of imprisonment upon  revocation of supervised release that is less than the authorized  maximum term of imprisonment, it shall be the Commission's general  policy to impose a further term of supervised release that is the  maximum term of supervised release permitted by Sec.  2.219. If the  Commission imposes a new term of imprisonment that is equal to the  maximum term of imprisonment authorized by law (or in the case of a  subsequent revocation, that uses up the remainder of the maximum term of  imprisonment authorized by law), the Commission may not impose a further  term of supervised release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where deemed appropriate, the Commission may depart from the  guidelines at Sec.  2.21 (with respect to the imposition of a new term  of imprisonment) in order to permit the imposition of a further term of  supervised release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Decisions under this section shall be made upon the vote of one  Commissioner, except that a decision to override an examiner panel  recommendation shall require the concurrence of two Commissioners. The  final decision following a local revocation hearing shall be issued  within 86 days of the retaking of the releasee on a supervised release  violation warrant. The final decision following an institutional  revocation hearing shall be issued within 21 days of the hearing,  excluding weekends and holidays.</p>
