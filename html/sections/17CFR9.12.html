If the exchange determines in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section that a disciplinary action will become effective prior to the expiration of fifteen days after written notice thereof, it must notify the person disciplined in writing, either personally or by telegram or other means of written telecommunication to the person's last known address, stating the reasons for the determination. The exchange must also by telegram or other means of written telecommunication immediately notify the Commission (Attention: Contracts Markets Section, Division of Market Oversight). Where notice is delivered by telegram or other means of written telecommunication, the time within which the person so notified may file a petition for stay pursuant to Sec. 9.24(a)(2) will be increased by one day.
