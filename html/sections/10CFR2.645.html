                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The notice of hearing on part one of the application must set forth the matters of fact and law to be considered, as required by Sec. 2.104, which will be modified to state that the hearing will relate only to the matters related to Sec. 50.33(a) through (f) of this chapter, and the limited work authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After docketing of part two of the application, as provided in Sec. Sec. 2.101(a)(9) and 2.643(d), a supplementary notice of hearing will be published under Sec. 2.104 with respect to the remaining unresolved issues in the proceeding within the scope of Sec. 2.104. The supplementary notice of hearing will provide that any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding and who desires to participate as a party in the resolution of the remaining issues shall, file a petition for leave to intervene within the time prescribed in the notice. The petition to intervene must meet the applicable requirements in subpart C of this part, including Sec. 2.309. This supplementary notice will also provide appropriate opportunities for participation by a representative of an interested State under Sec. 2.315(c) and for limited appearances under Sec. 2.315(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person who was permitted to intervene under the initial notice of hearing on the limited work authorization and who was not dismissed or did not withdraw as a party, may continue to participate as a party with respect to the remaining unresolved issues only if, within the time prescribed for filing of petitions for leave to intervene in the supplementary notice of hearing, that person files a petition for intervention which meets the applicable requirements in subpart C of this part, including Sec. 2.309, provided, however, that the petition need not address Sec. 2.309(d). However, a person who was granted discretionary intervention under Sec. 2.309(e) must address in its petition the factors in Sec. 2.309(e) as they apply to the supplementary hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A party who files a non-timely petition for intervention under paragraph (b) of this section to continue as a party may be dismissed from the proceeding, absent a determination that the party has made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time, and with particular reference to

the factors specified in Sec. Sec. 2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iv) and 2.309(d). The notice will be ruled upon by the Commission or presiding officer designated to rule on petitions for leave to intervene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, the membership of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, or the individual presiding officer, as applicable, designated to preside in the proceeding on the remaining unresolved issues under the supplemental notice of hearing will be the same as the membership or individual designated to preside in the initial notice of hearing.
