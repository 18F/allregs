                                Sec.  1.173  Reissue specification, drawings, and amendments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of a reissue application. An application for reissue must contain the entire specification, including the claims, and the drawings of the patent. No new matter shall be introduced into the application. No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the claims of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 251.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specification, including claims. The entire specification, including the claims, of the patent for which reissue is requested must be furnished in the form of a copy of the printed patent, in double column format, each page on only one side of a single sheet of paper. If an amendment of the reissue application is to be included, it must be made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The formal requirements for papers making up the reissue application other than those set forth in this section are set out in Sec.  1.52. Additionally, a copy of any disclaimer (Sec.  1.321), certificate of correction (Sec. Sec.  1.322 through 1.324), or reexamination certificate (Sec.  1.570) issued in the patent must be included. (See also Sec.  1.178).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drawings. Applicant must submit a clean copy of each drawing sheet of the printed patent at the time the reissue application is filed. If such copy complies with Sec.  1.84, no further drawings will be required. Where a drawing of the reissue application is to include any changes relative to the patent being reissued, the changes to the drawing must be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The Office will not transfer the drawings from the patent file to the reissue application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Making amendments in a reissue application. An amendment in a reissue application is made either by physically incorporating the changes into the specification when the application is filed, or by a separate amendment paper. If amendment is made by incorporation, markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section must be used. If amendment is made by an amendment paper, the paper must direct that specified changes be made, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specification other than the claims. Changes to the specification, other than to the claims, must be made by submission of the entire text of an added or rewritten paragraph, including markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except that an entire paragraph may be deleted by a statement deleting the paragraph without presentation of the text of the paragraph. The precise point in the specification must be identified where any added or rewritten paragraph is located. This paragraph applies whether the amendment is submitted on paper or compact disc (see Sec. Sec.  1.52(e)(1) and 1.821(c), but not for discs submitted under Sec.  1.821(e)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims. An amendment paper must include the entire text of each claim being changed by such amendment paper and of each claim being added by such amendment paper. For any claim

changed by the amendment paper, a parenthetical expression ``amended,'' ``twice amended,'' etc., should follow the claim number. Each changed patent claim and each added claim must include markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except that a patent claim or added claim should be canceled by a statement canceling the claim without presentation of the text of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drawings. One or more patent drawings shall be amended in the following manner: Any changes to a patent drawing must be submitted as a replacement sheet of drawings which shall be an attachment to the amendment document. Any replacement sheet of drawings must be in compliance with Sec.  1.84 and shall include all of the figures appearing on the original version of the sheet, even if only one figure is amended. Amended figures must be identified as ``Amended,'' and any added figure must be identified as ``New.'' In the event that a figure is canceled, the figure must be surrounded by brackets and identified as ``Canceled.'' All changes to the drawing(s) shall be explained, in detail, beginning on a separate sheet accompanying the papers including the amendment to the drawings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, may be included. The marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as ``Annotated Marked-up Drawings'' and must be presented in the amendment or remarks section that explains the change to the drawings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, must be provided when required by the examiner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Status of claims and support for claim changes. Whenever there is an amendment to the claims pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, there must also be supplied, on pages separate from the pages containing the changes, the status (i.e., pending or canceled), as of the date of the amendment, of all patent claims and of all added claims, and an explanation of the support in the disclosure of the patent for the changes made to the claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Changes shown by markings. Any changes relative to the patent being reissued which are made to the specification, including the claims, upon filing, or by an amendment paper in the reissue application, must include the following markings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The matter to be omitted by reissue must be enclosed in brackets; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The matter to be added by reissue must be underlined, except for amendments submitted on compact discs (Sec. Sec.  1.96 and 1.821(c)). Matter added by reissue on compact discs must be preceded with ``'' and end with ``'' to properly identify the material being added.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Numbering of patent claims preserved. Patent claims may not be renumbered. The numbering of any claim added in the reissue application must follow the number of the highest numbered patent claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Amendment of disclosure may be required. The disclosure must be amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the drawings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Amendments made relative to the patent. All amendments must be made relative to the patent specification, including the claims, and drawings, which are in effect as of the date of filing of the reissue application.
