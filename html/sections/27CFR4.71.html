It shall be so made and formed as not to mislead the  purchaser. Wine containers shall be held (irrespective of the  correctness of the net contents specified on the label) to be so made  and formed as to mislead the purchaser if the actual capacity is  substantially less than the apparent capacity upon visual examination  under ordinary conditions of purchase or use; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fill. It shall be so filled as to contain the quantity of wine  specified in one of the standards of fill prescribed in Sec. 4.72; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Headspace. It shall be made and filled as to have a headspace  not in excess of 6 percent of its total capacity after closure if the  net content of the container is 187 milliliters or more, and a headspace  not in excess of 10 percent of such capacity in the case of all other  containers.
