                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emissions limits and work practice standards. (1) You must not discharge to the atmosphere exhaust gases that contain total PM in excess of 0.6 pound per ton of copper concentrate feed charged on a 24-hour average basis from any combination of stacks, vents, or other openings on furnaces, reactors, or other types of process vessels used for the production of anode copper from copper sulfide ore concentrates by pyrometallurgical techniques. Examples of such process equipment include, but are not limited to, copper concentrate dryers, smelting flash furnaces, smelting bath furnaces, converting vessels, combined smelting and converting reactors, anode refining furnaces, and anode shaft furnaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must not discharge to the atmosphere exhaust gases that contain total PM in excess of 0.6 pound per ton of copper concentrate feed charged on a 24-hour average basis from any combination of stacks, vents, or other openings on furnaces, reactors, or other types of process vessels used for the production of anode copper from copper sulfide ore concentrates by pyrometallurgical techniques. Examples of such process equipment include, but are not limited to, copper concentrate dryers, smelting flash furnaces, smelting bath furnaces, converting vessels, combined smelting and converting reactors, anode refining furnaces, and anode shaft furnaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released during the transfer of molten materials from smelting vessels and converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a baghouse or other PM control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must operate one or more capture systems that collect the gases and fumes released from each vessel used to refine blister copper, remelt anode copper, or remelt anode scrap and convey each collected gas stream to a baghouse or other PM control device. One control device may be used for multiple collected gas streams.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Monitoring requirements. (1) You must install, operate, and maintain a PM continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to measure and record PM concentrations and gas stream flow rates for the exhaust gases discharged to the atmosphere from each affected source subject to the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A single PM CEMS may be used for the combined exhaust gas streams from multiple affected sources at a point before the gases are discharged to the atmosphere. For each PM CEMS used to comply with this paragraph, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install, operate, and maintain a PM continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to measure and record PM concentrations and gas stream flow rates for the exhaust gases discharged to the atmosphere from each affected source subject to the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A single PM CEMS may be used for the combined exhaust gas streams from multiple affected sources at a point before the gases are discharged to the atmosphere. For each PM CEMS used to comply with this paragraph, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must install, certify, operate, and maintain the PM CEMS according to EPA Performance Specification 11 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and the quality assurance requirements of Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of the PM CEMS according to the requirements of Performance Specification 11 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. Thereafter, you must perform the performance evaluations as required by Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must perform quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests for the PM CEMS according to Procedure 2 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must install, operate, and maintain a weight measurement system to measure and record the weight of the copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel on a daily basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance requirements. (1) You must demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) this section within 180 days after startup and report the results in your notification of compliance status no later than 30 days after the end of the compliance demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) this section within 180 days after startup and report the results in your notification of compliance status no later than 30 days after the end of the compliance demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section using the procedures in paragraph (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section whenever your facility is producing copper from copper concentrate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must continuously monitor and record PM emissions, determine and record the daily (24-hour) value for each day, and calculate and record the daily average pounds of total PM per ton of copper concentrate feed charged

to the smelting vessel according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must calculate the daily average at the end of each calendar day for the preceding 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must maintain records of the calculations of daily averages with supporting information and data, including measurements of the weight of copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel. Collected PM CEMS data must be made available for inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative startup, shutdown, and malfunction requirements. You must comply with the requirements specified in this paragraph as an alternative to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3). In the event of an emergency situation, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. For the purpose of complying with this paragraph, an emergency situation is any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the facility owner or operator that requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the affected source to exceed an applicable emissions limitation under this subpart, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency must not include noncompliance to the extent it is caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the period of the emergency, you must implement all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the probable cause, your facility was being operated properly at the time the emergency occurred, and the corrective actions taken to minimize emissions as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must submit a notice of the emergency to the permitting authority within two working days of the time when emissions limitations were exceeded due to the emergency (or an alternate timeframe acceptable to the permitting authority). This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reports. You must submit to the permitting authority by the 20th day of each month a summary of the daily average PM per ton of copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel for the previous month.</p><p class="depth2">Other Requirements and Information</p>
