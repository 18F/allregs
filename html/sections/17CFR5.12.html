Nothing in this paragraph (h)  will limit the authority of any self-regulatory organization to request  or receive any information relative to its members' financial condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an applicant, all filings or other notices  provided for in this section will be considered filed when received by  the regional office of the Commission with jurisdiction over the state  in which the applicant's principal place of business is located and by  the National Futures Association. In the case of a registrant, all  filings or other notices provided for in this section will be considered  filed when received by the regional office of the Commission with  jurisdiction over the state in which the registrant's principal place of  business is located and by the registrant's designated self-regulatory  organization. Any copy that under paragraph (f)(2) or (g) of this  section is required to be filed with the Commission shall be filed with  the regional office of the Commission with   jurisdiction over the state in which the registrant's principal place of  business is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All filings or other notices filed pursuant to this section  which need not be certified in accordance with Sec. 1.16 may be  submitted to the Commission in electronic form using a a form of user  authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or  approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with  instructions issued by or approved by the Commission, if the retail  foreign exchange dealer or a designated self-regulatory organization has  provided the Commission with the means necessary to read and to process  the information contained in such report. Any such electronic submission  must clearly indicate the registrant or applicant on whose behalf such  filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting  such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual  signature of the authorized signer. In the case of a Form 1-FR filed via  electronic transmission in accordance with procedures established by or  approved by the Commission, such transmission must be accompanied by the  user authentication assigned to the authorized signer under such  procedures, and the use of such user authentication will constitute and  become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer  for the purpose of making the oath or affirmation referred to in  paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p>
