                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the  meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Petroleum refinery means any facility engaged in producing  gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils,  lubricants, or other products through distillation of petroleum or  through redistillation, cracking or reforming of unfinished petroleum  derivatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petroleum means the crude oil removed from the earth and the  oils derived from tar sands, shale, and coal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process gas means any gas generated by a petroleum refinery  process unit, except fuel gas and process upset gas as defined in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel gas means any gas which is generated at a petroleum  refinery and which is combusted. Fuel gas includes natural gas when the  natural gas is combined and combusted in any proportion with a gas  generated at a refinery. Fuel gas does not include gases generated by  catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators and fluid coking burners.  Fuel gas does not include vapors that are collected and combusted in a  thermal oxidizer or flare installed to control emissions from wastewater  treatment units or marine tank vessel loading operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Process upset gas means any gas generated by a petroleum  refinery process unit as a result of start-up, shut-down, upset or  malfunction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Refinery process unit means any segment of the petroleum  refinery in which a specific processing operation is conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fuel gas combustion device means any equipment, such as process  heaters, boilers and flares used to combust fuel gas, except facilities  in which gases are combusted to produce sulfur or sulfuric acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Coke burn-off means the coke removed from the surface of the  fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst by combustion in the catalyst  regenerator. The rate of coke burn-off is calculated by the formula  specified in Sec. 60.106.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Claus sulfur recovery plant means a process unit which recovers  sulfur from   hydrogen sulfide by a vapor-phase catalytic reaction of sulfur dioxide  and hydrogen sulfide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Oxidation control system means an emission control system which  reduces emissions from sulfur recovery plants by converting these  emissions to sulfur dioxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Reduction control system means an emission control system which  reduces emissions from sulfur recovery plants by converting these  emissions to hydrogen sulfide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Reduced sulfur compounds means hydrogen sulfide  (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon disulfide  (CS2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Fluid catalytic cracking unit means a refinery process unit in  which petroleum derivatives are continuously charged; hydrocarbon  molecules in the presence of a catalyst suspended in a fluidized bed are  fractured into smaller molecules, or react with a contact material  suspended in a fluidized bed to improve feedstock quality for additional  processing; and the catalyst or contact material is continuously  regenerated by burning off coke and other deposits. The unit includes  the riser, reactor, regenerator, air blowers, spent catalyst or contact  material stripper, catalyst or contact material recovery equipment, and  regenerator equipment for controlling air pollutant emissions and for  heat recovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator means one or  more regenerators (multiple regenerators) which comprise that portion of  the fluid catalytic cracking unit in which coke burn-off and catalyst or  contact material regeneration occurs, and includes the regenerator  combustion air blower(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Fresh feed means any petroleum derivative feedstock stream  charged directly into the riser or reactor of a fluid catalytic cracking  unit except for petroleum derivatives recycled within the fluid  catalytic cracking unit, fractionator, or gas recovery unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Contact material means any substance formulated to remove  metals, sulfur, nitrogen, or any other contaminant from petroleum  derivatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Valid day means a 24-hour period in which at least 18 valid  hours of data are obtained. A ``valid hour'' is one in which at least 2  valid data points are obtained.
