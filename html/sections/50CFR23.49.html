The following general  provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of a certificate for  live wildlife and plants, or their parts, products, or derivatives in an  exhibition that travels internationally:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Management Authority in the country of the exhibitor's  primary place of business must have determined that the specimens are  bred in captivity, artificially propagated, or pre-Convention and issued  a traveling-exhibition certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certificate must indicate that the wildlife or plant is part  of a traveling exhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A separate certificate must be issued for each live wildlife  specimen; a CITES document may be issued for more than one specimen for  a traveling exhibition of live plants and dead parts, products, or  derivatives of wildlife and plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The certificate is not transferable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Parties should treat the certificate like a passport for import  and export or re-export from each country, and should not collect the  original certificate at the border.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Parties should check specimens closely to determine that each  specimen matches the certificate and ensure that each live specimen is  being transported and cared for in a manner that minimizes the risk of  injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If offspring are born or a new specimen is acquired while the  traveling exhibition is in another country, the exhibitor must obtain  the appropriate CITES document for the export or re-export of the  specimen from the Management Authority of that country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Upon returning home, the exhibitor may apply for a traveling- exhibition certificate for wildlife born overseas or for wildlife or  plants acquired overseas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> U.S. application form.

When applying  for a U.S. certificate, you must provide sufficient information for us  to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The traveling exhibition makes multiple cross-border movements,  and   will return to the country in which the exhibition is based before the  certificate expires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cross-border movement must be for exhibition, and not for  breeding, propagating, or activities other than exhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The traveling exhibition is based in the country that issued the  certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The specimen meets the criteria for a bred-in-captivity  certificate, certificate for artificially propagated plants, or pre- Convention certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The exhibitor does not intend to sell or otherwise transfer the  wildlife or plant while traveling internationally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The wildlife or plant is securely marked or identified in such a  way that border officials can verify that the certificate and specimen  correspond. If a microchip is used, we may, if necessary, ask the  importer, exporter, or re-exporter to have equipment on hand to read the  microchip at the time of import, export, or re-export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec.   23.56, you must meet all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certificate may be used by you, and you must not transfer or  assign it to another person or traveling exhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must transport the specimen internationally only for  exhibition, not for breeding, propagating, or activities other than  exhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must present the certificate to the official for validation  at each border crossing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>For live plants, the quantity of plants must be reasonable for  the purpose of the traveling exhibition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must not sell or otherwise transfer the specimen, or any  offspring born to such specimen, while traveling internationally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the certificate is lost, stolen, or accidentally destroyed,  you may obtain a replacement certificate only from the U.S. Management  Authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If you no longer own the wildlife or plants, or no longer plan  to travel as a traveling exhibition, the original certificate must be  immediately returned to the U.S. Management Authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> You must return the traveling exhibition to the United States  before the certificate expires.</p>
