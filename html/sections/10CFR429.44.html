Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of commercial water heating equipment except residential-duty commercial water heaters, either by

testing, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions, or by applying an AEDM as set forth in Sec. 429.70.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certification reports. (1) The requirements of Sec. 429.12 are applicable to commercial WH equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following public equipment-specific information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commercial electric storage water heaters: The maximum standby loss in percent per hour (%/hr) and the measured storage volume in gallons (gal).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired storage water heaters: The thermal efficiency in percent (%), the maximum standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the rated storage volume in gallons (gal), and the nameplate input rate in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commercial water heaters and hot water supply boilers with storage capacity greater than 140 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%), whether the storage volume is greater than 140 gallons (Yes/No); whether the tank surface area is insulated with at least R-12.5 (Yes/No); whether a standing pilot light is used (Yes/No); for gas or oil-fired water heaters, whether the basic model has a fire damper or fan assisted combustion (Yes/No); and, if applicable, pursuant to 10 CFR 431.110, the maximum standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h) and measured storage volume in gallons (gal).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired instantaneous water heaters greater than or equal to 10 gallons and gas-fired and oil-fired hot water supply boilers greater than or equal to 10 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%), the maximum standby loss in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), the rated storage volume in gallons (gal), and the nameplate input rate in Btu/h.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Commercial gas-fired and oil-fired instantaneous water heaters less than 10 gallons and gas-fired and oil-fired hot water supply boilers less than 10 gallons: The thermal efficiency in percent (%) and the rated storage volume in gallons (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Commercial unfired hot water storage tanks: The thermal insulation (i.e., R-value) and stored volume in gallons (gal).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional, equipment-specific information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the basic model is engineered-to-order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any basic model rated with an AEDM, whether the manufacturer elects the witness test option for verification testing. (See Sec. 429.70(c)(5)(iii) for options). However, the manufacturer may not select more than 10% of AEDM-rated basic models to be eligible for witness testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 429.12(b)(13), a certification report may include supplemental testing instructions in PDF format. If necessary to run a valid test, the equipment-specific, supplemental information must include any additional testing and testing set up instructions (e.g., whether a bypass loop was used for testing) for the basic model and all other information (e.g., operational codes or overrides for the control settings) necessary to operate the basic model under the required conditions specified by the relevant test procedure. A manufacturer may also include with a certification report other supplementary items in PDF format (e.g., manuals) for DOE consideration in performing testing under subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternative methods for determining efficiency or energy use for commercial WH equipment can be found in Sec. 429.70 of this subpart.
