                                Sec. 63.1583  What are the emission points and control requirements
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The emission points and control requirements for an existing industrial POTW treatment plant are specified in the appropriate NESHAP(s) for the industrial user(s) (see Sec. 63.1582). For example, an existing industrial POTW treatment plant that provides treatment for a facility subject to subpart FF of this part, the National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations, must meet the treatment and control requirements specified in Sec. 61.348(d)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The emission points and control requirements for a new or reconstructed industrial POTW treatment plant are either those specified by the particular NESHAP(s) which apply to the industrial user(s) who discharge their waste for treatment to the POTW, or those emission points and control requirements set forth in Sec. 63.1586. The set of control requirements which applies to a particular new or reconstructed POTW is that set which requires the most stringent overall control of HAP emissions. If you are uncertain which set of requirements is more stringent, this determination should be made in consultation with the permitting authority. Reconstruction is defined in Sec. 63.1595.</p>
