determination is made within the 10-day or 20-day periods specified in Sec. Sec. 103.6 and 103.7, respectively, together with an extension pursuant to Sec. 103.8(a) or by agreement of the requester, the requester may commence an action under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B) in a United States district court in the district (1) in which the requester resides, (2) in which the requester's principal place of business is located, (3) in which the records are situated, or (4) in the District of Columbia. Service of process in that action is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.) applicable to actions against an agency of the United States.

Under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(F), the Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board, has authority, upon the issuance of a written finding by a court that the Customs officer or employee who was primarily responsible for withholding a record may have acted arbitrarily or capriciously, to initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against that officer or employee. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, submits its findings and recommendations to the Commissioner of Customs and the Secretary of the Treasury. The Special Counsel also sends copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or the representative of that officer or employee.
