For example, a  solicitation for home oxygen for a Veterans Integrated Service Network  (VISN) might result in multiple awards, each of which has a value of  less than $5 million. If the total of all awards under that solicitation  will exceed $5 million, the contracting officer must obtain a business  clearance   review of the entire package, including all proposed individual awards.</p>
