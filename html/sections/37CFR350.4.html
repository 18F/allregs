Each submission that is in a  language other than English shall be accompanied by an English-language  translation, duly verified under oath to be a true translation.

Oppositions to motions shall be filed  within five business days of the filing of the motion, and replies to  oppositions shall be filed within four business days of the filing of  the opposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Service list.
