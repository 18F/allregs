The request may be served at any time  after the filing of the answer without leave of the Presiding Officer.  The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by  individual item or by category, and shall describe each item or category  with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable  time, place and manner for making the inspection and performing the  related acts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for response. The party upon whom the request is  served shall serve a written response within twenty (20) days after  service of the request.

The response shall state, with respect to each  item or category requested, that inspection and related activities will  be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which  event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to  only part of an item or category, that part shall be so specified.
