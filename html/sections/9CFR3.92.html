                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) who moves (including loading and unloading) nonhuman primates within, to, or from the animal holding area of a terminal facility or a primary conveyance must do so as quickly and efficiently as possible, and must provide the following during movement of the nonhuman primate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shelter from sunlight and extreme heat. Sufficient shade must be provided to protect the nonhuman primate from the direct rays of the sun. A nonhuman primate must not be exposed to an ambient temperature above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for a period of more than 45 minutes while being moved to or from a primary conveyance or a terminal facility, The ambient temperature must be measured in the manner provided in Sec. 3.91(d) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shelter from rain or snow. Sufficient protection must be provided to allow nonhuman primates to remain dry during rain, snow, and other precipitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shelter from cold temperatures. Transporting devices on which nonhuman primates are placed to move them must be covered to protect the animals when the outdoor temperature falls below 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C). A nonhuman primate must not be exposed to an ambient air temperature below 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) for a period of more than 45 minutes, unless it is accompanied by a certificate of acclimation to lower temperatures as provided in Sec. 3.86(e) of this subpart. The ambient temperature must be measured in the manner provided in Sec. 3.91(d) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person handling a primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate must use care and must avoid causing physical harm or distress to the nonhuman primate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate must not be placed on unattended conveyor belts or on elevated conveyor belts, such as baggage claim conveyor belts and inclined conveyor ramps that lead to baggage claim areas, at any time; except that a primary enclosure may be placed on inclined conveyor ramps used to load and unload aircraft if an attendant is present at each end of the conveyor belt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate must not be tossed, dropped, or needlessly tilted, and must not be stacked in a manner that may reasonably be expected to result in its falling. It must be handled and positioned in the manner that written instructions and arrows on the outside of the primary enclosure indicate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section applies to movement of a nonhuman primate from primary conveyance to primary conveyance, within a primary conveyance or terminal facility, and to or from a terminal facility or a primary conveyance.
