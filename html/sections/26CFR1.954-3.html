Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation M. Corporation A purchases from M Corporation, a related  person, articles manufactured in the United States and sells the  articles to P, an unrelated person, for delivery and use in foreign  country Y. Gross income of A Corporation derived from the purchase and  sale of the personal property is foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation A in Example 1 also purchases from P, an  unrelated person, articles manufactured in country Y and sells the  articles to foreign corporation B, a related person, for use in foreign  country Z. Gross income of A Corporation derived from the purchase and  sale of the personal property is foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation C, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation N. By contract, N Corporation agrees to pay C Corporation, a  related person, a commission equal to 6 percent of the gross selling  price of all personal property shipped by N Corporation as the result of  orders solicited by C Corporation in foreign countries Y and Z. In  fulfillment of such orders, N Corporation ships products manufactured by  it in the United States. Corporation C does not assume title to the  property sold. Gross commissions received by C Corporation from N  Corporation in connection with the sale of such property for use in  countries Y and Z constitute foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation D, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country Y, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation R. In 1964, D Corporation acquires a United States  manufactured lathe from R Corporation. In 1972, after having made  substantial use of the lathe in its manufacturing business, D  Corporation sells the lathe to an unrelated person for use in foreign  country Z. Gross income from the sale of the lathe is not foreign base  company sales income since it is sold to an unrelated person after  substantial use has been made of it by D Corporation in its business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Controlled foreign corporation E, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country Y, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation P. Corporation E purchases from P Corporation articles  manufactured by P Corporation outside of country Y and sells the  articles to F Corporation, an unrelated person, for use in foreign  country Z. Corporation E finances the purchase of the articles by F  Corporation by agreeing to accept payment over an extended period of  time and receives not only the purchase price but also interest and  service fees. All gross income of E Corporation derived in connection  with the purchase and sale of the personal property, including interest  and service fees derived from financing the sale to F Corporation,  constitutes foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> may  be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation M. Corporation A purchases coffee beans grown in country X  from foreign corporation P, a related person, and sells the beans to M  Corporation, a related person, for use in the United States. Income from  the purchase and sale of the coffee beans by A Corporation is not  foreign base company sales income since the beans were grown in country  X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation B, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of controlled  foreign corporation C, also incorporated under the laws of country X.  Corporation B purchases and imports into country X rough diamonds mined  in foreign country Y; in country X it cuts, polishes, and shapes the  diamonds in a process which constitutes manufacturing within the meaning  of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. Corporation B sells the finished  diamonds to C Corporation, a related person, which in turn sells them  for use in foreign country Z. Since for purposes of this subparagraph  the finished diamonds are manufactured in country X, gross income  derived by C Corporation from their sale is not foreign base company  sales income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Property sold for use, consumption, or disposition within the  country in which the controlled foreign corporation is created or  organized--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Foreign base company sales income does not  include income derived in connection with the purchase and sale of  personal property (or purchase or sale of personal property on behalf of  a related person) in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, (a) if the property is sold for use, consumption, or  disposition in the country under the laws of which the controlled  foreign corporation which purchases and sells the property (or sells on  behalf of a related person) is created or organized or (b), where the  property is purchased by the controlled foreign corporation on behalf of  a related person, if such property is purchased for use, consumption, or  disposition in the country under the laws of which such controlled  foreign corporation is created or organized. See section 954(d)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for determining country of use, consumption, or  disposition. As a general rule, personal property which is sold to an  unrelated person will be presumed for purposes of this subparagraph to  have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the country of  destination of the property sold; for such purpose, the occurrence in a  country of a temporary interruption in shipment of goods shall not  constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at the  time of a sale of personal property to an unrelated person the  controlled foreign corporation knew, or should have known from the facts  and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property  probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of  destination, the controlled foreign corporation must determine the  country of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition of the property or  the property will be presumed to have been used, consumed, or disposed  of outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign  corporation is created or organized. A controlled foreign corporation  which sells personal property to a related person is presumed to sell  such property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the country  under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or  organized unless such corporation establishes the use made of the  property by the related person; once it has established that the related  person has disposed of the property, the rules in the two preceding  sentences relating to sales by a controlled foreign corporation to an  unrelated person will apply at the first stage in the chain of  distribution at which a sale is made by a related person to an unrelated  person. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subdivision, a  controlled foreign corporation which sells personal property to any  person all of   whose business except for an insubstantial part consists of selling from  inventory to retail customers at retail outlets all within one country  may assume at the time of such sale to such person that such property  will be used, consumed, or disposed of within such country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fungible goods. For purposes of this subparagraph, a  controlled foreign corporation which sells to a purchaser personal  property which because of its fungible nature cannot reasonable be  specifically traced to other purchasers and to the countries of ultimate  use, consumption, or disposition shall, unless such corporation  establishes a different disposition as being proper, treat such property  as being sold, for ultimate use, consumption, or disposition in those  countries, and to those other purchasers, in the same proportions in  which property from the fungible mass of the first purchaser is sold in  the regular course of business by such first purchaser. No apportionment  need be made, however, on the basis of sporadic sales by the first  purchaser. This subdivision shall apply only in a case where the  controlled foreign corporation knew, or should have known from the facts  and circumstances surrounding the transaction, the manner in which the  first purchaser disposes of goods from the fungible mass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, and controlled foreign corporation B,  incorporated under the laws of foreign country Y, are related persons.  Corporation A purchases from B Corporation electric transformers  produced by B Corporation in country Y and sells the transformers to D  Corporation, an unrelated person, for installation in a factory building  being constructed in country X. Since the personal property purchased  and sold by A Corporation is to be used within the country in which A  Corporation is incorporated, income of A Corporation derived from the  purchase and sale of the electric transformers is not foreign base  company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation C, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation N. Corporation C purchases from N Corporation sewing  machines manufactured in the United States by N Corporation and sells  the sewing machines to retail department stores, unrelated persons,  located in foreign country X. The entire activities of the department  stores to which C Corporation sells the machines consist of selling  goods from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets in country X.  Under these circumstances, at the time of sale C Corporation may assume  the sewing machines will be used, consumed, or disposed of in country X,  and no attempt need be made by C Corporation to determine where the  sewing machines will ultimately be used by the customers of the retail  department stores. Gross income of C Corporation derived from the sales  to the department stores located in country X is not foreign base  company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation D, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country Y, and controlled foreign corporation E,  incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, are related persons.  Corporation D purchases from E Corporation sulphur extracted by E  Corporation from deposits located in country X. Corporation D sells the  sulphur to F Corporation, an unrelated person, for delivery to F  Corporation's storage facilities located in country Y. At the time of  the sale of the sulphur from D Corporation to F Corporation, D  Corporation knows that F Corporation is actively engaged in the business  of selling a large amount of sulphur in country Y but also that F  Corporation sells, in the normal course of its business, 25 percent of  its sulphur for ultimate consumption in foreign country Z. However, D  Corporation has no knowledge at the time of sale whether any portion of  the particular shipment it sells to F Corporation will be resold by F  Corporation for ultimate use, consumption, or disposition outside  country Y. Moreover, delivery of the sulphur to F Corporation's storage  facilities constitutes more than a temporary interruption in the  shipment of the sulphur. Under such circumstances, D Corporation may,  but is not required to, trace the ultimate disposition by F Corporation  of the personal property sold to F Corporation; however, if D  Corporation does not trace the ultimate disposition and if it does not  establish a different disposition as being proper, 25 percent of the  sulphur sold by D Corporation to F Corporation will be treated as being  sold for consumption in country Z and 25 percent of the gross income  from the sale of sulphur by D Corporation to F Corporation will be  treated as foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation G, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation P. Corporation G purchases from P Corporation toys  manufactured in the United States by P Corporation and sells the toys to  R, an unrelated person, for delivery to a duty-free port in country X.   Instructions for the assembly and operation of the toys are printed in a  language which is not commonly used in country X. From the facts and  circumstances surrounding the sales to R, G Corporation knows, or should  know, that the toys will probably not be used, consumed, or disposed of  within country X. Therefore, unless G Corporation determines the use to  be made of the toys by R, such property will be presumed to have been  sold by R for use, consumption, or disposition outside of country X, and  the entire gross income of G Corporation derived from the sales will be  considered foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property manufactured, produced, or constructed by the  controlled foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Foreign base company  sales income does not include income of a controlled foreign corporation  derived in connection with the sale of personal property manufactured,  produced, or constructed by such corporation. A controlled foreign  corporation will have manufactured, produced, or constructed personal  property which the corporation sells only if such corporation satisfies  the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii), or (a)(4)(iv) of  this section through the activities of its employees (as defined in  Sec. 31.3121(d)-1(c) of this chapter) with respect to such property. A  controlled foreign corporation will not be treated as having  manufactured, produced, or constructed personal property which the  corporation sells merely because the property is sold in a different  form than the form in which it was purchased. For rules of apportionment  in determining foreign base company sales income derived from the sale  of personal property purchased and used as a component part of property  which is not manufactured, produced, or constructed, see paragraph  (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, operates a paper factory in foreign country  Y. Corporation A purchases from a related person wood pulp grown in  country Y. Corporation A, by a series of processes, converts the wood  pulp to paper which it sells for use in foreign country Z. The  transformation of wood pulp to paper constitutes the manufacture or  production of property for purposes of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation B, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, purchases steel rods from a related person  which produces the steel in foreign country Y. Corporation B operates a  machining plant in country X in which it utilizes the purchased steel  rods to make screws and bolts. The transformation of steel rods to  screws and bolts constitutes the manufacture or production of property  for purposes of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation C, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, purchases tuna fish from unrelated persons  who own fishing boats which catch such fish on the high seas.  Corporation C receives such fish in country X in the condition in which  taken from the fishing boats and in such country processes, cans, and  sells the fish to related person D, incorporated under the laws of  foreign country Y, for consumption in foreign country Z. The  transformation of such fish into canned fish constitutes the manufacture  or production of property for purposes of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, sells industrial engines for use,  consumption, and disposition outside country X. Corporation A, in  connection with the assembly of such engines, performs machining and  assembly operations. In addition, A Corporation purchases, from related  and unrelated persons, components manufactured in foreign country Y. On  a per unit basis, A Corporation's selling price and costs of such  engines are as follows:  Selling price...................................  ......  ......    $400 Cost of goods sold:</p><p class="depth0">Material--</p><p class="depth0">Acquired from related persons...............    $100</p><p class="depth0">Acquired from others........................      40</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total material.............................  ......    $140 Conversion costs (direct labor and factory burden)......      70</p><p class="depth0">-------- Total cost of goods sold........................  ......     210</p><p class="depth0">--------- Gross profit....................................  ......     190 Administrative and selling expenses.............  ......      50</p><p class="depth0">========= Taxable income..................................  ......     140</p><p class="depth0">The conversion costs incurred by A Corporation are more than 20 percent  of total costs of goods sold ($70/$210 or 33 percent). Although the  product sold, an engine, is not sufficiently distinguishable from the  components to constitute a substantial transformation of the purchased  parts within the meaning of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, A  Corporation will be considered under this subdivision to have  manufactured the product it sells.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation B, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, operates an automobile assembly plant. In  connection with such activity, B Corporation purchases from related  persons assembled engines, transmissions, and certain other components,  all of which are manufactured outside of country X; purchases additional  components from unrelated persons; conducts stamping, machining, and  subassembly operations; and has a substantial investment in tools, jigs,  welding equipment, and other machinery and equipment used in the  assembly of an automobile. On a per unit basis, B Corporation's selling  price and costs of such automobiles are as follows:  Selling price..........................  .........  .........     $2,500 Cost of goods sold:</p><p class="depth0">Material--</p><p class="depth0">Acquired from related persons......     $1,200</p><p class="depth0">Acquired from others...............        275</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total material....................  .........     $1,475 Conversion costs (direct labor and factory burden)         25</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total cost of goods sold.....................  .........      1,800</p><p class="depth0">------------ Gross profit......................................  .........        700 Administrative and selling expenses...............  .........        300</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable income...............................  .........        400</p><p class="depth0">============</p><p class="depth0">The product sold, an automobile, is not sufficiently distinguishable  from the components purchased (the engine, transmission, etc.) to  constitute a substantial transformation of purchased parts within the  meaning of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. Although conversion  costs of B Corporation are less than 20 percent of total cost of goods  sold ($325/$1800 or 18 percent), the operations conducted by B  Corporation in connection with the property purchased and sold are  substantial in nature and are generally considered to constitute the  manufacture of a product. Corporation B will be considered under this  subdivision to have manufactured the product it sells.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation C, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, purchases from related persons radio parts  manufactured in foreign country Y. Corporation C designs radio kits,  packages component parts required for assembly of such kits, and sells  the parts in a knocked-down condition to unrelated persons for use  outside country X. These packaging operations of C Corporation do not  constitute the manufacture, production, or construction of personal  property for purposes of section 954(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> applies and if the  facts and circumstances evince that the controlled foreign corporation  makes a substantial contribution through the activities of its employees  to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property   sold, then the personal property sold by the controlled foreign  corporation is manufactured, produced, or constructed by such controlled  foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Activities. The determination of whether a controlled foreign  corporation makes a substantial contribution through the activities of  its employees to the manufacture, production, or construction of the  personal property sold involves, but will not necessarily be limited to,  consideration of the following activities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Oversight and direction of the activities or process pursuant to  which the property is manufactured, produced, or constructed (under the  principles of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or (a)(4)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Activities that are considered in, but that are insufficient to  satisfy, the tests provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Material selection, vendor selection, or control of the raw  materials, work-in-process or finished goods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Management of manufacturing costs or capacities (for example,  managing the risk of loss, cost reduction or efficiency initiatives  associated with the manufacturing process, demand planning, production  scheduling, or hedging raw material costs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Control of manufacturing related logistics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Quality control (for example, sample testing or establishment of  quality control standards).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Developing, or directing the use or development of, product  design and design specifications, as well as trade secrets, technology,  or other intellectual property for the purpose of manufacturing,  producing, or constructing the personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of substantial contribution test. When considering  whether a controlled foreign corporation makes a substantial  contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the  personal property, the performance of any activity in paragraph  (a)(4)(iv)(b) of this section will be taken into account. The  performance or lack of performance of any particular activity in  paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(b) of this section, or of a particular number of  activities in (a)(4)(iv)(b) of this section, is not determinative. The  weight accorded to the performance of any quantum of any activity  (whether or not specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(b) of this section)  will vary with the facts and circumstances of the particular business.  See paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(d) Examples 8, 10 and 11 of this section. In  determining whether the activities of the controlled foreign corporation  constitute a substantial contribution, there is no minimum performance  threshold before an activity can be considered. The fact that other  persons make a substantial contribution to the manufacture, production,  or construction of the personal property prior to sale does not preclude  the controlled foreign corporation from making a substantial  contribution to the manufacture, construction, or production of that  property through the activities of its employees. See paragraph  (a)(4)(iv)(d) Example 9 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  FS, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases raw materials from a  related person. The raw materials are manufactured (under the principles  of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or (a)(4)(iii) of this section) into Product X  by CM, an unrelated corporation, pursuant to a contract manufacturing  arrangement. CM physically performs the substantial transformation,  assembly, or conversion outside of FS's country of organization. Product  X is sold by FS for use outside of FS's country of organization. Under  the terms of the contract, FS retains the right to control the raw  materials, work-in-process, and finished goods, and the right to oversee  and direct the activities or process pursuant to which Product X is  manufactured by CM. FS owns the intellectual property used in the  manufacturing process. However, FS does not exercise, through its  employees, its powers to control the raw materials, work-in-process, or  finished goods, and FS does not exercise its powers of oversight and  direction. Likewise, FS does not, through its employees, develop or  direct the use or development of the intellectual property for the  purpose of manufacturing Product X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or (a)(4)(iii) of this  section with respect to Product X.   Therefore, this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) applies.

FS retains the right to  oversee and direct the activities or process pursuant to which Product X  is manufactured by CM, but does not exercise, through its employees, its  powers of oversight and direction. FS is the owner of sophisticated  software and network systems that remotely and automatically (without  human involvement) take orders, route them to CM, order raw materials,  and perform quality control. FS has a small number of computer  technicians who monitor the software and network systems to ensure that  they are running smoothly and apply any necessary patches or fixes. The  software and network systems were developed by employees of DP, the U.S.  corporate parent of FS. DP's employees supervise the computer  technicians, evaluate the results of the automated manufacturing  business, and make ongoing operational decisions, including decisions  related to acceptable performance of the manufacturing process,  stoppages of that process, and decisions related to product and  manufacturing process design. DP's employees develop and provide to FS  all of the upgrades to the software and network systems. DP also has  employees who direct and control other aspects of the manufacturing  process such as vendor and material selection, management of the  manufacturing costs and capacities, and the selection of CM. The need  for DP's employees to direct the activities of the FS employees and  otherwise contribute to the manufacturing process evinces that  substantial operational responsibilities and decision making are  required to be exercised by parties other than CM in order to  manufacture Product X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> or (a)(4)(iii) of this  section with respect to Product X.

Product X  is sold by FS1 and FS2 to persons related to FS1 and FS2, respectively,  for disposition outside of FS1's and FS2's respective countries of  organization. FS1, through its employees, designs Product X. FS1 directs  the use of the product design and design specifications, and other  intellectual property, for the purpose of manufacturing Product X.  Employees of FS1 also select the materials that will be used to  manufacture Product X, and the vendors that provide those materials.  FS2, through its employees, designs the process for manufacturing  Product X. FS2, through its employees, manages the manufacturing costs  and capacities with respect to Product X.

In the analysis of whether FS1 or FS2 make a substantial  contribution to the manufacture of Product X, each company takes into  account its individual activities, including those of providing quality  control and oversight and direction of the manufacture of Product X. In  addition, no threshold level of activity is required, including with  respect to providing quality control or oversight and direction of the  activities or process pursuant to which Product X is manufactured,  before FS1 and FS2 can take into account their respective activities.

The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(c)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Multiple branches contribute to the manufacture of a  single product only one branch satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i). (i) Facts.  FS is a controlled foreign corporation organized in Country M. FS  operates three branches, Branch A, Branch B, and Branch C, located  respectively in Country A, Country B, and Country C. Branch A, Branch B,  and Branch C each performs different manufacturing activities with  respect to the manufacture of Product X. Branch A, through the  activities of employees of FS located in Country A, designs Product X.  Branch B, through the activities of employees of FS located in Country  B, provides quality control and oversight and direction. Branch C,  through the activities of employees of FS located in Country C,  manufactures Product X (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or  (a)(4)(iii) of this section) using the designs developed by Branch A and  under the oversight of the quality control personnel of Branch B. The  activities of Branch A and Branch B do not independently satisfy  paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Employees of FS located in Country  M purchase the raw materials used in the manufacture of Product X from a  related person and control the work-in-process and finished goods  throughout the manufacturing process. Employees of FS located in Country  M also manage the manufacturing costs and capacities related to Product  X. Further, employees of FS located in Country M oversee the  coordination between the branches. The activities of the remainder of FS  in Country M do not independently satisfy paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this  section. Employees of FS located in Country M sell Product X to  unrelated persons for use outside of Country M. The sales income from  the sale of Product X is taxed in Country M at an effective rate of tax  of 10%. Country C imposes an effective rate of tax of 20% on sales  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except for the  following. In addition to the design of Product X, Branch A also  performs in Country A other manufacturing activities, including those  ascribed to FS in Example 1, that are sufficient to qualify as  manufacturing under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section with respect to  Product X. Country A imposes an effective rate of tax of 12% on sales  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(b)</em> of this section. The  effective rate of tax in Country B is not considered because Branch B  does not satisfy paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Neither Branch A  nor Branch C is treated as a separate corporation because the effective  rate of tax on the sales income of FS from the sale of Product X (10%)  is not less than 90% of, and at least 5 percentage points less than, the  effective rate of tax that would apply to such income in the country in  which Branch A is located (12%). Sales of Product X by the remainder of  the controlled foreign corporation are not treated as made on behalf of  any branch.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Determining the location of manufacture when  manufacturing activities performed by multiple branches and no branch  independently satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i). (i) Facts. FS, a controlled  foreign corporation organized in Country M, purchases raw materials from  a related person. The raw materials are manufactured (under the  principles of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or (a)(4)(iii) of this section) into  Product X by CM, an unrelated corporation, pursuant to a contract  manufacturing arrangement. CM physically performs the substantial  transformation, assembly, or conversion of the raw materials in Country  C. FS has two branches, Branch A and Branch B, located in Country A and  Country B respectively. Branch A, through the activities of employees of  FS located in Country A, designs Product X. Branch B, through the  activities of employees of FS located in Country B, controls  manufacturing related logistics, provides oversight and direction during  the manufacturing process, and controls the raw materials and work-in- process. FS manages the manufacturing costs and capacities related to  the manufacture of Product X through employees located in Country M.  Further, employees of FS located in Country M oversee the coordination  between the branches. Employees of FS located in Country M also sell  Product X to unrelated persons for use outside of Country M. Country M  imposes an effective rate of tax on sales income of 10%. Country A  imposes an effective rate of tax on sales income of 20%, and Country B  imposes an effective rate of tax on sales income of 24%. Neither the  remainder of FS, nor any branch of FS independently satisfies paragraph  (a)(4)(i) of this section.

Under the facts and  circumstances of the business, the activities of the remainder of FS  would not provide a greater contribution to the manufacture of Product X  than the activities of Branch A   and Branch B, considered together. Therefore, the location of  manufacture is Country A, the location of Branch A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The application of this paragraph (b) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is engaged in the manufacturing business in  such country. Corporation A negotiates sales of its products for use  outside of country X through a sales office, branch B, maintained in  foreign country Y. These activities constitute the only activities of A  Corporation. Country X levies an income tax at an effective rate of 50  percent on the income of A Corporation derived by the manufacturing  plant in country X but does not tax the sales income of A Corporation  derived by branch B in country Y. Country Y levies an income tax at an  effective rate of 10 percent on the sales income derived by branch B but  does not tax the income of A Corporation derived by the manufacturing  plant in country X. If the sales income derived by branch B were, under  the laws of country X, derived from sources within country X by A  Corporation, such income would be taxed by such country at an effective  rate of 50 percent. In determining foreign base company sales income of  A Corporation, branch B is treated as a separate wholly owned subsidiary  corporation of A Corporation, the 10 percent rate of tax on branch B's  income being less than 90 percent of, and at least 5 percentage points  less than, the 50 percent rate. Income derived by branch B, treated as a  separate corporation, from the sale by or through it for use,  consumption, or disposition outside country Y of the personal property  produced in country X is treated as income from the sale of personal  property on behalf of A Corporation, a related person, and constitutes  foreign base company sales income. The remainder of A Corporation,  treated as a separate corporation, derives no foreign base company sales  income since it produces the product which is sold.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation C is incorporated under  the laws of foreign country X. Corporation C maintains branch B in  foreign country Y. Branch B manufactures articles in country Y which are  sold through the sales offices of C Corporation located in country X.  These activities constitute the only activities of C Corporation.  Country Y levies an income tax at an effective rate of 30 percent on the  manufacturing profit of C Corporation derived by branch B but does not  tax the sales income of C Corporation derived by the sales offices in  country X. Country X does not impose an income, war profits, excess  profits, or similar tax, and no tax is paid to any foreign country with  respect to income of C Corporation which is not derived by branch B. If  C Corporation were incorporated under the laws of country Y, the sales  income of the sales offices in country X would be taxed by country Y at  an effective rate of 30 percent. In determining foreign base company  sales income of C Corporation, branch B is treated as a separate wholly  owned subsidiary corporation of C Corporation, the zero rate of tax on  the income derived by the remainder of C Corporation being less than 90  percent of, and at least 5 percentage points less than, the 30 percent  rate. Branch B, treated as a separate corporation, derives no foreign  base company sales income since it produces the product which is sold.  Income derived by the remainder of C Corporation, treated as a separate  corporation, from the sale by or through it for use, consumption, or  disposition outside country X of the personal property produced in  country Y is treated as income from the sale of personal property on  behalf of branch B, a related person, and constitutes foreign base  company sales income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation E, a controlled foreign  corporation incorporated under the laws of foreign Country X, is a  wholly owned subsidiary of Corporation D, also a controlled foreign  corporation incorporated under the laws of Country X. Corporation E  maintains Branch B in foreign Country Y. Both corporations use the  calendar year as the taxable year. In 1964, Corporation E's sole  activity, carried on through Branch B, consists of the purchase of  articles manufactured in Country X by Corporation D, a related person,  and the sale of the articles through Branch B to unrelated persons. One  hundred percent of the articles sold through Branch B are sold for use  outside Country X and 90% are also sold for use outside of Country Y.  The income of Corporation E derived by Branch B from such transactions  is taxed to Corporation E by Country X only at the time Corporation E  distributes such income to Corporation D and is taxed on the basis of  what the tax (a 40% effective rate) would have been if the income had  been derived in 1964 by Corporation E from sources within Country X from  doing business through a permanent establishment therein. Country Y  levies an income tax at an effective rate of 50% on income derived from  sources within such country, but the income of Branch B for 1964 is  effectively taxed by Country Y at a 5% rate since under the laws of such  country, only 10% of Branch B's income is derived from sources within   such country. Corporation E makes no distributions to Corporation D in  1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. In determining foreign base company sales income of  Corporation E for 1964, Branch B is treated as a separate wholly owned  subsidiary corporation of Corporation E, the 5% rate of tax being less  than 90% of, and at least 5 percentage points less than the 40% rate.  Income derived by Branch B, treated as a separate corporation, from the  purchase from a related person (Corporation D), of personal property  manufactured outside of Country Y and sold for use, disposition, or  consumption outside of Country Y constitutes foreign base company sales  income. If, instead, Corporation D were unrelated to Corporation E, none  of the income would be foreign base company sales income because  Corporation E would be purchasing from and selling to unrelated persons  and if Branch B were treated as a separate corporation it would likewise  be purchasing from and selling to unrelated persons. Alternatively, if  Corporation D were related to Corporation E, but Branch B manufactured  the articles prior to sale under the principles of paragraph (a)(4)(iv)  of this section, the income would not be foreign base company sales  income because Branch B, treated as a separate corporation, would  qualify for the manufacturing exception under paragraph (a)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation F, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic  corporation M. Corporation F, through its branch B in foreign country Y,  purchases from controlled foreign corporation G, a wholly owned  subsidiary of M Corporation incorporated under the laws of foreign  country Z, personal property which G Corporation manufactures in country  Z. Corporation F sells such property for use in foreign country W. Since  the income of F Corporation from such purchases and sales is classified  as foreign base company sales income under section 954(d)(1) and  paragraph (a) of this section, branch B will not be treated as a  separate corporation with respect to such income even if the tax  differential between countries X and Y would otherwise justify such  treatment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is engaged in manufacturing articles through  its home office, located in country X, and selling such articles through  branch B, located in foreign country Y, and through branch C, located in  foreign country Z, for use outside country X. These activities  constitute the only activities of A Corporation for its taxable year  1963. Each such country levies an income tax on only the income derived  from sources within such country, and all income derived in 1963 by the  home office, branch B, and branch C, respectively, is derived from  sources within countries X, Y, and Z, respectively.

Moreover, by  applying subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph and by treating branch C  as though it were the only branch of A Corporation, branch C is treated  as a separate wholly owned subsidiary corporation of A Corporation, the  20 percent rate of tax on the income of such branch being less than 90  percent of, and at least 5 percentage points less than, the 50 percent  rate of tax which would apply to the income of branch C under the laws  of country X if, under the laws of such country, all the income of A  Corporation for 1963 derived through the home office and branch C were  derived from sources within country X. The income derived by branch B  and branch C, respectively, each treated as a separate corporation, from  the sale by or through each of them for use, consumption, or disposition  outside country Y and country Z, respectively, is treated as income from  the sale of personal property on behalf of A Corporation, a related  person, and constitutes foreign base company sales income for 1963.
