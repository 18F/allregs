                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A household shall live in the State in which it files an application for participation. The State agency may also require a household to file an application for participation in a specified project area (as defined in Sec. 271.2 of this chapter) or office within the State. No individual may participate as a member of more than one household or in more than one project area, in any month, unless an individual is a resident of a shelter for battered women and children as defined in Sec. 271.2 and was a member of a household containing the person who had abused him or her. Residents of shelters for battered women and children shall be handled in accordance with Sec. 273.11(g). The State agency shall not impose any durational residency requirements. The

State agency shall not require an otherwise eligible household to reside in a permanent dwelling or have a fixed mailing address as a condition of eligibility. Nor shall residency require an intent to reside permanently in the State or project area. Persons in a project area solely for vacation purposes shall not be considered residents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a household moves within the State, the State agency may require the household to reapply in the new project area or it may transfer the household's casefile to the new project area and continue the household's certification without reapplication. If the State agency chooses to transfer the case, it shall act on changes in household circumstances resulting from the move in accordance with Sec. 273.12(c) or Sec. 273.21. It shall also ensure that duplicate participation does not occur in accordance with Sec. 272.4(f) of this chapter, and that the transfer of a household's case shall not adversely affect the household.
