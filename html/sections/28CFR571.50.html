                            <p class="depth0">This subpart establishes procedures for processing a fine, or fine  and costs ordered by the court with respect to an inmate convicted of an  offense committed before November 1, 1987. When the court orders a  prisoner's confinement until payment of a fine, or fine and costs under  18 U.S.C. 3565, the Bureau of Prisons shall confine that inmate until  the fine, or fine and costs are paid, unless the inmate qualifies for  release under 18 U.S.C. 3569.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An inmate held on the sole basis of his/her inability to pay  such fine, or fine and costs, and whose non-exempt property does not  exceed $20.00 may request discharge from imprisonment on the basis of  indigency (see 18 U.S.C. 3569).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under 18 U.S.C. 3569, the determination of indigency may be made  by a U.S. Magistrate Judge. Where the U.S. Magistrate Judge makes a  finding of non-indigency based on the inmate's application for a  determination of his ability to pay the committed fine, or fine and  costs, staff shall refer the application to the appropriate United  States Attorney for the purpose of making a final decision on the  inmate's discharge under 18 U.S.C. 3569. It is to be noted that 18  U.S.C. 3569 provides for confining an inmate for nonpayment of a  committed fine, or fine and costs.  [63 FR 4357, Jan. 28, 1998]</p>
