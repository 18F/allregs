                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A clear and complete work statement concerning the area of  exploration (for basic research) or the end objectives (for development  and applied research) is essential. The work statement should allow  contractors freedom to exercise innovation and creativity. Work  statements must be individually tailored by technical and contracting  personnel to attain the desired degree of flexibility for contractor  creativity and the objectives of the R&D.;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In basic research the emphasis is on achieving specified  objectives and knowledge rather than on achieving predetermined end  results prescribed in a statement of specific performance  characteristics. This emphasis applies particularly during the early or  conceptual phases of the R&D; effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In reviewing work statements, contracting officers should ensure  that language suitable for a level-of-effort approach, which requires  the furnishing of technical effort and a report on the results, is not  intermingled with language suitable for a task-completion approach,  which often requires the   development of a tangible end item designed to achieve specific  performance characteristics. The wording of the work statement should  also be consistent with the type and form of contract to be negotiated  (see 16.207 and 16.306(d)). For example, the work statement for a cost- reimbursement contract promising the contractor's best efforts for a  fixed term would be phrased differently than a work statement for a  cost-reimbursement completion contract promising the contractor's best  efforts for a defined task. Differences between work statements for  fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursement contracts should be even  clearer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In preparing work statements, technical and contracting  personnel shall consider and, as appropriate, provide in the  solicitation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the area of exploration, tasks to be performed,  and objectives of the research or development effort;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Background information helpful to a clear understanding of the  objective or requirement (e.g., any known phenomena, techniques,  methodology, or results of related work);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information on factors such as personnel, environment, and  interfaces that may constrain the results of the effort;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reporting requirements and information on any additional items  that the contractor is required to furnish (at specified intervals) as  the work progresses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The type and form of contract contemplated by the Government  and, for level-of-effort work statements, an estimate of applicable  professional and technical effort involved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other considerations peculiar to the work to be performed;  for example, any design-to-cost requirements.</p>
