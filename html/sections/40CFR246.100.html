                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> These guidelines are applicable to the source separation of  residential, commercial, and institutional solid   wastes. Explicitly excluded are mining, agricultural, and industrial  solid wastes; hazardous wastes; sludges; construction and demolition  wastes; infectious wastes; classified waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ``Requirement'' sections contained herein delineate minimum  actions for Federal agencies for the recovery of resources from solid  waste through source separation. Pursuant to section 211 of the Solid  Waste Disposal Act, as amended, and Executive Order 11752 section 4(a),  the ``Requirement'' sections of these guidelines are mandatory for all  Federal agencies that generate solid waste. In addition, they are  recommended to State, interstate, regional, and local governments for  use in their activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ``Recommended Procedures'' sections are presented to suggest  actions or preferred methods by which the objectives of the requirements  can be realized. The ``Recommended Procedures'' are not mandatory for  Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>1 of  Executive Order 11752.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within one year after the effective date of these guidelines,  agencies shall make a final determination as to what actions shall be  taken to adopt the requirements of these guidelines and shall, within  two months of such determination, submit to the Administrator a schedule  of such actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Federal agencies that make the determination not to source  separate as described in Sec. Sec. 246.200-1, 246.201-1, and 246.202-1,  for whatever reason, shall make available to the Administrator the  analysis and rationale used in making that determination. The  Administrator shall publish notice of the availability of this report to  the general public in the Federal Register. The following are considered  to be valid reasons for not source separating under individual facts and  circumstances: inability to sell the recovered materials due to lack of  market, and costs so unreasonably high as to render source separation  for materials recovery economically impracticable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following points are to be covered in the report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of alternative actions considered with emphasis on  those alternatives which involve source separation for materials  recovery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of ongoing actions which will be continued and  new actions taken or proposed. This statement should identify all agency  facilities which will be affected by these actions including a brief  description of how such facilities will be affected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An analysis in support of the action chosen by the agency  including technical data, market studies, and policy considerations used  in arriving at such a determination.  In covering the points above, agencies should make every effort to  present information succinctly in a form easily understood, but in  sufficient detail so that the factors influencing the decision not to  source separate for materials recovery are clear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The above report shall be submitted to the Administrator as soon  as possible after a final agency determination has been made not to  adopt the requirements of these guidelines, but in no case later than  sixty days after such final determination. The Administrator will  indicate to the agency his concurrence/nonconcurrence with the agency's  decision, including his reason therefor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implementation of actions that would preclude source separation  for materials recovery shall be deferred, for sixty days where feasible,  in order to give the Administrator an opportunity to receive, analyze  and seek clarification of the above required report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is recommended that where the report required by Sec.  246.100(f) concerns an action for which an Environmental Impact  Statement (EIS) is required by the National Environmental Policy Act,  that the report be circulated together with the EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The report required under Sec. 246.100(e) and (f) shall be made  on   forms to be prescribed by the Administrator by notice in the Federal  Register.
