                                Sec. 30.315  May a claimant postpone a hearing?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FAB will entertain any reasonable request for scheduling the  time and place of the hearing, but such requests should be made at the  time that the hearing is requested. Scheduling is at the discretion of  the FAB, and is not reviewable. In most instances, once the hearing has  been scheduled and appropriate written notice has been mailed, it cannot  be postponed at the claimant's request for any reason except those  stated in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the FAB reviewer can  reschedule the hearing on the same docket (that is, during the same  hearing trip). If a request to postpone a scheduled hearing does not  meet one of the tests of paragraph (b) of this section and cannot be  accommodated on the same docket, no further opportunity for a hearing  will be provided. Instead, the FAB will consider the claimant's  objections by means of a review of the written record. In the  alternative, a teleconference may be substituted for the hearing at the  discretion of the reviewer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the claimant or the representative appointed by the  claimant in accordance with Sec. 30.600 of this part has a medical  reason that prevents attendance at the hearing, or where the   death or illness of the claimant's parent, spouse, or child prevents the  claimant from attending the hearing as scheduled, a postponement may be  granted in the discretion of the FAB if the claimant or the  representative provides at least 24 hours notice and a reasonable  explanation supporting his or her inability to attend the scheduled  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At any time after requesting a hearing, the claimant can request  a change to a review of the written record by making a written request  to the FAB. Once such a change is made, no further opportunity for a  hearing will be provided.</p>
