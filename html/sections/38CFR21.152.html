                                Sec. 21.152  Interpreter service for the hearing impaired.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The main purpose of interpreter service for the hearing  impaired is to facilitate instructor-student communication. VA will  provide interpreter service as necessary for the development and pursuit  of a rehabilitation program. This service will be provided if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A VA physician determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The veteran is deaf or his or her hearing is severely impaired;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All appropriate services and aids have been furnished to  improve the veteran's residual hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A VA physician determines that the veteran:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Can benefit from language and speech training; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agrees to undertake language and speech training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periods during which interpreter service may be provided.  Interpreter service may be furnished during:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial evaluation or reevaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extended evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rehabilitation to the point of employability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Independent living services; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employment services, including the first three months of  employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Selecting the interpreter. Only certified interpreters or  persons meeting generally accepted standards for interpreters shall  provide interpreter service. When an individual is not certified by a  State or professional association, VA shall seek the assistance of a  State certifying agency or a professional association in ascertaining  whether the individual is qualified to serve as an interpreter.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(14))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relatives. Interpreter service at VA expense may not be provided  by a relative of the veteran. The term relative has the same meaning as  under Sec. 21.374 pertaining to the use of relatives as attendants.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3492)</p>
