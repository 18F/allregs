                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A request should indicate the fee category. If the requester  does not indicate a fee category, or it is unclear to the FOIA office,  the FOIA office will make a determination of the fee category based on  the request. If the requester does not agree with their determination,  he/she will be afforded the opportunity to provide information to  support a different fee category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the request is submitted on behalf of another person or  organization (e.g., if an attorney is submitting a request on behalf of  a client), the fee category will be determined by considering the  underlying requester's identity and intended use of the information. The  following table outlines the basic fee categories and applicable fees:     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Requester category                  Search fees              Review fees            Duplication fees ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial use requester............  Yes.....................  Yes....................  Yes. Educational and non-commercial        No......................  No.....................

Representative of news media          No......................  No.....................

All other requesters................  Yes (first 2 hours        No.....................  Yes (first 100 pages,</p><p class="depth2">without charge).                                   or equivalent volume,</p><p class="depth2">without charge). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FOIA provides for three categories of requesters. However,  for clarity purposes, NASA has broken them down to four for the purposes  of determining fees. These four categories of FOIA requesters are:  Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific  institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other  requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these  categories, which is indicated in the FOIA fee table above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use requesters. When NASA receives a request for  documents appearing to be for commercial use, meaning a request from or  on behalf of one whom seeks information for a use or purpose that  furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of either the  requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, it will  assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for,  reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. NASA will not  consider a commercial-use request for a waiver or reduction of fees  based upon an assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest.  A request from a corporation (not a news media corporation) may be  presumed to be for commercial use unless the requester demonstrates that  it qualifies for a different fee category. Commercial use requesters are  not entitled to two (2) hours of search time or to 100 pages of  duplication of documents without charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Education and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show  that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a  qualifying institution and that the records are not being sought for a  commercial use (not operated for commerce, trade or profit), but are  being sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an  educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a  noncommercial scientific institution) research. A request for  educational purposes must be sent on the Institution's letterhead and  signed by the Dean of the School or Department. Records requested for  the intention of fulfilling credit requirements are not considered to be  sought for a scholarly purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of a non-commercial scientific institution, it  must be solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the  results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or  industry. Requests must be sent on the letterhead of the scientific  institution and signed by the responsible official in charge of the  project/program associated with the subject of the documents that are  being requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Representative of the news media. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NASA shall provide  documents to requesters in this category for the cost of duplication  alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages when the requester  demonstrates the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The requester's intended dissemination,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whether the information is current news and/or of public  interest, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Whether the information sought will shed new light on agency  statutory operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A representative of the news media is any person or entity  organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public that  actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the  public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a  distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. Examples of  news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast  ``news'' to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that  disseminate ``news'' and make their products available through a variety  of means to the general public. A request for records that supports the  news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to  be for a commercial use. ``Freelance'' journalists who demonstrate a  solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall  be considered as working for that entity. A publishing contract would  provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however,  NASA shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making  this determination. NASA's decision to grant a requester news media  status for the purposes of assessing fees will be made on a case-by-case  basis based upon the requesters intended use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requesters seeking this fee category who do not articulate  sufficient information to support their request will not be included in  this fee category. Additionally, FOIA staff may grant a partial fee  waiver if the requester can articulate the information above for some of  the documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other requesters. NASA shall charge requesters who do not  fit into any of the categories mentioned in this section fees in  accordance with the fee table above.</p>
