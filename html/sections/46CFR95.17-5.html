The arrangement of  piping shall be such as to give a uniform distribution over the entire  area protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where an installation is made to protect an oil fired boiler  installation on a flat which is open to or can drain to the lower  engineroom or other space, both the flat and the lower space shall be  protected simultaneously. The flat shall be fitted with suitable  coamings on all openings other than deck drains to properly restrain the  oil and foam at that level. Other installations of a similar nature will  be considered in a like manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a system is installed to protect a tank, it shall be so  designed and arranged as to spread a blanket of foam over the entire  liquid surface of the tank within the range of usual trim. The  arrangement of piping shall be such as to give a uniform distribution  over the entire area protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rate of application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For spaces other than tanks, the rate  of discharge to foam outlets protecting the hazard shall be at least as  set forth in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For chemical foam systems with stored ``A'' and ``B'' solutions,  a total of at least 1.6 gallons per minute of the two solutions shall be  discharged for each 10 square feet of area protected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For other types of foam systems, the water rate to the dry  powder generators or air foam production equipment shall be at least 1.6  gallons per minute for each 10 square feet of area protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For tanks, the rate of discharge to foam outlets protecting the  hazard shall be as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except  that the value of 1 gallon per minute shall be substituted in both cases  for the value of 1.6 gallons per minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supply of foam producing material. (1) There shall be provided a  quantity of foam producing material sufficient to operate the equipment  at the discharge rate specified in paragraph (b) of this section for a  period of at least 3 minutes for spaces other than tanks, and for at  least 5 minutes for tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Separate supply of foam agent.
