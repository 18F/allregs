                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from the particular subsections are justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (d) because access to information which has been  properly classified pursuant to an Executive Order could have an adverse  effect on the national security. In addition, from subsection (d)  because unauthorized access to certain investigatory material could  compromise ongoing or potential investigations; reveal the identity of  confidential informants; or constitute unwarranted invasions of the  personal privacy of third parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3), and (4) because the record of  proceeding constitutes an official record which includes transcripts of  quasi-judicial administrative proceedings, investigatory materials,  evidentiary materials such as exhibits, decisional memoranda, and other  case-related papers. Administrative due process could not be achieved by  the ex parte ``correction'' of such materials by the individual who is  the subject thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following system of records is exempted form 5 U.S.C.  552a(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  and (k)(2). To the extent that information in a record pertaining to an  individual does not relate to national defense or foreign policy,  official Federal investigations and/or law enforcement matters, the  exemption does not apply. In addition, where compliance would not appear  to interfere with or adversely affect the overall law or regulatory  enforcement process, the applicable exemption may be waived by the  Executive Office for Immigration Review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> is justified for the following  reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d)  because access to the records contained in this system of records could  inform the subject of the investigation of an actual or potential  criminal, civil, or regulatory violation or the existence of that  investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence  obtained as to the subject's activities; of the identity of confidential  sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and of information  that may enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These  factors would present a serious impediment to effective law and  regulatory enforcement where they prevent the successful completion of  the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources,  witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper  influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the  fabrication of testimony. In addition, granting access to such  information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business  information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion  of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to the records  could result in the release of properly classified information which  would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.  Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and  law enforcement activities and impose an enormous administrative burden  by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.
