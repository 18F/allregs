During equipment removal, they shall begin at the location of the last loading point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The two separate and distinct escapeways required by this section shall not end at a common shaft, slope, or drift opening, except that multiple compartment shafts or slopes separated by walls constructed of noncombustible material may be used as separate and distinct passageways.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each escapeway shall be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintained in a safe condition to always assure passage of anyone, including disabled persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clearly marked to show the route and direction of travel to the surface;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintained to at least a height of 5 feet from the mine floor to the mine roof, excluding the thickness of any

roof support, except that the escapeways shall be maintained to at least the height of the coalbed, excluding the thickness of any roof support, where the coalbed is less than 5 feet. In areas of mines where escapeways pass through doors, the height may be less than 5 feet, provided that sufficient height is maintained to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. In areas of mines developed before November 16, 1992, where escapeways pass over or under overcasts or undercasts, the height may be less than 5 feet provided that sufficient height is maintained to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency.

The cones must be placed within reach of the lifeline.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A branch line leading from the lifeline to a refuge alternative will be marked with a rigid spiraled coil at least eight inches in length.
