This criteria does not apply for materials that are unrelated to emission control performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fuel systems meet the running loss emission standard based on the same type of compliance demonstration specified in Sec.  1060.104(b), if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may subdivide a group of equipment or components that are identical under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section into different emission families if you show the expected emission characteristics are different during the useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In unusual circumstances, you may group equipment or components that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b) through (d) of this section into the same emission family if you show that their emission characteristics during the useful life will be similar. The provisions of this paragraph (f) do not exempt any engines or equipment from meeting all the applicable standards and requirements in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Emission families may include components used in multiple equipment categories. Such families are covered by a single certificate. For example, a single emission family may contain fuel tanks used in both Small SI equipment and Marine SI vessels.</p>
