The permittee shall conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The permittee shall emphasize underground coal mining and reclamation practices that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in flows in preference to the use of water treatment facilities prior to discharge to surface waters. Practices to control and minimize pollution include, but are not limited to, diverting water from underground workings or preventing water contact with acid- or toxic-forming materials, and minimizing water contact time with waste materials, maintaining mine barriers to enhance postmining inundation and sealing, establishing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, achieving quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, and lining drainage channels. If treatment is required to eliminate pollution of surface or ground waters, the permittee shall operate and maintain the necessary water treatment facilities as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Water quality standards and effluent limitations. (1) All surface drainage from the disturbed area, including disturbed areas that have been graded, seeded or planted and which remain subject to the requirements of this section, except for drainage from disturbed areas that have met the requirements of Sec. 717.20 shall be passed through a sedimentation pond or a series of sedimentation ponds prior to leaving the permit area.

For such discharges, the reporting requirements of this paragraph may be

satisfied by submitting to the regulatory authority on the same time schedule as required by the NPDES permit or within ninety (90) days following sample collection, whichever is earlier, either (1) a copy of the completed reporting form filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements, or (2) a letter identifying the State or Federal government official with whom the reporting form was filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements and the date of filing. In all cases in which analytical results of the sample collections indicate a violation of a permit condition or applicable standard has occurred, the operator shall notify the regulatory authority immediately. Where an NPDES permit effluent limitation requirement has been violated, the permittee should forward a copy of the Discharge Monitoring Report, EPA Form 3320-1, concurrently with notification of the violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment, structures, or other measures necessary to accurately measure and sample the quality and quantity of surface water discharges from the disturbed area of the permit area shall be properly installed, maintained and operated and shall be removed when no longer required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diversion and conveyance of overland flow away from disturbed areas.
