                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any point source  subject to this subpart must achieve, at a minimum, the following  effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction  attainable by application of the best practicable control technology  currently available (BPT).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Erosion and sediment controls. Design, install and maintain  effective erosion controls and sediment controls to minimize the  discharge of pollutants. At a minimum, such controls must be designed,  installed and maintained to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Control stormwater volume and velocity to minimize soil erosion  in order to minimize pollutant discharges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flowrates and  total stormwater volume, to minimize channel and streambank erosion and  scour in the immediate vicinity of discharge points;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction  activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Minimize sediment discharges from the site. The design,  installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must  address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of  precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil  characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes expected to  be present on the site;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide and maintain natural buffers around waters of the United  States, direct stormwater to vegetated areas and maximize stormwater  infiltration to reduce pollutant discharges, unless infeasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Minimize soil compaction. Minimizing soil compaction is not  required where the intended function of a specific area of the site  dictates that it be compacted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. Preserving topsoil is not  required   where the intended function of a specific area of the site dictates that  the topsoil be disturbed or removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Soil stabilization. Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a  minimum, be initiated immediately whenever any clearing, grading,  excavating or other earth disturbing activities have permanently ceased  on any portion of the site, or temporarily ceased on any portion of the  site and will not resume for a period exceeding 14 calendar days. In  arid, semiarid, and drought-stricken areas where initiating vegetative  stabilization measures immediately is infeasible, alternative  stabilization measures must be employed as specified by the permitting  authority. Stabilization must be completed within a period of time  determined by the permitting authority. In limited circumstances,  stabilization may not be required if the intended function of a specific  area of the site necessitates that it remain disturbed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dewatering. Discharges from dewatering activities, including  discharges from dewatering of trenches and excavations, are prohibited  unless managed by appropriate controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pollution prevention measures. Design, install, implement, and  maintain effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the  discharge of pollutants. At a minimum, such measures must be designed,  installed, implemented and maintained to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and vehicle  washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. Wash waters must be  treated in a sediment basin or alternative control that provides  equivalent or better treatment prior to discharge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimize the exposure of building materials, building products,  construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers,  pesticides, herbicides, detergents, sanitary waste and other materials  present on the site to precipitation and to stormwater. Minimization of  exposure is not required in cases where the exposure to precipitation  and to stormwater will not result in a discharge of pollutants, or where  exposure of a specific material or product poses little risk of  stormwater contamination (such as final products and materials intended  for outdoor use); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and  implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibited discharges. The following discharges are prohibited:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wastewater from washout of concrete, unless managed by an  appropriate control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form  release oils, curing compounds and other construction materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuels, oils, or other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment  operation and maintenance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Surface outlets. When discharging from basins and impoundments,  utilize outlet structures that withdraw water from the surface, unless  infeasible.
