                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee may not request or otherwise encourage the tender of a gift or decorations from a foreign government or official thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee may accept from a foreign government:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A gift which is in the nature of medical treatment or an educational scholarship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A tangible gift of minimal value tendered or received as a mark of courtesy; (``Minimal value'' means a retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of not more than one hundred dollars, unless the Administrator of the General Services Administration adjusts the value by regulation.) or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A tangible gift of more than minimal value when it appears that to refuse the gift would be likely to cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. However, the acceptance of such a gift would be on behalf of the United States and the gift would become the property of the United States. See the Department's General Administration Manual, Chapter 20-25 for information regarding the disposition of a gift accepted under these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee may also accept from a foreign government gifts of travel or expenses for travel (such as transportation, food and lodging) that take place entirely outside the United States and are of more than minimal value, if such acceptance is consistent with the interests of the United States and is approved by the travel approving authority in accordance with the Department's Travel Manual. See General Administration Manual, Chapter 20-25 for a requirement to report such travel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee may accept, retain, and wear a decoration tendered in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, subject to the approval of the Secretary or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Members of an employee's family and household are also subject to the regulations in this section. A member of an employee's family and household is a relative by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of the household. However, if a member of an employee's family and household is employed by another agency of the Government, the offer or acceptance of a gift shall be treated under the regulations of that agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For purposes of this section ``foreign government'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any unit of foreign government authority including any foreign national, state, local and municipal government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any international or multinational organization whose membership is composed of any unit of foreign government described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any agent or representative of any such unit or organization when acting as such agent or representative.
