A failure by the holder to make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty pursuant to VA Regulation 36.4286(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan. A good faith effort will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify the name and current or last address of the original veteran and any other liable obligors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify sufficient information (e.g., Social Security Number) to perform a routine trace inquiry through a major consumer credit bureau;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conducting the trace inquiry using an in-house credit reporting terminal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtaining the results of the inquiry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Mailing the required notices and concurrently providing the Secretary with the names and addresses of all obligors identified and sent notice; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Documentation of the holder's records.
