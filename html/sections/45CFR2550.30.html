                                Sec. 2550.30  How does a State decide whether to establish a State
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Although each State's chief executive officer has the authority  to select an administrative option, the Corporation strongly encourages  States to establish State Commissions which meet the requirements in  this part as quickly as possible. The requirements for State Commissions  were established to try to create informed and effective entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Corporation recognizes that some States, for legal or other  legitimate reasons, may not be able to meet all of the requirements of  the State Commissions. The AAE is essentially the same as a State  Commission; however, it may be exempt from some of the State Commission  requirements. A State that cannot meet one of the waivable requirements  of the State Commission (as explained in Sec. 2550.60), and which can  demonstrate this to the Corporation, should seek to establish an AAE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regardless of which entity a State employs, each State is  required to solicit broad-based, local input in an open, inclusive, non- political planning process.  [58 FR 60981, Nov. 18, 1993, as amended at 70 FR 39607, July 8, 2005]</p>
