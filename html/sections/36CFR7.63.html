                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial hauling. Ranchers and stockmen owning, leasing or  renting private lands, or holding grazing permits issued by the Bureau  of Land Management on designated grazing allotments adjacent to the  Artesia Entrance Road, Blue Mountain Road, and Deerlodge Park Road, are  authorized to use these roads for trucking or hauling ranching and  agricultural supplies and materials, including livestock, for use in  normal ranching and stock growing operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stock grazing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Privileges for the grazing of domestic  livestock based on authorized use of certain areas at the   time of approval of the act of September 8, 1960 (74 Stat. 857, Pub. L.  86-729), shall continue in effect or shall be renewed from time to time,  except for failure to comply with such terms and conditions as may be  prescribed by the Superintendent in these regulations and after  reasonable notice of default and subject to the following provisions of  tenure:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located  within the Monument shall not be withdrawn until title to the lands to  which such privileges are appurtenant shall have vested in the United  States except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable  thereto after reasonable notice of default.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located  outside the Monument shall not be withdrawn for a period of twenty-five  years after September 8, 1960, and thereafter shall continue during the  lifetime of the original permittee and his heirs if they were members of  his immediate family as described herein except for failure to comply  with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of  default.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Members of the immediate family are those persons who are  related to and directly dependent upon a person or persons, living on or  conducting grazing operations from lands, as of September 8, 1960, which  the National Park Service recognized as base lands appurtenant to  grazing privileges in the monument. Such interpretation excludes mature  children who, as of that date, were established in their own households  and were not directly dependent upon the base lands and appurtenant  grazing recognized by the National Park Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If title to base lands lying outside the monument is conveyed,  or such base lands are leased to someone other than a member of the  immediate family of the permittee as of September 8, 1960, the grazing  preference shall be recognized only for a period of twenty-five years  from September 8, 1960.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If title to a portion or part of the base land either outside or  inside the monument is conveyed or such base lands are leased, the new  owner or lessee will take with the land so acquired or leased after  September 8, 1960, such proportion of the entire grazing privileges as  the grazing capacity in animal unit months of the tract conveyed or  leased bears to the original area to which a grazing privilege was  appurtenant and recognized. Conveyance or lease of all such base lands  will automatically convey all grazing privileges appurtenant thereto.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Grazing privileges which are appurtenant to base lands located  either inside or outside the monument as of September 8, 1960, shall not  be conveyed separately therefrom.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where no reasonable ingress or egress is available to permittees  or nonpermittees who must cross monument lands to reach grazing  allotments or non-Federal lands within the exterior boundary of the  monument or adjacent thereto, the Superintendent will grant, upon  request, a temporary nonfee annual permit to herd stock on a designated  driveway which shall specify the time to be consumed in each single  drive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After September 8, 1960, no increase in the number of animal  unit months will be allowed on Federal lands in the monument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A permittee whose privileges are appurtenant to base lands  either inside or outside the monument may be granted total nonuse on a  year to year basis not to exceed three consecutive years. Total nonuse  beyond this time may be granted if necessitated for reasons clearly  outside the control of the permittee. Total unauthorized nonuse beyond  three consecutive years will result in the termination and loss of all  grazing privileges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever partial or total non-use is desired an application  must be made in writing to the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Grazing fees shall be the same as those approved for the Bureau  of Land Management and will be adjusted accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Permittees or nonpermittees who have stock on Federal lands  within the monument at any time or place, when or where herding or  grazing is unauthorized may be assessed fifty cents per day per cow or  horse and ten cents per day per sheep as damages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The Superintendent may accept a written relinquishment or waiver  of any privileges; however, no such relinquishment or waiver will be  effective without the written consent of the owner or owners of the base  lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Permits. Terms and conditions. The issuance and continued  effectiveness of all permits will be subject, in addition to mandatory  provisions required by Executive Order or law, to the following terms  and conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permittee and his employees shall use all possible care in  preventing forest and range fires, and shall assist in the extinguishing  of forest and range fires on, or within, the vicinity of the land  described in the permit, as well as in the preservation of good order  within the boundaries of the Monument.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Superintendent may require the permittee before driving  livestock to or from the grazing allotment to gather his livestock at a  designated time and place for the purpose of counting the same.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stock will be allowed to graze only on the allotment  designated in the permit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The permittee shall file with the Superintendent a copy of his  stock brand or other mark.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The permittee shall, upon notice from the Superintendent that  the allotment designated in the permit is not ready to be grazed at the  beginning of the designated grazing season, place no livestock on the  allotment for such a period as may be determined by the Superintendent  as necessary to avoid damage to the range. All, or a portion of the  livestock shall be removed from the area before the expiration of the  designated grazing season if the Superintendent determines further  grazing would be detrimental to the range. The number of stock and the  grazing period may be adjusted by the Superintendent at any time when  such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> No permit shall be issued or renewed until payment of all fees  and other amounts due the National Park Service has been made. Fees for  permits are due the National Park Service and must be paid at least 15  days in advance of the grazing period. No permit shall be effective to  authorize grazing use thereunder until all fees and other amounts due  the National Park Service have been paid. A pro rata adjustment of fees  will be made in the event of reduction of grazing privileges granted in  the permit, except that not more than 50 percent of the total annual  grazing fee will be refunded in the event reduced grazing benefits are  taken at the election of the permittee after his stock are on the range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> No building or other structure shall be erected nor shall  physical improvements of any kind be established under the permit except  upon plans and specifications approved by the National Park Service. Any  such facilities, structures, or buildings may be removed or disposed of  to a successor permittee within three months following the termination  of the permit; otherwise they shall become the property of the United  States without compensation therefor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The permittee shall utilize the lands covered by the permit  in a manner approved and directed by the Superintendent which will  prevent soil erosion thereon and on lands adjoining same.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The right is reserved to adjust the fees specified in the  permit at any time to conform with the fees approved for the Bureau of  Land Management, and the permittee shall be furnished a notice of any  change of fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> All livestock are considered as mature animals at 6 months of  age and are so counted in determining animal unit months and numbers of  animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> The Superintendent may prescribe additional terms and  conditions to meet individual cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall  be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of grazing  privileges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Appeals from the decision of the Superintendent to the Regional  Director, and from the Regional Director to the Director shall be made  in accordance with National Park Service Order No. 14, as amended (19 FR  8824) and Regional Director, Order No. 3, as amended (21 FR 1494).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as to prevent  the enforcement of the provisions of the General Rules and Regulations  and the   Special Rules and Regulations of the National Park Service or of any  other provisions of said rules and regulations applicable to stock  grazing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Snowmobiles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designated routes which will be open to  smowmobile use are approximately 20 miles of the Harpers Corner Road in  Colorado and approximately 2 miles of the Cub Creek Road in Utah. The  Harpers Corner Road section extends from the Plug Hat Overlook to the  Echo Park Road Turnoff. The Cub Creek Road section extends from the Chew  Ranch Road, 1 mile north of the Green River Bridge, to the point where  the Cub Creek Road leaves the southern boundary of the monument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On roads designated for snowmobile use, only that portion of the  road or parking area intended for other motor vehicle use may be used by  snowmobiles. Such roadway is available for snowmobile use only when  there is sufficient snow cover and when these roads are closed to all  other motor vehicle use by the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Snowmobile use outside designated routes is prohibited. The  superintendent shall determine the opening and closing dates for use of  the designated snowmobile routes each year.
