                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to manage the use and occupancy of the public lands for the development of locatable mineral deposits by limiting such use or occupancy to that which is reasonably incident. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will prevent abuse of the public lands while recognizing valid rights and uses under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.) and related laws governing the public lands, regardless of when those rights were created. BLM will take appropriate action to eliminate invalid uses, including unauthorized residential occupancy of the public lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This subpart applies to public lands BLM administers. They do not apply to state or private lands in which the mineral estate has been reserved to the United States. They do not apply to Federal lands administered by other Federal agencies, even though those lands may be subject to the operation of the mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart does not impair the right of any person to engage in recreational activities or any other authorized activity on public lands BLM administers.</p>
