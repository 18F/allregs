                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Board shall normally respond to requests in the  order of their receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acknowledgement of requests. On receipt of a request, the Board  shall send an acknowledgement letter or an e-mail confirming the  requestor's agreement to pay fees under Sec. 201.8 and providing a  request number for future reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time limits for responding to FOIA requests. The Board shall  make an initial determination to grant or deny a request for records  within 20 days (excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays) after the date  of receipt of the request, as described in Sec. 201.5(d), except as  stated in paragraph (f) of this section. Once the Board determines  whether it can grant a request entirely or in part, it shall notify the  requestor in writing. The Board shall advise the requestor of any fees  to be charged under Sec. 201.8 and shall disclose records promptly on  payment of the fees. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or  annotated to show the amount of information deleted unless doing so  would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The  location of the information deleted also shall be indicated on the  record when technically feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the statutory time limits for  processing a request cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances''  as defined in the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(6)(B)(iii)), the Board shall  promptly notify the requestor in writing, explaining the circumstances  and giving the date by which the request can be completed or if the  Board cannot complete the request. If the extension is for more than 10  working days, the Board shall provide the requestor with an opportunity  to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Modify the request so that it can be processed within the time  limit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Arrange an alternative time period for processing the original  request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Board believes that multiple requests submitted by a  requestor or by requestors acting in concert constitute a single request  that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and if the requests  involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple  requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals shall be taken  out of order and given expedited processing whenever it is determined  that they involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances that could reasonably be expected to pose an  imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  activity if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for expedited processing may be made either at the time  of the initial request or at a later time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for expedited processing must include a statement  explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For  example, a requestor under Sec. 201.8 must establish that his/her  professional activity is news reporting, although it need not be his/her  sole occupation. The requestor also must establish a particular urgency  to inform the public about government activity involved in the request,  beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited  processing, the Board shall decide whether to grant the request and  notify the requestor of its decision. If a request for expedited  treatment is granted, the request shall be processed as soon as  practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, an appeal  of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tolling of time limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board may toll the 20-day time  period to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make one request for additional information from the requester;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Clarify the applicability or amount of any fees, if necessary,  with the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tolling period ends upon the Board's receipt of information  from the requester or resolution of the fee issue.</p>
