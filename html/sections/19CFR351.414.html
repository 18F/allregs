                                Sec. 351.414  Comparison of normal value with export price
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section explains when and how the Secretary  will average prices in making comparisons of export price or constructed  export price with normal value. (See section 777A(d) of the Act.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of methods of comparison--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Average-to-average  method. The ``average-to-average'' method involves a comparison of the  weighted average of the normal values with the weighted average of the  export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable  merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transaction-to-transaction method. The ``transaction-to- transaction'' method involves a comparison of the normal values of  individual transactions with the export prices (or constructed export  prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Average-to-transaction method. The ``average-to-transaction''  method involves a comparison of the weighted average of the normal  values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual  transactions for comparable merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Choice of method. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an investigation or review, the  Secretary will use the average-to-average method unless the Secretary  determines another method is appropriate in a particular case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary will use the transaction-to-transaction method  only in unusual situations, such as when there are very few sales of  subject merchandise and the merchandise sold in each market is identical  or very similar or is custom-made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of the average-to-average method--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In  applying the average-to-average method, the Secretary will identify  those sales of the subject merchandise to the United States that are  comparable, and will include such sales in an ``averaging group.'' The  Secretary will calculate a weighted average of the export prices and the  constructed export prices of the sales included in the averaging group,  and will compare this weighted average to the weighted average of the  normal values of such sales.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of the averaging group. An averaging group will  consist of subject merchandise that is identical or virtually identical  in all physical characteristics and that is sold to the United States at  the same level of trade. In identifying sales to be included in an  averaging group, the Secretary also will take into account, where  appropriate, the region of the United States in which the merchandise is  sold, and such other factors as the Secretary considers relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time period over which weighted average is calculated. When  applying the average-to-average method in an investigation, the  Secretary normally will calculate weighted averages for the entire  period of investigation. However, when normal values, export prices, or  constructed export prices differ significantly over the course of the  period of investigation, the Secretary may calculate weighted averages  for such shorter period as the Secretary deems appropriate. When  applying the average-to-average method in a review, the Secretary  normally will calculate weighted averages on a monthly basis and compare  the weighted-average monthly export price or constructed export price to  the weighted-average normal value for the contemporaneous month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application of the average-to-transaction method--In applying  the average-to-transaction method in a review, when normal value is  based on the weighted average of sales of the foreign like product, the  Secretary will limit the averaging of such prices to sales incurred  during the contemporaneous month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contemporaneous Month. Normally, the Secretary will select as  the contemporaneous month the first of the following months which  applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The month during which the particular U.S. sales under  consideration were made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there are no sales of the foreign like product during this  month, the most recent of the three months prior to the month of the  U.S. sales in which there was a sale of the foreign like product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If there are no sales of the foreign like product during any of  these months, the earlier of the two months following the month of the  U.S. sales in which there was a sale of the foreign like product.
