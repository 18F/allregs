The handling of grapes for processing (raisins, crushing and other by-products) is exempt from requirements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section if the committee determines that the person handling such grapes has secured the appropriate permit or order from the County Agricultural Commissioner, and the by-product plant or packing plant to which the grapes are shipped has adequate facilities for commercial processing, grading, packing or manufacturing of by-products for resale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Suspension of packing holidays. Upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Secretary, the prohibition against packing or repacking grapes on any Saturday, Sunday or on Memorial Day or Independence Day holidays of each year, may be modified or suspended to permit the handling of grapes provided such handling complies with procedures and safeguards specified by the committee as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All requests for suspension of a packing holiday shall be in writing, shall state the reasons the suspension is being requested, and shall be submitted to the Committee manager by noon on Wednesday or at least 3 days prior to the requested suspension date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of a written request, the Committee manager shall promptly give reasonable notice to producers and handlers and to the Secretary that an assembled Committee meeting will be held to discuss the request(s).
