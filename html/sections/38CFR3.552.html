(See paragraph (k) of  this section for rules applicable to a veteran who establishes  entitlement to the aid and attendance allowance on or after date of  admission to hospitalization).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section. In addition, in pension  cases only, the aid and attendance allowance will be continued where the  pensionable disability is blindness (visual acuity \5/200\ or less) or  concentric contraction of visual field to 5 degrees or less. Awards are,  however, subject to the provisions of Sec.  3.551 (except where   the disabling condition is Hansen's disease) .</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional compensation for dependents under Sec.  3.4(b)(2) is  payable during hospitalization in addition to the rates authorized by  this section. The rates specified will also be increased by amounts  authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) based on independently ratable  disability, subject to the statutory ceiling on the total amount of  compensation payable as set forth in Sec.  3.350(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a veteran is admitted for hospitalization on or after  October 1, 1964, the additional compensation or increased pension for  aid and attendance will be discontinued effective the last day of the  month following the month in which the veteran is admitted for  hospitalization at the expense of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> will be discontinued  effective the last day of the month following the month in which the  veteran is admitted for hospitalization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a veteran affected by the provisions of paragraph (b) (1)  and (2) or paragraph (k) of this section is discharged or released from  the hospital against medical advice or as the result of disciplinary  action, and is readmitted to such hospitalization within 6 months after  that date, the allowance, additional compensation, or increased pension  will be discontinued effective the day preceding the date of  readmission. A readmission 6 months or more after such discharge or  release will be considered as a new admission.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(e))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction will not be made where the same monthly rate of  compensation would be payable without consideration of need for regular  aid and attendance. This can only be determined after careful review of  the current maximum entitlement without regard to any amount for aid and  attendance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where entitlement by reason of need for regular aid and  attendance is the basis of the monthly rate under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1) the  award will be reduced to the rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1114(p))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If entitlement is under section 1114(m), at the rate under 38  U.S.C. 1114(n).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If entitlement is under section 1114(n), the rate under 38  U.S.C. 1114(o) would be continued, since the disability previously  causing the need for regular aid and attendance would then be totally  disabling entitling the veteran to the maximum rate under 38 U.S.C.  1114(p).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If, because of blindness, a veteran requires regular aid and  attendance, but has better vision than ``light perception only'' the  award under 38 U.S.C. 1114(m) will be reduced while hospitalized to the  rate payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If the disability meets the aid and attendance requirements of  38 U.S.C. 1114(l) and the intermediate or next higher rate was assigned  for disability independently ratable at 50 percent or 100 percent, the  award based on such entitlement will be reduced because of  hospitalization to the amount payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The section 306 pension aid and attendance allowance authorized  by Sec.  3.252(f) is subject to reduction for hospitalization under the  provisions of this section in the same manner as the regular section 306  pension aid and attendance allowance.
