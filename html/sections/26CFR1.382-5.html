                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Following an ownership change, the section 382 limitation  for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of the loss  corporation multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies  with respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by  section 382 and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section  382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382  limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382  limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date),  section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years), and section 382(h)  (relating to recognized built-in gains and section 338 gains).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of value. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> does not apply to a  52-53 week taxable year that is less than 365 days unless a return is  required under section 443 (relating to short periods) for such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382  limitation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a loss corporation has two (or more)  ownership changes, any losses attributable to the period preceding the  earlier ownership change are treated as pre-change losses with respect  to both ownership changes. Thus, the later ownership change may result  in a lesser (but never in a greater) section 382 limitation with respect  to such losses. In any case, the amount of taxable income for any post- change year that can be offset by pre-change losses may not exceed the  section 382 limitation for such ownership change, reduced by the amount  of taxable income offset by pre-change losses subject to any earlier  ownership change(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recognized built-in gains and losses. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (d) applies to taxable years of a  loss corporation beginning on or after January 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Controlled groups. See Sec. 1.382-8 for rules for determining  the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. Except as otherwise provided, this section  applies to a loss corporation that has an ownership change to which  section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies.  [T.D. 8679, 61 FR 33316, June 27, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8825, 64 FR  36178, July 2, 1999]</p>
