In certain circumstances, the Secretary may determine normal value by constructing a value based on the cost of manufacture, selling general and administrative expenses, and profit. The Secretary may use constructed value as the basis for normal value where: neither the home market nor a third country market is viable; sales below the cost of production are disregarded; sales outside the ordinary course of trade, or sales the prices of which are otherwise unrepresentative, are disregarded; sales used to establish a fictitious market are disregarded; no contemporaneous sales of comparable merchandise are available; or in other circumstances where the Secretary determines that home market or third country prices are inappropriate. (See section 773(e) and section 773(f) of the Act.) This section clarifies the meaning of certain terms relating to constructed value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Profit and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In determining the amount to be added to constructed value for profit and for selling, general, and administrative expenses, the following rules will apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under section 773(e)(2)(A) of the Act, ``foreign country'' means the country in which the merchandise is produced or a third country selected by the Secretary under Sec. 351.404(e), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under section 773(e)(2)(B) of the Act, ``foreign country'' means the country in which the merchandise is produced.</p>
