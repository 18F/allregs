                                Sec. 1.1504-4  Treatment of warrants, options, convertible obligations,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. This section provides  regulations under section 1504(a)(5) (A) and (B) regarding the  circumstances in which warrants, options, obligations convertible into  stock, and other similar interests are treated as exercised for purposes  of determining whether a corporation is a member of an affiliated group.  The fact that an instrument may be treated as an option under these  regulations does not prevent such instrument from being treated as stock  under general principles of law. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)  of this section, this section applies to all provisions under the  Internal Revenue Code and the regulations to which affiliation within  the meaning of section 1504(a) (with or without the exceptions in  section 1504(b)) is relevant, including those provisions that refer to  section 1504(a)(2) (with or without the exceptions in section 1504(b))  without referring to affiliation, provided that the 80 percent voting  power and 80 percent value requirements of section 1504(a)(2) are not  modified therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(b)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Options not treated as stock or as excerised--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an option is not  considered either as stock or as exercised. Thus, options are  disregarded in determining whether a corporation is a member of an  affiliated group unless they are described in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Options treated as exercised--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Solely for  purposes of determining whether a corporation is a member of an  affiliated group, an option is treated as exercised if, on a measurement  date with respect to such option--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It could reasonably be anticipated that, if not for this  section, the issuance or transfer of the option in lieu of the issuance,  redemption, or transfer of the underlying stock would result in the  elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability (as  described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised (as  described in paragraph (g) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of options. All options with the same measurement  date are aggregated in determining whether the issuance or transfer of  an option in lieu of the issuance, redemption, or transfer of the  underlying stock would result in the elimination of a substantial amount  of federal income tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of treating option as exercised--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An  option that is treated as exercised is treated as exercised for purposes  of determining the percentage of the value of stock owned by the holder  and other parties, but is not treated as exercised for purposes of  determining the percentage of the voting power of stock owned by the  holder and other parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cash settlement options, phantom stock, stock appreciation  rights, or similar interests. If a cash settlement option, phantom  stock, stock appreciation right, or similar interest is treated as  exercised, the option is treated as having been converted into stock of  the issuing corporation. If the amount to be received upon the exercise  of such an option is determined by reference to a multiple of the  increase in the value of a share of the issuing corporation's stock on  the exercise date over the value of a share of the stock on the date the  option is issued, the option is treated as converted into a  corresponding number of shares of such stock. Appropriate adjustments  must be made in any situation in which the amount to be received upon  exercise of the option is determined in another manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Valuation. For purposes of section 1504(a)(2)(B) and this  section, all shares of stock within a single class are considered to  have the same value. Thus, control premiums and minority and blockage  discounts within a single class are not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation P owns all 100 shares of the common stock  of Corporation S, the only class of S stock outstanding. Each share of S  stock has a fair market value of $10 and has one vote. On June 30, 1992,  P issues to Corporation X an option to acquire 80 shares of the S stock  from P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, under the provisions of this section, the option is treated  as exercised, then, solely for purposes of determining affiliation, P is  treated as owning only 20 percent of the value of the outstanding S  stock and X is treated as owing the remaining 80 percent of the value of  the S stock. P is still treated as owning all of the voting power of S.  Accordingly, because P is treated as owning less than 80 percent of the  value of the outstanding S stock, P and S are no longer affiliated.  However, because X is not treated as owning any of the voting power of  S, X and S are also not affiliated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issuing corporation. ``Issuing corporation'' means the  corporation whose stock is subject to an option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Related or sequential option. ``Related or sequential option''  means an option that is one of a series of options issued to the same or  related persons. For purposes of this section, any options issued to the  same person or related persons within a two-year period are presumed to  be part of a series of options. This presumption may be rebutted if the  facts and circumstances clearly establish that the options are not part  of a series of options. Any options issued to the same person or related  persons more than two years apart are presumed not to be part of a  series of options. This presumption may be rebutted if the facts and  circumstances clearly establish that the options are part of a series of  options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Related persons. Persons are related if they are related within  the meaning of section 267(b) (without the application of sections  267(c) and 1563(e)(1)) or 707(b)(1), substituting ``10 percent'' for  ``50 percent'' wherever it appears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Measurement date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. ``Measurement date'' means a  date on which an option is issued or transferred or on which the terms  of an existing option or the underlying stock are adjusted (including an  adjustment pursuant to the terms of the option or the underlying stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Issuances, transfers, or adjustments not treated as measurement  dates. A measurement date does not include a date on which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An option is issued or transferred by gift, at death, or between  spouses or former spouses under section 1041;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An option is issued or transferred--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Between members of an affiliated group (determined with the  exceptions in section 1504(b) and without the application of this  section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Between persons none of which is a member of the affiliated  group (determined without the exceptions in section 1504(b) and without  the application of this section), if any, of which the issuing  corporation is a member, unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any such person is related to (or acting in concert with) the  issuing corporation or any member of its affiliated group; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The issuance or transfer is pursuant to a plan a principal  purpose of which is to avoid the application of section 1504 and this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An adjustment occurs in the terms or pursuant to the terms of an  option or the underlying stock that does not materially increase the  likelihood that the option will be exercised; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A change occurs in the exercise price of an option or in the  number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to the  option as determined by a bona fide, reasonable, adjustment formula that  has the effect of preventing dilution of the interests of the holders of  the options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> is made for a  principal purpose of increasing the likelihood that an option will be  exercised, a measurement date also includes any date on which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The capital structure of the issuing corporation is changed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair market value of the stock of the issuing corporation is  altered through a transfer of assets to or from the issuing corporation  (other than regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Measurement date for options issued pursuant to a plan. In the  case of options issued pursuant to a plan, a measurement date for any of  the options constitutes a measurement date for all options issued  pursuant to the plan that are outstanding on the measurement date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Measurement date for related or sequential options. In the case  of related or sequential options, a measurement date for any of the  options constitutes a measurement date for all related or sequential  options that are outstanding on the measurement date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section  may be illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation P owns all 80 shares of the common stock of  Corporation S, the only class of S stock outstanding. On January 1,  1992, S issues a warrant, exercisable within 3 years, to U, an unrelated  corporation, to acquire 10 newly issued shares of S common stock. On  July 1, 1992, S issues a second warrant to U to acquire 10 additional  newly issued shares of S common stock. On January 1, 1993, S issues a  third warrant to T, a wholly owned subsidiary of U, to acquire 10 newly  issued shares of S common stock. Assume that the facts and circumstances  do not clearly establish that the options are not part of a series of  options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> January 1, 1992, July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1993, constitute  measurement dates for the first warrant, the second warrant, and the  third warrant, respectively, because the warrants were issued on those  dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the first and second warrants were issued within two  years of each other, and both warrants were issued to U, the warrants  constitute related or sequential options. Accordingly, July 1, 1992,  constitutes a measurement date for the first warrant as well as for the  second warrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Because the first, second, and third warrants were all issued  within two years of each other, and were all issued to the same or  related persons, the warrants constitute related or sequential options.  Accordingly, January 1, 1993, constitutes a measurement date for the  first and second warrants, as well as for the third warrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In-the-money. ``In-the-money'' means the exercise price of the  option is less than (or in the case of an option to sell stock, greater  than) the fair market value of the underlying stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Options--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Instruments treated as options. For purposes of  this section, except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph  (d), the following are treated as options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A call option, warrant, convertible obligation, put option,  redemption agreement (including a right to cause the redemption of  stock), or any other instrument that provides for the right to issue,  redeem, or transfer stock (including an option on an option); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A cash settlement option, phantom stock, stock appreciation  right, or any other similar interest (except for stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instruments generally not treated as options. For purposes of  this section, the following will not be treated as options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Options on section 1504(a)(4) stock. Options on stock described  in section 1504(a)(4);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain publicly traded options--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Options  which on the measurement date are traded on (or subject to the rules of)  a qualified board or exchange as defined in section 1256(g)(7), or on  any other exchange, board of trade, or market specified by   the Internal Revenue Service in regulations, a revenue ruling, or  revenue procedure. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not  apply to options issued, transferred, or listed with a principal purpose  of avoiding the application of section 1504 and this section. For  example, a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 1504  and this section may exist if warrants, convertible or exchangeable debt  instruments, or other similar instruments have an exercise price (or, in  the case of convertible or exchangeable instruments, a conversion or  exchange premium) that is materially less than, or a term that is  materially longer than, those that are customary for publicly traded  instruments of their type. A principal purpose may also exist if a large  percentage of an issuance of an instrument is placed with one investor  (or group of investors) and a very small percentage of the issuance is  traded on a qualified board or exchange;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stock purchase agreements. Stock purchase agreements or  similar arrangements whose terms are commercially reasonable and in  which the parties' obligations to complete the transaction are subject  only to reasonable closing conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Escrow, pledge, or other security agreements. Agreements for  holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or other security agreement  that are part of a typical commercial transaction and that are subject  to customary commercial conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Compensatory options--(A) General rule. Stock appreciation  rights, warrants, stock options, phantom stock, or other similar  instruments provided to employees, directors, or independent contractors  in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a  related corporation (and that is not excessive by reference to the  services performed) and which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Are nontransferable within the meaning of Sec. 1.83-3(d); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined  in Sec. 1.83-7(b) on the measurement date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions. (1) Paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not  apply to options issued or transferred with a principal purpose of  avoiding the application of section 1504 and this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(v)(A)</em> of this section ceases to apply to  options that become transferable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> ceases to apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Options created pursuant to a title 11 or similar case.  Options created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances to a plan  of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of  section 368(a)(3)(A)), the option created by the confirmation of the  plan, and any option created under the plan prior to the time the plan  becomes effective;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Convertible preferred stock. Convertible preferred stock,  provided the terms of the conversion feature do not permit or require  the tender of any consideration other than the stock being converted;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Other enumerated instruments. Any other instruments specified  by the Internal Revenue Service in regulations, a revenue ruling, or  revenue procedure. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Elimination of federal income tax liability. For purposes of  this section, the elimination of federal income tax liability includes  the elimination or deferral of federal income tax liability. In  determining whether there is an elimination of federal income tax  liability, the tax consequences to all involved parties are considered.  Examples of elimination of federal income tax liability include the use  of a loss or deduction that would not otherwise be utilized, the  acceleration of a loss or deduction to a year earlier than the year in  which the loss or deduction   would otherwise be utilized, the deferral of gain or income to a year  later than the year in which the gain or income would otherwise be  reported, and the acceleration of gain or income to a year earlier than  the year in which the gain or income would otherwise be reported, if  such gain or income is offset by a net operating loss or net capital  loss that would otherwise expire unused. The elimination of federal  income tax liability does not include the deferral of gain with respect  to the stock subject to the option that would be recognized if such  stock were sold on a measurement date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Substantial amount of federal income tax liability. The  determination of what constitutes a substantial amount of federal income  tax liability is based on all the facts and circumstances, including the  absolute amount of the elimination, the amount of the elimination  relative to overall tax liability, and the timing of items of income and  deductions, taking into account present value concepts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reasonable certainty of exercise--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally. The  determination of whether, as of a measurement date, an option is  reasonably certain to be exercised is based on all the facts and  circumstances, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purchase price. The purchase price of the option in absolute  terms and in relation to the fair market value of the stock or the  exercise price of the option;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In-the-money option. Whether and to what extent the option is  in-the-money on the measurement date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not in-the-money option. If the option is not in-the-money on  the measurement date, the amount or percentage by which the exercise  price of the option is greater than (or in the case of an option to sell  stock, is less than) the fair market value of the underlying stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exercise price. Whether the exercise price of the option is  fixed or fluctuates depending on the earnings, value, or other  indication of economic performance of the issuing corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Time of exercise. The time at which, or the period of time  during which, the option can be exercised;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Related or sequential options. Whether the option is one in a  series of related or sequential options;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Stockholder rights. The existence of an arrangement (either  within the option agreement or in a related agreement) that, directly or  indirectly, affords managerial or economic rights in the issuing  corporation that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the issuing  corporation's stock (e.g., voting rights, dividend rights, or rights to  proceeds on liquidation) to the person who would acquire the stock upon  exercise of the option or a person related to such person. For this  purpose, managerial or economic rights in the issuing corporation  possessed because of actual stock ownership in the issuing corporation  are not taken into account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Restrictive covenants. The existence of restrictive covenants  or similar arrangements (either within the option agreement or in a  related agreement) that, directly or indirectly, prevent or limit the  ability of the issuing corporation to undertake certain activities while  the option is outstanding (e.g., covenants limiting the payment of  dividends or borrowing of funds);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Intention to alter value. Whether it was intended that through  a change in the capital structure of the issuing corporation or a  transfer of assets to or from the issuing corporation (other than  regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other means, the fair market  value of the stock of the issuing corporation would be altered for a  principal purpose of increasing the likelihood that the option would be  exercised; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Contingencies. Any contingency (other than the mere passage of  time) to which the exercise of the option is subject (e.g., a public  offering of the issuing corporation's stock or reaching a certain level  of earnings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cash settlement options, phantom stock, stock appreciation  rights, or similar interests. A cash settlement option, phantom stock,  stock appreciation right, or similar interest is treated as reasonably  certain to be exercised if it is reasonably certain that the option will  have value at some time during the period in which the option may be  exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Options to acquire stock. Except as provided  in paragraph   (g)(3)(iv) of this section, an option to acquire stock is not considered  reasonably certain, as of a measurement date, to be exercised if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The option may be exercised no more than 24 months after the  measurement date and the exercise price is equal to or greater than 90  percent of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the  measurement date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms of the option provide that the exercise price of the  option is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the  underlying stock on the exercise date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Options to sell stock. Except as provided in paragraph  (g)(3)(iv) of this section, an option to sell stock is not considered  reasonably certain, as of a measurement date, to be exercised if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The option may be exercised no more than 24 months after the  measurement date and the exercise price is equal to or less than 110  percent of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the  measurement date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The terms of the option provide that the exercise price of the  option is equal to or less than the fair market value of the underlying  stock on the exercise date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Options exercisable at fair market value. For purposes of  paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, an option  whose exercise price is determined by a formula is considered to have an  exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on  the exercise date if the formula is agreed upon by the parties when the  option is issued in a bona fide attempt to arrive at fair market value  on the exercise date and is to be applied based upon the facts in  existence on the exercise date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exceptions. The safe harbors of this paragraph (g)(3) do not  apply if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An arrangement exists that provides the holder or a related  party with stockholder rights described in paragraph (g)(1)(vii) of this  section (except for rights arising upon a default under the option or a  related agreement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is intended that through a change in the capital structure of  the issuing corporation or a transfer of assets to or from the issuing  corporation (other than regular, ordinary dividends) or by any other  means, the fair market value of the stock of the issuing corporation  will be altered for a principal purpose of increasing the likelihood  that the option will be exercised; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The option is one in a series of related or sequential options,  unless all such options satisfy paragraph (g)(3) (i) or (ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Failure to satisfy safe harbor. Failure of an option to satisfy  one of the safe harbors of this paragraph (g)(3) does not affect the  determination of whether an option is treated as reasonably certain to  be exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples. These examples assume that the measurement dates  set forth in the examples are the only measurement dates that have taken  place or will take place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P is the common parent of a consolidated group,  consisting of P, S, and T. P owns all 100 shares of S's only class of  stock, which is voting common stock. P also owns all the stock of T. On  June 30, 1992, when the fair market value of the S stock is $40 per  share, P sells to U, an unrelated corporation, an option to acquire 40  shares of the S stock that P owns at an exercise price of $30 per share,  exercisable at any time within 3 years after the granting of the option.  P and T have had substantial losses for 5 consecutive years while S has  had substantial income during the same period. Because P, S, and T have  been filing consolidated returns, P and T have been able to use all of  their losses to offset S's income. It is anticipated that P, S, and T  will continue their earnings histories for several more years. On July  31, 1992, S declares and pays a dividend of $1 per share to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If P, S, and T continue to file consolidated returns after June  30, 1992, it could reasonably be anticipated that P, S, and T would  eliminate a substantial amount of federal income tax liability by using  P's and T's future losses to offset S's income in consolidated returns.  Furthermore, based on the difference between the exercise price of the  option and the fair market value of the S stock, it is reasonably  certain, on June 30, 1992, a measurement date, that the option will be  exercised. Therefore, the option held by U is treated as exercised. As a  result, for purposes of determining whether P and S are affiliated, P is  treated as owning only 60 percent of the value of outstanding shares of  S stock and U is treated as owning the remaining 40 percent. P is still  treated as owning 100 percent of the voting power. Because   members of the P group are no longer treated as owning stock possessing  80 percent of the total value of the S stock as of June 30, 1992, S is  no longer a member of the P group. Additionally, P is not entitled to a  100 percent dividends received deduction under section 243(a)(3) because  P and S are also treated as not affiliated for purposes of section 243.  P is only entitled to an 80 percent dividends received deduction under  section 243(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that  rather than P issuing an option to acquire 40 shares of S stock to U on  June 30, 1992, P, pursuant to a plan, issues an option to U1 on July 1,  1992, to acquire 20 shares of S stock, and issues an option to U2 on  July 2, 1992, to acquire 20 shares of S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the options issued to U1 and U2 were issued pursuant to  a plan, July 2, 1992, constitutes a measurement data for both options.  Therefore, both options are aggregated in determining whether the  issuance of the options, rather than the sale of the S stock, would  result in the elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax  liability. Accordingly, as in Example 1, because the continued  affiliation of P, S, and T could reasonably be anticipated to result in  the elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability  and the options are reasonably certain to be exercised, the options are  treated as exercised for purposes of determining whether P and S are  affiliated, and P and S are no longer affiliated as of July 2, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that  the option gives U the right to acquire all 100 shares of the S stock,  and U is the common parent of a consolidated group. The U group has had  substantial losses for 5 consecutive years and it is anticipated that  the U group will continue its earnings history for several more years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If P sold the S stock, in lieu of the option, to U, S would  become a member of the U group. Because the U group files consolidated  returns, if P sold the S stock to U, U would be able to use its future  losses to offset future income of S. When viewing the transaction from  the effect on all parties, the sale of the option, in lieu of the  underlying S stock, does not result in the elimination of federal income  tax liability because S's income would be offset by the losses of  members of either the P or U group. Accordingly, the option is  disregarded and S remains a member of the P group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P is the common parent of a consolidated group,  consisting of P and S. P owns 90 of the 100 outstanding shares of S's  only class of stock, which is voting common stock, and U, an unrelated  corporation, owns the remaining 10 shares. On August 31, 1992, when the  fair market value of the S stock is $100 per share, P sells a call  option to U that entitles U to purchase 20 shares of S stock from P, at  any time before August 31, 1993, at an exercise price of $115 per share.  The call option does not provide U with any voting rights, dividend  rights, or any other managerial or economic rights ordinarily afforded  to owners of the S stock. There is no intention on August 31, 1992, to  alter the value of S to increase the likelihood of the exercise of the  call option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the exercise price of the call option is equal to or  greater than 90 percent of the fair market value of the S stock on  August 31, 1992, a measurement date, the option may be exercised no more  than 24 months after the measurement date, and none of the items  described in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section that preclude  application of the safe harbor are present, the safe harbor of paragraph  (g)(3)(i) of this section applies and the call option is treated as if  it is not reasonably certain to be exercised. Therefore, regardless of  whether the continued affiliation of P and S would result in the  elimination of a substantial amount of federal income tax liability, the  call option is disregarded in determining whether S remains a member of  the P group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that  the call option gives U the right to vote similar to that of a  shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section, the safe harbor of  paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not apply because the call  option entitles U to voting rights equivalent to that of a shareholder.  Accordingly, all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the sale of  the call option must be taken into consideration in determining whether  it is reasonably certain that the call option will be exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1992, two unrelated corporations, X and Y, decide  to engage jointly in a new business venture. To accomplish this purpose,  X organizes a new corporation, S, on September 30, 1992. X acquires 100  shares of the voting common stock of S, which are the only shares of S  stock outstanding. Y acquires a debenture of S which is convertible, on  September 30, 1995, into 100 shares of S common stock. If the conversion  right is not exercised, X will have the right, on September 30, 1995, to  put 50 shares of its S stock to Y in exchange for 50 percent of the  debenture held by Y. The likelihood of the success of the venture is  uncertain. It is anticipated that S will generate substantial losses in  its early years of operation. X expects to have substantial taxable  income during the three years following the organization of S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the terms of this arrangement, it is reasonably certain  on September 30, 1992, a measurement date, that on September 30, 1995,  either through Y's exercise of its conversion right or X's right to put  S stock to   Y, that Y will own 50 percent of the S stock. Additionally, it could  reasonably be anticipated, on September 30, 1992, a measurement date,  that the affiliation of X and S would result in the elimination of a  substantial amount of federal income tax liability. Accordingly, for  purposes of determining whether X and S are affiliated, X is treated as  owning only 50 percent of the value of the S stock as of September 30,  1992, a measurement date, and S is not a member of the X affiliated  group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that  rather than acquiring 100 percent of the S stock and the right to put S  stock to Y, X acquires only 80 percent of the S stock, while S, rather  than acquiring a convertible debenture, acquires 20 percent of the S  stock, and an option to acquire an additional 30 percent of the S stock.  The terms of the option are such that the option will only be exercised  if the new business venture succeeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In contrast to Example 6, because of the true business risks  involved in the start-up of S and whether the business venture will  ultimately succeed, along with the fact that X does not have an option  to put S stock to Y, it is not reasonably certain on September 30, 1992,  a measurement date, that the option will be exercised and that X will  only own 50 percent of the S stock on September 30, 1995. Accordingly,  the option is disregarded in determining whether S is a member of the X  group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective date.

This section does not  apply to options issued prior to February 28, 1992, which have a  measurement date on or after February 28, 1992, if the measurement date  for the option occurs solely because of an adjustment in the terms of  the option pursuant to the terms of the option as it existed on February  28, 1992.

A, B, and C are the members of an affiliated group of  corporations (as defined in section 1504), and all use the calendar year  as their taxable year. For 1983, A, B, and C file a consolidated return.  ABC has United States source income of $1,000 and foreign source losses  (overall foreign loss) of $400. In accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i)  of this section, ABC adds $400 to its consolidated overall foreign loss  account at the end of 1983. For 1983, the separate foreign source  taxable income (or loss) of A is $400, of B is ($200), and of C is  ($600). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, B and C must establish  separate notional overall foreign loss accounts. Under paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the amount added to each notional account  is the pro rata share of the consolidated overall foreign loss of each  member contributing to such loss. The pro rata share is determined by  multiplying the consolidated loss by the member's proportionate share of  the total foreign source losses of all members having such losses. B's  foreign source loss if $200 and C's foreign source loss is $600,  totaling $800. B must add $400x200/800, or $100, to its notional overall  foreign loss account. C must add $400x600/800, or $300, to its notional  overall foreign loss account.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The facts are the same as in example (1). In 1984, ABC  has consolidated foreign source taxable income of $200. Under paragraph  (d) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-2, ABC is required to recapture  $100 of the amount in its consolidated overall foreign loss account,  which reduces that account by $100 under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section. In accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, B  reduces its notional account by $100x100/400, or $25, and C reduces it  notional account by $100x300/400, or $75. At the end of 1984 ABC has  $300 in its consolidated overall foreign loss account, B has $75 in its  notional account, and C has $225 in its notional account.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). D and E are members of an affiliated group and file  separate returns using the calendar year as their taxable year for 1980.  In 1980, D has an overall foreign loss of $200, which it adds to its  overall foreign loss account, and E has no overall foreign losses. For  1981, D and E file a consolidated return, and DE must establish a  consolidated overall foreign loss account, to which D's overall foreign  loss from 1980 is added under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. D  also adds the same amount $200 to its notional account under paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section. In 1981, DE has consolidated foreign  source taxable income of $300. Since the amount added to the  consolidated overall foreign loss account in 1981 is treated as a  consolidated overall foreign loss from 1980, DE must recapture $150 in  1981 under paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-2. DE's  consolidated overall foreign loss account is reduced by $150 under  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and D's notional account is  reduced by $150 under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, leaving  balances of $50 in each of those accounts at the end of 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). F and G are not members of an affiliated group in 1980,  and G has an overall foreign loss of $200, which it adds to its overall  foreign loss account. F has no overall foreign loss. On January 1, 1981,  F acquires G, and FG files a consolidated return for the calendar year  1981. In 1981, F has no foreign source taxable income or loss, and G has  $100 of foreign source taxable income. FG's consolidated foreign source  taxable income, $100, minus such income without G's items of income and  deduction, $0, is $100. Therefore 50% of that amount, $50, of G's  overall foreign loss from its 1980 separate return limitation year is  added to FG's consolidated overall foreign loss account under paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section, and the same amount is added to G's  notional account under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section. In  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-2, FG  must recapture the $50 balance in its consolidated overall foreign loss  account in 1981 because the amount   added from G's separate return limitation year is treated as a 1980  consolidated overall foreign loss. At the end of 1981, FG has a balance  of $0 in its consolidated overall foreign loss account, G has $0 in its  notional account, and G also has $150 remaining from its 1980 overall  foreign loss that has not yet been added to the consolidated overall  foreign loss account.</p><p class="depth0">On January 1, 1982, F sells G and G leaves the affiliated group.  Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, G takes with it the balance  in its overall foreign loss account from 1980 (its prior separate return  limitation year) that has not been added to the consolidated account. G  has $150 of overall foreign loss in its overall foreign loss account.  Because the amount in the consolidated overall foreign loss account is  zero, no amount from that account is allocated to G.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1982 corporation H has United States source  income of $300 and foreign source losses of $500, resulting in a net  operating loss of $200 and a balance in H's overall foreign loss account  at the end of 1982 of $300.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On January 1, 1983, H is acquired by J, and for the calendar  year 1983 JH files a consolidated return.

This net operating loss deduction is $100 of H's $200  net operating loss from 1982 (a separate return limitation year), which  is limited by Sec. 1.1502-21A(c). For 1983, H has separate taxable  income of $100, comprised of $100 of United States source taxable income  and zero foreign source taxable income, and J has separate taxable  income of $700, comprised of $700 of United States source taxable income  and zero foreign source taxable income. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, H adds $100 to its separate overall foreign loss account, since  that amount of its net operating loss has reduced United States source  income.

Therefore, under paragraph (d) of this section and  Sec. 1.904(f)-2 JH also recaptures this $100, reducing the consolidated  overall foreign loss account to $0. H has $300 remaining in its separate  overall foreign loss account at the end of 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In 1985, H has separate taxable income of $400, comprised of  $100 of United States source taxable income and $300 of foreign source  taxable income. J has separate taxable income of $300 comprised of $600  of United States source taxable income and $300 of foreign source  losses. JH has consolidated taxable income of $700, all of which is  United States source. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section an  additional $150 from H's separate overall foreign loss is added to the  consolidated overall foreign loss account, computed as follows:  Consolidated foreign source taxable income.................           $0 Consolidated foreign source taxable income recomputed by          -(300)</p><p class="depth0">excluding H's foreign source income and deductions........</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">300.....................................................</p><p class="depth0">x 50%....................................................         $150 Amount from H's separate return limitation year overall             $150</p><p class="depth0">foreign loss account added to the consolidated overall</p><p class="depth0">foreign loss account......................................</p><p class="depth0">Thus, an additional $150 of H's separate overall foreign loss is added  to the consolidated overall foreign loss account, and, under paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the same amount is added to J's notional  account. While this amount is subject to recapture beginning in the same  taxable year, JH has no consolidated foreign source taxable income in  1985, so no overall foreign loss is recaptured. H has a remaining  balance of $150 in its separate return limitation year overall foreign  loss account and HJ has $150 in its consolidated overall foreign loss  account.</p><p class="depth0">Example (6).

Built-in  deductions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) for a  taxable year shall be subject to the limitation of Sec. 1.1502-21A(c)  (determined without regard to such deductions and without regard to net  operating loss carryovers to such year) and the limitation of  Sec. 1.1502-22A(c) (determined without regard to such deductions and  without regard to capital loss carryovers to such year). If as a result  of applying such limitations, built-in deductions are not allowable in  such consolidated return year, such deductions shall be treated as a net  operating loss or net capital loss (as the case may be) sustained in  such year and shall be carried to those taxable years (consolidated or  separate) to which a consolidated net operating loss or a consolidated  net capital loss could be carried under Secs. 1.1502-21A, 1.1502-22A and  1.1502-79A, (or Secs. 1.1502-21T and 1.1502-22T, as appropriate) except  that such losses shall be treated as losses subject to the limitations  contained in Secs. 1.1502-21T(c) or 1.1502-22T(c) (or Secs. 1.1502- 21A(c), 1.1502-22A(c), as appropriate), as the case may be. Thus, for  example, if member X sells a capital asset during a consolidated return  year at a $1,000 loss and such loss is treated as a built-in deduction,  then such loss shall be subject to the limitation contained in  Sec. 1.1502-22(c), which, in general, would allow such loss to be offset  only against X's own capital gain net income (net capital gain for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977). Assuming X had no  capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning  before January 1, 1977) reflected in such year (after taking into  account its capital losses, other than capital loss carryovers and the  built-in deduction), such $1,000 loss shall be treated as a net capital  loss and shall be carried over for 5 years under Sec. 1.1502-22, subject  to the limitation contained in Sec. 1.1502-22(c) for consolidated return  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Built-in deductions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, the  term ``built-in deductions'' for a consolidated return year means those  deductions or losses of a corporation which are recognized in such year,  or which are recognized in a separate return year and carried over in  the form of a net operating or net capital loss to such year, but which  are economically accrued in a separate return limitation year (as  defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(f)). Such term does not include deductions or  losses incurred in rehabilitating such corporation. Thus, for example,  assume P is the common parent of a group filing consolidated returns on  the basis of a calendar year and that P purchases all of the stock of S  on December 31, 1966. Assume further that on December 31, 1966, S owns a  capital asset with an adjusted basis of $100 and a fair market value of  $50. If the group files a consolidated return for 1967, and S sells the  asset for $30, $50 of the $70 loss is treated as a built-in deduction,  since it was economically accrued in a separate return limitation year.  If S sells the asset for $80 instead of $30, the $20 loss is treated as  a built-in deduction.

Thus, only $7,000 of T's $10,000 net operating loss is a  consolidated net operating loss carryover to 1966, since such carryover  is limited to consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to  the consolidated net operating loss deduction), $30,000, minus such  consolidated taxable income recomputed by excluding the items of income  and deduction of T, $23,000 (i.e., consolidated taxable income computed  without regard to the $1,000 restoration of T's deferred gain and T's  $6,000 of other income).

S  also filed a short period return for the period from February 1 to  December 31, 1967, and joined with P in filing a consolidated return for  1968. S sustained net operating losses of $5,000 and $6,000 for its  taxable years ending January 31, 1967, and December 31, 1967,  respectively.

Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no subsidiary shall have  authority to act for or to represent itself in any such matter. For  example, any election available to a subsidiary corporation in the  computation of its separate taxable income must be made by the common  parent, as must any change in an election previously made by the  subsidiary corporation; all correspondence will be carried on directly  with the common parent; the common parent shall file for all extensions  of time including extensions of time for payment of tax under section  6164; notices of deficiencies will be mailed only to the common parent,  and the mailing to the common parent shall be considered as a mailing to  each subsidiary in the group; notice and demand for payment of taxes  will be given only to the common parent and such notice and demand will  be considered as a notice and demand to each subsidiary; the common  parent will file petitions and conduct proceedings before the Tax Court  of the United States, and any such petition shall be considered as also  having been filed by each such subsidiary.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this  paragraph, any notice of deficiency, in respect of the tax for a  consolidated return year, will name each corporation which was a member  of the group during any part of such period (but a failure to include  the name of any such member will not affect the validity of the notice  of deficiency as to the other members); any notice and demand for  payment will name each corporation which was a member of the group  during any part of such period (but a failure to include the name of any  such member will not affect the validity of the notice and demand as to  the other members); and any levy, any notice of a lien, or any other  proceeding to collect the amount of any assessment, after the assessment  has been made, will name the corporation from which such collection is  to be made. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply whether or not  a consolidated return is made for any subsequent year, and whether or  not one or more subsidiaries have become or have ceased to be members of  the group at any time.

Notwithstanding section  338(a)(2), a target corporation for which an election is made under  section 338 is not deemed to terminate for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this section. Unless otherwise indicated, each example addresses the  question of which corporation is the proper party to execute a consent  to waive the statute of limitations for Years 1 and 2 or the more  general question of which corporation may be designated as a substitute  agent for the group for Years 1 and 2. In each example, as of January 1  of Year 1, the P group consists of P and its two subsidiaries, S and S- 1. P, as the common parent of the P group, files consolidated returns  for the P group in Years 1 and 2. On January 1 of Year 1, domestic  corporations S-2, U, V, W, W-1, X, Y, Z and Z-1 are not related to P or  the members of the P group. All corporations are calendar year  taxpayers. For none of the tax years at issue does the Commissioner  exercise the authority under paragraph (a)(6) of this section to deal  with any member separately. Any surviving corporation in a merger is a  successor as   described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. Any notification to  the Commissioner of the designation of the P group's substitute agent  also contains a statement signed on behalf of the designated agent that  it agrees to act as the group's substitute agent and, in the case of a  successor, that it is primarily liable as a successor of a member. The  examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Disposition of all group members. On December 31 of Year  1, P sells all the stock of S-1 to X. On December 31 of Year 2, P  distributes all the stock of S to P's shareholders. P files a separate  return for Year 3. Although P is no longer a common parent after Year 2,  P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2. For as long as P  remains in existence, only P may execute a waiver of the period of  limitations on assessment on behalf of the group for Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Acquisition of common parent by another group. The facts  are the same as in Example 1, except on January 1 of Year 3, all of the  outstanding stock of P is acquired by Y. P thereafter joins in the Y  group consolidated return as a member of Y group. Although P is a member  of Y group in Year 3, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1  and 2. For as long as P remains in existence, only P may execute a  waiver of the period of limitations on assessment on behalf of the P  group for Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Merger of common parent--designation of remaining member  as substitute agent. On December 31 of Year 1, P sells all the stock of  S-1 to X. On July 1 of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S-2. On  November 30 of Year 2, P distributes all the stock of S to P's  shareholders. On January 1 of Year 3, P merges into Y corporation. Just  before the merger, P notifies the Commissioner in writing of the planned  merger and of its designation of S as the substitute agent for the P  group for Years 1 and 2. S is the only member that P can designate as  the substitute agent for both Years 1 and 2 because it is the only  subsidiary that was a member of the P group during part of both years.  Although S-2 is the only remaining subsidiary of the P group when P  merges into Y, S-2 was a member of the P group only in Year 2. For that  reason, S-2 cannot be the substitute agent for the P group for Year 1.  Alternatively, P could designate a different substitute agent for each  year, selecting S or S-1 as the substitute agent for Year 1, and S or S- 2 as the substitute agent for Year 2. P could also designate its  successor Y as the substitute agent for both Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Forward triangular merger of common parent. On January 1  of Year 3, P merges with and into Z-1, a subsidiary of Z, in a forward  triangular merger described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). The  transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under Sec. 1.1502- 75(d)(3)(i) because P's shareholders receive more than 50% of Z's stock  in exchange for all of P's stock. Just before the merger, P notifies the  Commissioner in writing of the planned merger and its designation of Z- 1, the corporation that will survive the planned merger, as the  substitute agent of the P group for Years 1 and 2. Because Z-1 will be  P's successor (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section)  after the planned merger, P may designate Z-1 as the substitute agent  for the P group for Years 1 and 2, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this  section. Alternatively, P could have designated S or S-1 as the  substitute agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2. Although Z is the  new common parent of the P group, which continues pursuant to  Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), P may not designate Z as the substitute agent  for Years 1 and 2 because Z was not a member of the group during any  part of Years 1 or 2 and is not a successor of P or any other member of  P group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Reverse triangular merger of common parent. On March 1 of  Year 3, W-1, a subsidiary of W, merges into P, in a reverse triangular  merger described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). P survives the  merger with W-1. The transaction constitutes a reverse acquisition under  Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i) because P's shareholders receive more than 50%  of W's stock in exchange for all of P's stock. Under paragraph (a) of  this section, P remains the agent for the P group for Years 1 and 2,  even though the P group continues with W as its new common parent  pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i). Because the transaction constitutes  a reverse acquisition, the P group is treated as remaining in existence  with W as its common parent. Before March 2 of Year 3, P is the agent  for the P group for Year 3. Beginning on March 2 of Year 3, W becomes  the agent for the P group with respect to all of Year 3 (including the  period through March 1) and subsequent consolidated return years. For as  long as P remains in existence, P remains the agent of the P group under  paragraph (a) of this section for Years 1 and 2, and therefore only P  may execute a waiver of the period of limitations on assessment on  behalf of the P group for Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Reverse triangular merger of common parent-subsequent  spinoff of common parent. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except  that on April 1 of Year 4, in a transaction unrelated to the Year 3  reverse acquisition, P distributes the stock of its subsidiaries S and  S-1 to W, and W then distributes the stock of P to the W shareholders.  Beginning on March 2 of Year 3, W becomes the agent for the P group with  respect to Year 3 (including the period through March 1) and subsequent  consolidated return years. Although P is no longer a member of the P   group after the Year 4 spinoff, P remains the agent for the P group  under paragraph (a) of this section for Years 1 and 2. Thus, for as long  as P remains in existence, only P may execute a waiver of the period of  limitations on assessment on behalf of the P group for Years 1 and 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Qualified stock purchase and section 338 election. On  March 31 of Year 2, V purchases the stock of P in a qualified stock  purchase (within the meaning of section 338(d)(3)), and V makes a timely  election pursuant to section 338(g) with respect to P. Although section  338(a)(2) provides that P is treated as a new corporation as of the  beginning of the day after the acquisition date for purposes of subtitle  A, paragraph (e)(4) of this section provides that P's existence is not  deemed to terminate for purposes of this section notwithstanding the  general rule of section 338(a)(2). Therefore, the election under section  338(g) does not result in a termination of P under paragraph (e) of this  section, and new P remains the agent of the P group for Year 1 and the  period ending March 31 of Year 2 (short Year 2). For as long as new P  remains in existence, only new P may execute a waiver of the period of  limitations on assessment on behalf of the P group for Year 1 and short  Year 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Fraudulent conveyance of assets. On March 15 of Year 2, P  files a consolidated return that includes the income of S and S-1 for  Year 1. On December 1 of Year 2, S-1 transfers assets having a fair  market value of $100x to U in exchange for $10x. This transfer of assets  for less than fair market value constitutes a fraudulent conveyance  under applicable state law. On March 1 of Year 5, P executes a waiver  extending to December 31 of Year 6 the period of limitations on  assessment with respect to the group's Year 1 consolidated return. On  February 1 of Year 6, the Commissioner issues a notice of deficiency to  P asserting a deficiency of $30x for the P group's Year 1 consolidated  tax liability. P does not file a petition for redetermination in the Tax  Court, and the Commissioner makes a timely assessment against the P  group. P, S and S-1 are all insolvent and are unable to pay the  deficiency. On February 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner sends a notice of  transferee liability to U, which does not file a petition in the Tax  Court. On August 1 of Year 8, the Commissioner assesses the amount of  the P group's deficiency against U. Under section 6901(c), the  Commissioner may assess U's transferee liability within one year after  the expiration of the period of limitations against the transferor S-1.  By operation of section 6213(a) and 6503(a), the issuance of the notice  of deficiency to P and the expiration of the 90-day period for filing a  petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending by 150  days the P group's limitations period on assessment from the previously  extended date of December 31 of Year 6 to May 30 of Year 7. Pursuant to  paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, the waiver executed by P on March 1  of Year 5 to extend the period of limitations on assessment to December  31 of Year 6 and the further extension of the P group's limitations  period to May 30 of Year 7 (by operation of sections 6213(a) and  6503(a)) have the derivative effect of extending the period of  limitations on assessment of U's transferee liability to May 30 of Year  8. By operation of section 6901(f), the issuance of the notice of  transferee liability to U and the expiration of the 90-day period for  filing a petition in the Tax Court have the effect of further extending  the limitations period on assessment of U's liability as a transferee by  150 days, from May 30 of Year 8 to October 27 of Year 8. Accordingly,  the Commissioner may send a notice of transferee liability to U at any  time on or before May 30 of Year 8 and assess the unpaid liability  against U at any time on or before October 27 of Year 8. The result  would be the same even if S-1 ceased to exist before March 1 of Year 5,  the date P executed the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cross-reference.

If the common parent is an entity created or organized under  the law of a foreign country and is treated as a domestic corporation by  reason of section 7874 (or regulations under that section) or a section  953(d) election (a foreign common parent), the Commissioner may at any  time, with or without a request from any member of the group, designate  another member of the group to act as the agent for the group (a  domestic substitute agent) for any taxable year for which the  consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after  July 23, 2007, and the foreign common parent would otherwise be the  agent for the group. For each such year, the domestic substitute agent  will be the sole agent for the group even though the foreign common  parent remains in existence. The foreign common parent ceases to be the  agent for the group when the Commissioner's designation of a domestic  substitute agent becomes effective. The Commissioner may designate a  domestic substitute agent for the term of a single taxable year,  multiple years, or on a continuing basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Domestic substitute agent. The domestic substitute agent, by  designation or by succession, shall be a domestic corporation described  in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section (determined without regard to  section 7874, a section 953(d) election or section 1504(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Designation by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will notify  the domestic substitute agent in writing by mail or faxed transmission  of the designation. The domestic substitute agent's designation is  effective on the earliest of the 14th day following the date of a  mailing, the 4th day following a faxed transmission, or the date the  Commissioner receives written confirmation of the designation by a duly  authorized officer of the domestic substitute agent (within the meaning  of section 6062). The domestic substitute agent must give notice of its  designation to the foreign common parent and each corporation that was a  member of the group during any part of any consolidated return year for  which the domestic substitute agent will be the agent. A failure of the  domestic substitute agent to notify the foreign common parent or any  member of the group does not invalidate the designation. The  Commissioner will send a copy of the notification to the foreign common  parent, and if applicable, to any domestic substitute agent the  designation replaces; a failure to send a copy of the notification does  not invalidate the designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Term of agency--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable years for which domestic substitute  agent is the agent. If the Commissioner designates a domestic substitute  agent for one or more taxable years, unless the designation is expressly  limited to such term, such domestic substitute agent will continue as  the group's sole agent for subsequent taxable years until the domestic  substitute agent ceases to be a member of the continuing group, is  replaced by a new domestic common parent (as provided in paragraph  (j)(4)(iv)(A) of this section), is replaced by the Commissioner, or is  replaced by a default substitute agent (as provided in paragraph  (j)(5)(ii) of this section). If during the course of a consolidated  return year the domestic substitute agent ceases to be a member of the  continuing group or is replaced, it shall no longer act as agent for  such taxable year or subsequent taxable years in any matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section) or by the Commissioner, the domestic substitute agent at the  end of a taxable year of the group will remain the agent for such year  until its existence terminates, even if the group subsequently ceases to  exist or the domestic substitute agent subsequently ceases to be a  member of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Replacement of a Sec. 1.1502-77(d)(1) agent. If, pursuant to  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the common parent of the group  designates a foreign common parent as the agent for the group for any  taxable year, the Commissioner may, at any time, designate a domestic  substitute agent to replace the foreign common parent, even if the  Commissioner approved the terminating common parent's designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Group continues with a new common parent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Year the new  common parent becomes the common parent. If the group has a domestic  substitute agent and the group continues in existence with a new common  parent during a consolidated return year, and such new common parent is  a domestic corporation (determined without regard to section 7874 or a  section 953(d) election), the domestic substitute agent at the beginning  of the year is the agent for the group through the date of the  transaction in which the new common parent becomes the common parent,  and the new common parent becomes the agent for the group beginning the  day after the transaction, at which time it becomes the agent for the  group with respect to the entire consolidated return year (including the  period through the date of the transaction) and the former domestic  substitute agent will no longer be the agent for the group for that  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Years preceding the year the new common parent becomes the  common parent. If after the Commissioner's designation of a domestic  substitute agent the group remains in existence with a new common  parent, and such new common parent is a domestic corporation (determined  without regard to section 7874 or a section 953(d) election), the  Commissioner may designate the new common parent as the sole agent for  the group for any of the group's prior taxable years (for which the  consolidated Federal income tax return is due (without extensions) after  July 23, 2007) in which the new common parent was a member of the group.  For this purpose, the new common parent is treated as having been a  member of the group for any taxable year it is primarily liable for the  group's income tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Replacement of domestic substitute agent by the Commissioner.  The Commissioner may at any time, with or without a request from any  member of the group, designate a replacement for a domestic substitute  agent (or a successor to such agent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deemed Sec. 1.1502-77(d) designation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Thus, for example, if a member  filed a separate return for the third year preceding a consolidated  return year in which a consolidated net operating loss was sustained and  if any portion of such loss is apportioned to such member for such  separate return year, such portion may not be carried back by the group  to its third year preceding such consolidated return year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated  return year, any consolidated net operating loss carryover from a prior  taxable year must first be carried to such consolidated return year,  notwithstanding that all or a portion of the consolidated net operating  loss giving rise to the carryover is attributable to the corporation  which ceases to be a member.

For purposes of this subparagraph, the separate net operating  loss of a member of the group shall be determined under Sec. 1.1502-12  (except that no deduction shall be allowed under section 242), adjusted  for the following items taken into account in the computation of the  consolidated net operating loss:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The portion of the consolidated dividends received deduction,  the consolidated charitable contributions deductions, and the  consolidated section 247 deduction, attributable to such member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such member's capital gain net income (net capital gain for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (determined without  regard to any net capital loss carryover attributable to such member);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Such member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss,  reduced by the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable  to such member (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover  attributable to such member which is absorbed in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples.

This section and Secs. 1.1502-92A and 1.1502-93A set forth the rules for  determining an ownership change under section 382 for members of  consolidated groups and the section 382 limitations with respect to  attributes described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. These  rules generally provide that an ownership change and the section 382  limitation are determined with respect to these attributes for the group  (or loss subgroup) on a single entity basis and not for its members  separately. Following an ownership change of a loss group (or a loss  subgroup) under Sec. 1.1502-92A, the amount of consolidated taxable  income for any post-change year which may be offset by pre-change  consolidated attributes (or pre-change subgroup attributes) shall not  exceed the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382  limitation) for such year as determined under Sec. 1.1502-93A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for post-change year that includes the change date.

See generally Sec. 1.382-6 (relating to the allocation  of income and loss). The allocation of consolidated taxable income for  the post-change year that includes the change date must be made before  taking into account any consolidated net operating loss deduction (as  defined in Sec. 1.1502-21(a) or 1.1502-21T(a) in effect prior to June  25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as  applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cross reference.

The  determination whether a consolidated group (or loss subgroup) has a net  unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is based on the  aggregate amount of the separately computed net unrealized built-in  gains or losses of each member that is included in the group (or loss  subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, including items of  built-in income and deduction described in section 382(h)(6). Thus, for  example, amounts deferred under section 267, or under Sec. 1.1502-13  (other than amounts deferred with respect to the stock of a   member (or an intercompany obligation) included in the group (or loss  subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of this section) are built-in items.  The threshold requirement under section 382(h)(3)(B) applies on an  aggregate basis and not on a member-by-member basis. The separately  computed amount of a member included in a group or loss subgroup does  not include any unrealized built-in gain or loss on stock (including  stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and Sec. 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and  (iii)) of another member included in the group or loss subgroup (or on  an intercompany obligation). However, a member of a group or loss  subgroup includes in its separately computed amount the unrealized  built-in gain or loss on stock of another member (or on an intercompany  obligation) not included in the group or loss subgroup. If a member is  not included in a group (or loss subgroup) under paragraph (g)(2) of  this section, the determination of whether the member has a net  unrealized built-in gain or loss under section 382(h)(3) is made on a  separate entity basis. See Sec. 1.1502-94A(c) (relating to built-in gain  or loss of a new loss member) and Sec. 1.1502-96A(a) (relating to the  end of separate tracking of certain losses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Members included--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consolidated group.

The total value of the L1 stock is  $600 and the value of the L1 stock held by B is $120. The L group is a  loss group under Sec. 1.1502-91A(c)(1) because it is entitled to use its  net operating loss carryover from Year 1. On August 15, Year 2, A sells  51 percent of the L stock to C.

Immediately  after the close of November 11, Year 3, B's percentage ownership  interest in the common parent of the loss group (HC) has increased by 55  percentage points over its lowest percentage ownership during the  testing period (zero percent).

A, B, and C, as a result of owning stock of  L, own 90 percent of P's stock after the merger. D owns the remaining 10  percent of P's stock. The merger of L into P qualifies as a reverse  acquisition of the L group under Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(3)(i), and the L loss  group is treated as remaining in existence, with P taking the place of L  as the new common parent of the L group.

The  appropriate adjustments include adjustments so that HC succeeds to the  owner shifts of other members of the former group. Thus, HC succeeds to  the owner shift of L that resulted from the sale of the 20 percent  interest to B in determining whether the HC loss subgroup has an  ownership change on February 5, Year 3, and   on any subsequent testing date that includes January 19, Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> End of separate tracking of certain losses.

The common parent may apportion all or  part of each element of the consolidated section 382 limitation  determined under Sec. 1.1502-93A. For this purpose, the consolidated  section 382 limitation consists of two elements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The value element, which is the element of the limitation  determined under section 382(b)(1) (relating to value multiplied by the  long-term tax-exempt rate) without regard to such adjustments as those  described in section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused  section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section  382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date),  section 382(h) (relating to built-in gains and section 338 gains), and  section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The adjustment element, which is so much (if any) of the  limitation for the taxable year during which the former member ceases to  be a member of the consolidated group that is attributable to a  carryover of unused limitation under section 382(b)(2) or to recognized  built-in gains under 382(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of apportionment on the consolidated section 382  limitation. The value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation  for any post-change year ending after the day that a former member (or  loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is reduced to the extent that it  is apportioned under this paragraph (c). The consolidated section 382  limitation for the post-change year in which the former member (or loss  subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is also reduced to the extent that  the adjustment element for that year is apportioned under this paragraph  (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect on corporations to which the consolidated section 382  limitation is apportioned. The amount of the value element that is  apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as the  amount determined under section 382(b)(1) for purposes of determining  the amount of that corporation's (or loss subgroup's) section 382  limitation for any taxable year ending after the former member (or loss  subgroup) ceases to be a member(s). Appropriate adjustments must be made  to the limitation based on the value element so apportioned for a short  taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment  required under section 382. The adjustment element apportioned to a  former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as an adjustment under  section 382(b)(2) or section   382(h), as appropriate, for the first taxable year after the member (or  members) ceases to be a member (or members).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deemed apportionment when loss group terminates. If a loss group  terminates, to the extent the consolidated section 382 limitation is not  apportioned under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the consolidated  section 382 limitation is deemed to be apportioned to the loss subgroup  that includes the common parent, or, if there is no loss subgroup that  includes the common parent immediately after the loss group terminates,  to the common parent. A loss group terminates on the first day of the  first taxable year that is a separate return year with respect to each  member of the former loss group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Appropriate adjustments when former member leaves during the  year. Appropriate adjustments are made to the consolidated section 382  limitation for the consolidated return year during which the former  member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) to reflect the  inclusion of the former member in the loss group for a portion of that  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> L owns all the L1 stock  and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L group has a $200 consolidated net  operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. At the  close of December 31, Year 1, the group has an ownership change under  Sec. 1.1502-92A. The ownership change results in a consolidated section  382 limitation of $10 based on the value of the stock of the group. On  August 29, Year 2, L1 sells 30 percent of the stock of L2 to A. L2 is  apportioned $90 of the group's $200 consolidated net operating loss  under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25,  1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as  applicable.

For its  consolidated return years ending after August 29, Year 2, (other than  the year ending December 31, Year 2) the L group's consolidated section  382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change  consolidated attribute is $4 ($10 minus the $6 value element apportioned  to L2), adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused  section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(6)</em> of this section. Therefore, the value element of the consolidated  section 382 limitation for Year 2 of the L group is $8 (rounded to the  nearest dollar).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The section 382 limitation for L2's short taxable year ending  December 31, Year 2, is $2 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is the  amount that bears the same relationship to $6, the value element of the  consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, as the number of  days during that short taxable year, 124 days, bears to 365.

The facts are the same  as in Example 1, except that L does not elect to apportion any portion  of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. For its separate  return years ending after August 29, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation  with respect to the $90 of the group's pre-change consolidated attribute  apportioned to L2 is zero under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.  Thus, the $90 consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 cannot  offset L2's taxable income in any of its separate return years ending  after August 29, Year 2. For its consolidated return years ending after  August 29, Year 2, the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation  with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute  is $10, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused  section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.

The P group has a consolidated net  operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On  December 11, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to corporation M.

Formation of a new loss subgroup. The facts are the same  as in Example 1, except that A purchases 40 percent of the L1 stock from  L rather than purchasing L2 stock from L1. L1 and L2 file a consolidated  return for their first taxable year ending after May 22, Year 3, and  each of L1 and L2 carries over a part of the net operating loss of the P  group that arose in Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L1  and L2 cease to be members of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3. The  net operating losses carried over from the P group are treated as pre- change subgroup attributes of the loss subgroup composed of L1 and L2.  The subgroup section 382 limitation with respect to those losses is zero  unless M elects to apportion all or part of the subgroup section 382  limitation of the L loss subgroup to the L1 loss subgroup.

M's acquisition results in  an ownership change of the P loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502- 92A(b)(1)(ii).

Sections 1.1502-94A through 1.1502-96A also apply on any date  on or after January 1, 1997, and before June 25, 1999, on which a  corporation becomes a member of a group or on which a corporation ceases  to be a member of a loss group (or a loss subgroup).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (relating to recognized built-in gain of a loss group or  loss subgroup) applies to taxable years for which the due date for  income tax returns (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Methods permitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For the  period ending before January 1, 1997, a consolidated group is permitted  to use any method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section which is  consistently applied to determine if an ownership change occurred with  respect to a consolidated net operating loss, a net operating loss  carryover (including net operating loss carryovers arising in SRLYs), or  a net unrealized built-in loss. If an ownership change occurred during  that period, the group is also permitted to use any method described in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section which is consistently applied to  compute the amount of the section 382 limitation that applies to limit  the use of taxable income in any post-change year ending before, on, or  after January 1, 1997. The preceding sentence does not preclude the  imposition of an additional, lesser limitation due to a subsequent  ownership change nor, except as   provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, does it permit the  beginning of a new testing period for the loss group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments to offset excess limitation. If an ownership change  occurred during the period ending before January 1, 1997, and a method  described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section was not used for a post- change year, the members (or group) must reduce the section 382  limitation for post-change years for which an income tax return is filed  after January 1, 1997, to offset, as quickly as possible, the effects of  any section 382 limitation that members took into account in excess of  the amount that would have been allowable under Secs. 1.1502-91A through  1.1502-96A and 1.1502-98A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section does not cause a new testing period of the loss  group to begin for purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502-92A on or after  January 1, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> on any day before January 1, 1992, on which  the determination of net unrealized built-in gain or loss of a loss  subgroup is made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonable application of the rules in section 382 and the  regulations thereunder applied to each member on a separate entity  basis, treating each member's allocable part of a consolidated net  operating loss which is attributable to it under Sec. 1.1502-21(b) or  1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR  part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable as a net operating loss of  that member and applying rules similar to Sec. 1.382-8 to avoid  duplication of value in computing the section 382 limitation for the  member (see Sec. 1.382-8(h) (relating to the effective date and  transition rules regarding controlled groups)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A method approved by the Commissioner upon application by the  common parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amended returns.
