                            <p class="depth0">An application for insurance of a mortgage under this part shall be  considered only in connection with a hospital that is in substantial  compliance with regulations of the Department of Health and Human  Services and the regulations of the applicable state governing the  operation and reimbursement of hospitals. A hospital that is under  investigation by any state or federal agency for statutory or regulatory  violations is not eligible so long as the investigation is unresolved,  unless HUD determines that the investigation is minor in nature; that  is, the investigation is unlikely to result in substantial liabilities  or to otherwise substantially harm the creditworthiness of the hospital.</p>
