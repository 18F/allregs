If the sum of the direct freight and the direct passenger  expenses does not aggregate to more than 50 percent of the total charges  for an accounting division, the common expenses should be separated on  the basis of special test. Where common expenses exist in an accounting  division but the direct expenses are applicable to only one service,  i.e., freight or passenger, the common expenses shall be separated on  the basis of a special test. If the accounting is performed on a system  basis rather than   by accounting divisions, the common expenses shall be separated on the  basis of a special study.</p>
