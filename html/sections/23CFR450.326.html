In nonattainment or maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, if a TIP amendment involves non-exempt projects (per 40 CFR part 93), or is replaced with an updated TIP, the MPO and the FHWA and the FTA must make a new conformity determination. In all areas, changes that affect fiscal constraint must take place by amendment of the TIP. Public participation procedures consistent with Sec. 450.316(a) shall be utilized in revising the TIP, except that these procedures are not required for administrative modifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After approval by the MPO and the Governor, the TIP shall be included without change, directly or by reference, in the STIP required under 23 U.S.C. 135. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, a conformity finding on the TIP must be made by the FHWA and the FTA before it is included in the STIP. A copy of the approved TIP shall be provided to the FHWA and the FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State shall notify the MPO and Federal land management agencies when a TIP including projects under the jurisdiction of these agencies has been included in the STIP.</p>
