The lights shall be displayed not less than 20 feet above mean high water, but not at a height greater than that specified in Sec.  67.05-1(f), except that on Class ``B'' structures which are required to be marked by only one light, that light may be displayed not less than 10 feet above mean high water if the structural features preclude mounting the light within the range of heights otherwise specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The District Commander may waive the requirement for obstruction lights on Class ``B'' structures if there is no hazard to navigation by so doing.
