                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any compliance application shall describe the chemical,  radiological and physical composition of all existing waste proposed for  disposal in the disposal system. To the extent practicable, any  compliance application shall also describe the chemical, radiological  and physical composition of to-be-generated waste proposed for disposal  in the disposal system. These descriptions shall include a list of waste  components and their approximate quantities in the waste. This list may  be derived from process knowledge, current non-destructive examination/ assay, or other information and methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Department shall submit in the compliance certification  application the results of an analysis which substantiates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That all waste characteristics influencing containment of waste  in the disposal system have been identified and assessed for their  impact on disposal system performance. The characteristics to be  analyzed shall include, but shall not be limited to: Solubility;  formation of colloidal suspensions containing radionuclides; production  of gas from the waste; shear strength; compactability; and other waste- related inputs into the computer models that are used in the performance  assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That all waste components influencing the waste characteristics  identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been identified and  assessed for their impact on disposal system performance. The components  to be analyzed shall include, but shall not be limited to: metals;  cellulosics; chelating agents; water and other liquids; and activity in  curies of each isotope of the radionuclides present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any decision to exclude consideration of any waste  characteristic or waste component because such characteristic or  component is not expected to significantly influence the containment of  the waste in the disposal system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each waste component identified and assessed pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section, the Department shall specify the limiting  value (expressed as an upper or lower limit of mass, volume, curies,  concentration, etc.), and the associated uncertainty (i.e., margin of  error) for each limiting value, of the total inventory of such waste  proposed for disposal in the disposal system. Any compliance application  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demonstrate that, for the total inventory of waste proposed for  disposal in the disposal system, WIPP complies with the numeric  requirements of Sec. 194.34 and Sec. 194.55 for the upper or lower  limits (including the associated uncertainties), as appropriate, for  each waste component identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and  for the plausible combinations of upper and lower limits of such waste  components that would result in the greatest estimated release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide information that demonstrates that the use of acceptable  knowledge to quantify components in waste for disposal conforms with the   quality assurance requirements of Sec. 194.22.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide information which demonstrates that a system of controls  has been and will continue to be implemented to confirm that the total  amount of each waste component that will be emplaced in the disposal  system will not exceed the upper limiting value or fall below the lower  limiting value described in the introductory text of paragraph (c) of  this section. The system of controls shall include, but shall not be  limited to: Measurement; sampling; chain of custody records; record  keeping systems; waste loading schemes used; and other documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify and describe such controls delineated in paragraph  (c)(4) of this section and confirm that they are applied in accordance  with the quality assurance requirements found in Sec. 194.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department shall include a waste loading scheme in any  compliance application, or else performance assessments conducted  pursuant to Sec. 194.32 and compliance assessments conducted pursuant  to Sec. 194.54 shall assume random placement of waste in the disposal  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waste may be emplaced in the disposal system only if the  emplaced components of such waste will not cause:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total quantity of waste in the disposal system to exceed the  upper limiting value, including the associated uncertainty, described in  the introductory text to paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total quantity of waste that will have been emplaced in the  disposal system, prior to closure, to fall below the lower limiting  value, including the associated uncertainty, described in the  introductory text to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waste emplacement shall conform to the assumed waste loading  conditions, if any, used in performance assessments conducted pursuant  to Sec. 194.32 and compliance assessments conducted pursuant to Sec.  194.54.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Department shall demonstrate in any compliance application  that the total inventory of waste emplaced in the disposal system  complies with the limitations on transuranic waste disposal described in  the WIPP LWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Administrator will use inspections and records reviews, such  as audits, to verify compliance with this section.
