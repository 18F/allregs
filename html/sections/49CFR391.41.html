                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person subject to this part must not operate a  commercial motor vehicle unless he or she is medically certified as  physically qualified to do so, and, except as provided in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, when on-duty has on his or her person the  original, or a copy, of a current medical examiner's certificate that he  or she is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle.  NOTE: Effective December 29, 1991, the FMCSA Administrator determined  that the new Licencia Federal de Conductor issued by the United Mexican  States is recognized as proof of medical fitness to drive a CMV. The  United States and Canada entered into a Reciprocity Agreement, effective  March 30, 1999, recognizing that a Canadian commercial driver's license  is proof of medical fitness to drive a CMV. Therefore, Canadian and  Mexican CMV drivers are not required to have in their possession a  medical examiner's certificate if the driver has been issued, and  possesses, a valid commercial driver license issued by the United  Mexican States, or a Canadian Province or Territory and whose license  and medical status, including any waiver or exemption, can be  electronically verified. Drivers from any of the countries who have  received a medical authorization that deviates from the mutually  accepted compatible medical standards of the resident country are not  qualified to drive a CMV in the other countries. For example, Canadian  drivers who do not meet the medical fitness provisions of the Canadian  National Safety Code for Motor Carriers, but are issued a waiver by one  of the Canadian Provinces or Territories, are not qualified to drive a  CMV   in the United States. In addition, U.S. drivers who received a medical  variance from FMCSA are not qualified to drive a CMV in Canada.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person who qualifies for the medical examiner's certificate  by virtue of having obtained a medical variance from FMCSA, in the form  of an exemption letter or a skill performance evaluation certificate,  must have on his or her person a copy of the variance documentation when  on-duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CDL/CLP exception. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Beginning on January 30, 2015 and  ending on the day before June 22, 2018, a driver required to have a  commercial driver's license under part 383 of this chapter, and who  submitted a current medical examiner's certificate to the State in  accordance with 49 CFR 383.71(h) documenting that he or she meets the  physical qualification requirements of this part, no longer needs to  carry on his or her person the medical examiner's certificate specified  at Sec. 391.43(h), or a copy, for more than 15 days after the date it  was issued as valid proof of medical certification.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Beginning on June 22, 2018, a driver required to have a  commercial driver's license or a commercial learner's permit under 49  CFR part 383, and who has a current medical examiner's certificate  documenting that he or she meets the physical qualification requirements  of this part, is no longer needs to carry on his or her person the  medical examiner's certificate specified at Sec. 391.43(h).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning July 8, 2015, a driver required to have a commercial  learner's permit under part 383 of this chapter, and who submitted a  current medical examiner's certificate to the State in accordance with  Sec. 383.71(h) of this chapter documenting that he or she meets the  physical qualification requirements of this part, no longer needs to  carry on his or her person the medical examiner's certificate specified  at Sec. 391.43(h), or a copy for more than 15 days after the date it  was issued as valid proof of medical certification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A CDL or CLP holder required by Sec. 383.71(h) of this  chapter to obtain a medical examiner's certificate, who obtained such by  virtue of having obtained a medical variance from FMCSA, must continue  to have in his or her possession the original or copy of that medical  variance documentation at all times when on-duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor  vehicle if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That person meets the physical qualification standards in  paragraph (b) of this section and has complied with the medical  examination requirements in Sec. 391.43;
