                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of exemption. An exemption is provided for  trademarked articles accompanying any person arriving in the United  States which would be prohibited entry under section 526, Tariff Act of  1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1526), or section 42 of the Act of July 5,  1946 (60 Stat. 440; 15 U.S.C. 1124), because the trademark has been  registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and recorded with  Customs. The exemption may be applied to those trademarked articles of  foreign manufacture bearing a trademark owned by a citizen of, or a  corporation or association created or organized within, the United  States when imported for the arriving person's personal use in the  quantities provided in pararaph (c) of this section. Unregistered and  unrecorded trademarked articles are not subject to quantity limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 30-day period. The exemption in paragraph (a)  of this section shall not be granted to any person who has taken  advantage of the exemption for the same type of article within the 30- day period immediately prior to his arrival in the United States. The  date of the person's last arrival on which he claimed this exemption  shall be considered to be the date he last took advantage of the  exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sale of exempted articles. If an article which has been exempted  is sold within one year of the date of importation, the article or its  value (to be recovered from the importer), is subject to forfeiture. A  sale subject to judicial order or in the liquidation of an estate is not  subject to the provisions of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Quantities. Generally, each person arriving in the United States  may apply the exemption to one article of the type bearing a protected  trademark. The Commissioner shall determine if a quantity of an article  in excess of one may be entered and, with the approval of the Secretary  of the Treasury, publish in the Federal Register a list of types of  articles and the quantities of each entitled to the exemption. If the  holder of a protected trademark allows importation of a quantity in  excess of one of its particular trademarked article, the total of those  trademarked articles authorized by the trademark holder may be entered  without penalty.  [T.D. 79-159, 44 FR 31969, June 4, 1979; 44 FR 35208, June 19, 1979, as  amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46115, Sept. 10, 1991]</p>
