For  very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate  continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on  24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the  maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design  based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based  on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts  refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per  kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts  municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per  kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design  not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit.  Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount  of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the  maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the  maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed  to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For  example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the unit can combust 24/16, or  1.5 batches, in 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carbon monoxide pollutant rate. When hourly average pollutant  rates (Eh) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the  rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (Ea) for each  12-hour period using the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16DE05.001  Where:  Ea = Average carbon monoxide pollutant rate for the 12-hour</p><p class="depth2">period, ppm corrected to 7 percent O2.
