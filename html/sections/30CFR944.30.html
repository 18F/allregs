                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Governor of the State of Utah (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies</p><p class="depth0">A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary of the Interior under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480 through 3487, and surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and the Utah Code Annotated (State Act) governing such activities and the Utah State Program (Program).</p><p class="depth0">B. Purposes: The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Utah in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (DOGM) will be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">Article II: Effective Date</p><p class="depth0">After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register as a final rule. This agreement will remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.</p><p class="depth0">Article III: Definitions</p><p class="depth0">The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in SMCRA 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the State Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV: Applicability</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in Utah except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Article V: General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">A. Authority of State Agency: DOGM has and will continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement</p><p class="depth0">B. Funds: 1. Upon application by DOGM and subject to appropriations, OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of the Federal Act, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOGM in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement; and provided that such State-incurred cost per permitted acre of Federal lands does not exceed the per permitted area costs for similar administration and enforcement activities of the Program on non-Federal and non-Indian lands during the same time period.</p><p class="depth0">2. The ratio or cost split of Federal to non-Federal dollars allocated under the cooperative agreement will be determined by OSMRE and DOGM based on the projected costs for regulation of mines within Federal lands, in consideration of the relative amounts of Federal and non-Federal land involved. The designation of mines, based on Federal and non-federal land, will be prepared by DOGM and submitted to OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office. OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office and OSMRE's Western Field Operations office will work with DOGM to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in Utah in the absence of this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">3. OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal lands cost estimate, the DOGM-prepared list of acres by mine, and the State's overall cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOGM will submit its grant application to OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office. The Federal lands/non-Federal lands ratio will be applied to the final eligible total State expenditures to arrive at the total Federal reimbursement due the State. Assuming timely submission, this ratio or cost split will be agreed upon by July of the year preceding the applicable fiscal year in order to enable the State to budget funds for the Program.</p><p class="depth0">The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations in estimating the regulatory costs for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify DOGM as soon as possible if such projections are unrealistic.</p><p class="depth0">4. If DOGM applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and DOGM will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal lands in Utah are regulated in accordance with the Program.</p><p class="depth0">5. Funds provided to the DOGM under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reports and Records: DOGM will make annual reports to OSMRE containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). DOGM and OSMRE will exchange, upon request, except where prohibited by Federal or State law, information developed under this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">OSMRE will provide DOGM with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. DOGM comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress or other interested parties.</p><p class="depth0">D. Personnel: DOGM will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA the Federal lands program, and the Program.</p><p class="depth0">E. Equipment and Laboratories: DOGM will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for operations on Federal lands in Utah will be determined in accordance with 40-10-6(5), Utah Code Annotated 1953 as amended and UMC/SMC 771.25 of the State regulations, and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalty fines collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be deposited with the State Treasurer. Permit fees will be considered program income. Civil penalty fines will not be considered program income and will be deposited in an account for use in reclaiming abandoned mine sites. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will include a report of the amount of fees collected during the State's prior fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package</p><p class="depth0">A. Submission of Permit Application Package: DOGM and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities on Federal lands to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to DOGM. DOGM will furnish OSMRE and other Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by DOGM and will include any supplemental information required by OSMRE and the Federal land management agency. Where section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA applies, DOGM will work with the agency with jurisdiction over the

publicly owned park, including units of the National Park System, or historic property included in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to determine what supplemental information will be required.</p><p class="depth0">At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR part 740 and include the information necessary for DOGM to make a determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are responsible.</p><p class="depth0">B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved: 1. DOGM will assume the responsibilities for review of permit applications where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to consultation with the Federal land management agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4 (c)(2), DOGM will be responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions or amendments, the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOGM will request such Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOGM within 45 calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in obtaining this information, upon request.</p><p class="depth0">Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to DOGM under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE and the State, with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. DOGM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah on Federal lands not requiring a mining plan pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). DOGM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State Act and regulations. DOGM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding decisions on the PAP and will be responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Secretary will make his non-delegable determinations under SMCRA, some of which have been delegated to OSMRE.</p><p class="depth0">4. OSMRE and DOGM will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to DOGM when requested, if available resources allow. DOGM will keep OSMRE informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE may provide assistance to DOGM in resolving conflicts with Federal land management agencies. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DOGM. OSMRE will have access to DOGM files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSMRE will send to DOGM copies of all resulting correspondence between OSMRE and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">5. DOGM will make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any permit issued by DOGM will incorporate any terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park System (NPS), DOGM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to mitigate environmental impact as set forth under Article X of this agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The permit will include terms and conditions required by other applicable Federal laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> After making its decision on the PAP, DOGM will send a notice to the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction over a publicly owned park or historic property included in the NRHP which would be affected by a design under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. A copy of the permit and written findings will be submitted to OSMRE if requested.</p><p class="depth0">C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved: 1. DOGM will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), DOGM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah where a mining plan is required. OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and review.</p><p class="depth0">The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities that cannot be delegated to DOGM under the Federal lands program, MLA, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will

carry out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.</p><p class="depth0">Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE, and DOGM, with concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. DOGM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3847, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be the primary contact with the applicant. DOGM will send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the PAP. OSMRE will send to DOGM copies of all OSMRE correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, OSMRE will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program.</p><p class="depth0">BLM will inform DOGM of its actions and provide DOGM with a copy of documentation on all decisions. DOGM will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations. Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the Secretary approve the mining plan, OSMRE will consult with and obtain the concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land management agency and other Federal agencies as required.</p><p class="depth0">The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.</p><p class="depth0">DOGM will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c) (2) and (3), respectively. DOGM will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOGM will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOGM within 45 days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in obtaining this information, upon request of DOGM.</p><p class="depth0">3.

OSMRE will have access to DOGM files concerning operations on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth0">D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions, Amendments, or Renewals: 1. Any permit revision, amendment, or renewal for an operation on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by DOGM after consultation with OSMRE on whether such revision, amendment, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. OSMRE will inform DOGM within 30 days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision, amendment, or renewal, whether the permit revision, amendment, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and DOGM will follow the procedures outlined in paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of this Article.</p><p class="depth0">2. OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which permit revisions, amendments, and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications.</p><p class="depth0">3. Permit revisions, amendments, or renewals on Federal lands which are determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications under paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not being mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of this Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures outlined in paragraphs B.1. through B.5. of this Article.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII: Inspections</p><p class="depth0">A. DOGM will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.</p><p class="depth0">B. DOGM will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.</p><p class="depth0">C. DOGM will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">D. OSMRE will ordinarily give DOGM reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSMRE is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact DOGM no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger of significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to DOGM for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII: Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">A. DOGM will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and DOGM, DOGM will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. DOGM will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.</p><p class="depth0">C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint inspection where DOGM and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.</p><p class="depth0">D. DOGM and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.</p><p class="depth0">E. Personnel of DOGM and OSMRE will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.</p><p class="depth0">F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX: Bonds</p><p class="depth0">A. DOGM and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond payable to Utah and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Department. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. DOGM will advise OSMRE or annual adjustments to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program.</p><p class="depth0">B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such bond, DOGM will obtain the concurrence of OSMRE. OSMRE concurrence will include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.</p><p class="depth0">C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.</p><p class="depth0">D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.
Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid</p><p class="depth0">Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations</p><p class="depth0">A. Unsuitability Petitions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">2. When either DOGM or OSMRE receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of receipt and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and request and fully consider data, information and recommendations of the other. OSMRE will coordinate with the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction over the petition area, and will solicit comments from the agency.</p><p class="depth0">B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations</p><p class="depth0">The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, or for determinations of compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA are received prior to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities:</p><p class="depth0">1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, OSMRE will determine whether VER exists for such areas.</p><p class="depth0">For non-Federal lands within section 522(e)(1) areas DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will not affect Federal lands. For such non-Federal lands affecting Federal lands, OSMRE will make the VER determination.</p><p class="depth0">Under section 522(e)(1), for non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will not affect the Federal interest. For such non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System which affect the Federal interest, OSMRE will make the VER determination.</p><p class="depth0">2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determination.</p><p class="depth0">OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA.</p><p class="depth0">3.
