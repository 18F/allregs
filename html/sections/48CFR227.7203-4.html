                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in computer  software or computer software documentation, including a copyright  license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the  contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor  of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not  the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the  software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a  computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds  used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some  exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,  release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed  exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and  (c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203- 5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed  exclusively with Government funds or in   computer software documentation required to be delivered under a  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Source of funds determination. The determination of the source  of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest  practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a  software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may  assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software  which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at  252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and  Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.</p>
