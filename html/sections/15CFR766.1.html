                            <p class="depth0">In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter  VII, subchapter C. This part describes the procedures for imposing  administrative sanctions for violations of the Export Administration Act  of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export Administration Regulations  (EAR), or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. Parts  760 and 764 of the EAR specify those actions that constitute violations,  and part 764 describes the sanctions that apply. In addition to  describing the procedures for imposing sanctions, this part describes  the procedures for imposing temporary denial orders to prevent imminent  violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization  issued thereunder. This part also describes the procedures for taking  the discretionary protective administrative action of denying the export  privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating any of the  statutes, including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing  in this part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other  administrative or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR,  including the exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the  EAA. This part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any  requirements based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings  charging violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in  this part.</p>
