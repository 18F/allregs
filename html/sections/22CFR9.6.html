                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Derivative classification is: the incorporating,  paraphrasing, restating, or generating in new form information that is  already classified and the marking of the new material consistent with  the classification of the source material, or the marking of the  information in accordance with an authorized classification guide.  Duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not  derivative classification. Persons who apply classification markings  derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide  need not possess original classification authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility. Information classified derivatively from other  classified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with  instructions from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an  authorized classification guide and shall comply with the standards set  forth in sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executive Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The  duration of classification of a document classified by a derivative  classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years except  for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information that would reveal the identity of a confidential  human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key design  concepts of weapons of mass destruction (50X2-WMD), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific information incorporated into the classification guide  under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to exemptions from  automatic declassification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Department of State Classification Guide. The Department of  State Classification Guide (DSCG) is the primary authority for the  classification of information in documents created by Department of  State personnel. The Guide is classified ``Confidential'' and is found  on the Department of State's classified Web site.</p>
