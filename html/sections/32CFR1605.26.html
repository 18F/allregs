                            <p class="depth0">Each district appeal board, or panel thereof, shall elect a chairman and a vice-chairman at least every two years. A majority of the members of the board when present at any meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall decide any question. Every member, unless disqualified, shall vote on every question or classification. In case of a tie vote on a question or classification, the board shall postpone action until the next meeting. If the question or classification remains unresolved at the next meeting, the file will be transferred for classification in accord with Sec. 1605.25(c). If any member is absent so long as to hamper the work of the board, the chairman, a member of the board or panel concerned, or an area office employee shall report that fact to the Director of Selective Service and such action as appropriate shall be taken. If, through death, resignation, or other causes, the membership of the board falls below the prescribed number of members, the board or panel shall continue to function, provided a quorum of the prescribed membership is present at each official meeting.</p>
