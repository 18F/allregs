                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)-2(c))</em> are considered taken into account in determining  the amount of self-employment income that is subject to tax under  section 1401(b) and therefore not included in net investment income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rule for traders. In the case of gross income described  in Secs. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) derived from a trade or  business of trading in financial instruments or commodities (as  described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)), the deductions described in  Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii) properly allocable to the taxpayer's trade or  business of trading in financial instruments or commodities are taken  into account in determining the taxpayer's self-employment income only  to the extent that such deductions reduce the taxpayer's net earnings  from self-employment (after aggregating under Sec. 1.1402(a)-2(c) the  net earnings from self-employment from any trade or business carried on  by the taxpayer as an individual or as a member of a partnership). Any  deductions described in Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii) that exceed the amount  of net earnings from self-employment, in the aggregate (if applicable),  are allowed in determining the taxpayer's net investment income under  section 1411 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section. For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a  United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all  subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Exclusion from self-employment income. A is a general  partner in PRS, a partnership carrying on a trade or business that is  not a trade or business of trading in financial instruments or  commodities (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)). During Year 1,  A's distributive share from PRS is $1 million, $300,000 of which is  attributable to the gain on the sale of PRS's capital assets. Section  1402(a)(3)(A) provides an exclusion from net earnings from self- employment for any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital  asset. For Year 1, A has $700,000 self-employment income subject to  self-employment tax. This $700,000 subject to self-employment tax is not  included as part of net investment income under paragraph (a) of this  section. However, the $300,000 attributable to the gain on PRS's sale of  a capital asset is excluded from net earnings from self-employment, and  from self-employment income, and thus is not covered by the exception in  section 1411(c)(6). Therefore, the   $300,000 attributable to the gain on PRS's sale of a capital asset is  included as net investment income if the other requirements of section  1411 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Two trades or businesses. B is an individual engaged in  two trades or businesses, Business X and Business Y, neither of which is  the trade or business of trading in financial instruments or commodities  (as described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)). B carries on Business X as a sole  proprietor and B is also a general partner in a partnership that carries  on Business Y. Business Y is a nonpassive activity of B. During Year 1,  B had net earnings from self-employment consisting of the aggregate of a  $50,000 loss (that is, after application of the exclusions under section  1402(a)(1)-(17)) from Business X, and $70,000 in income (after  application of the exclusions under section 1402(a)(1)-(17)) from B's  distributive share from the partnership from carrying on Business Y.  Thus, B's net earnings from self-employment in Year 1 are $20,000. For  Year 1, all of B's income, deductions, gains, and losses from Business X  and distributive share from the partnership carrying on Business Y,  other than those amounts excluded due to application of section  1402(a)(1)-(17), are taken into account in determining B's net earnings  from self-employment and self-employment income for such taxable year.  Accordingly, in calculating B's net investment income (as defined in  Sec. 1.1411-4) for Year 1, B will not take into account the items of  income, loss, gain, and deduction that comprise B's $50,000 loss  attributable to Business X (after application of the exclusions under  section 1402(a)(1)-(17)), and the items of income, loss, gain, and  deduction that comprise B's $70,000 distributable share attributable to  B's general partnership interest (after application of the exclusions  under section 1402(a)(1)-(17)). Rather, only items of income, loss,  gain, and deduction from the two separate businesses that were excluded  from the calculation of B's net earnings from self-employment income due  to the application of the exclusions under section 1402(a)(1)-(17), such  as any capital gains and losses excluded under section 1402(a)(3), are  considered for purposes of calculating B's net investment income for  Year 1 in connection with these two trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Special rule for trader with single trade or business. D  is an individual engaged in the trade or business of trading in  commodities (as described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)). D made a valid and  timely election under section 475(f)(2). D derives $400,000 of trading  gains, which are gross income described in Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1) and  $15,000 of expenses described in Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii) from carrying  on the trade or business. Pursuant to sections 475(f)(1)(D) and  1402(a)(3)(A), none of the gross income is taken into account in  determining D's net earnings from self-employment and self-employment  income. Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the $400,000 of  gross income is not covered by the exception in section 1411(c)(6).  Because D had $0 net earnings from self-employment, the $15,000 of  deductions did not reduce D's net earnings from self-employment under  paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 1.1411-(4)(f)(2)(ii). Therefore,  the $15,000 of deductions may reduce D's gross income of $400,000 for  purposes of section 1411.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Special rule for trader with multiple trades or  businesses. E is an individual engaged in two trades or businesses,  Business X (which is not a trade or business of trading in financial  instruments or commodities) and Business Y (which is a trade or business  of trading in financial instruments or commodities (as described in  Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)). E made a valid and timely election under section  475(f) with respect to Business Y. During Year 1, E had net earnings  from self-employment from Business X of $35,000. During Year 1, E also  had $300,000 of trading gains, which are gross income described in  Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1) and $40,000 of expenses described in Sec. 1.1411- 4(f)(2)(ii) from Business Y. E's $300,000 of gross income from Business  Y is excluded from net earnings from self-employment and self-employment  income pursuant to sections 475(f)(1)(D) and 1402(a)(3)(A). E's $40,000  of deductions from Business Y reduce E's $35,000 of net earnings from  self-employment from Business X to $0. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section and Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii), the remaining $5,000 of deductions  from Business Y are taken into account in determining E's net investment  income (by reducing E's gross income of $300,000 from Business Y to  $295,000) for purposes of section 1411.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply  this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, in  accordance with Sec. 1.1411-1(f).  [T.D. 9644, 78 FR 72424, Dec. 2, 2013]</p>
