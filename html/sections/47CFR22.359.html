                            <p class="depth0">The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Public Mobile Services, except for the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service (see Sec. 22.861, instead) and the Cellular Radiotelephone Service (see Sec. 22.917, instead).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Out of band emissions. The power of any emission outside of the authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 30 kHz or more. In the 60 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the authorized frequency range or channel, a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e., 30 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in the Public Mobile Services may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be used at specified frequencies (band edges) in specified geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interference caused by out of band emissions. If any emission from a transmitter operating in any of the Public Mobile Services results in interference to users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.
