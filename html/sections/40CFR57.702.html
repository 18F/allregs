If a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, compliance with the requirements of subpart C which were deferred as a result of such request shall be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after, but in no case later than 6 months from a final decision by the issuing agency to deny a waiver under subpart H or disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency. The time limits specified herein may be extended only if a smelter operator demonstrates that special circumstances warrant more time, in which case the compliance schedule shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable. An NSO which does not contain a schedule for compliance with all the requirements of subpart C because a waiver has been requested in accordance with subpart H shall be amended in accordance with Sec. 57.104 within three months after a final decision under subpart H so as to either grant a waiver of any remaining requirements of subpart C, or deny such a waiver and place the smelter on a compliance schedule for meeting those requirements. If the issuing agency grants a waiver and such waiver is disapproved by EPA, the issuing agency shall promptly amend the NSO so as to place the smelter on a compliance schedule meeting any remaining requirements of subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any schedule required under this section shall contain the following information and increments of progress to the extent applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description of the overall design of the SO2 control system(s) to be installed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Descriptions of specific process hardware to be used in achieving compliance with interim SO2 constant controls including gas capacity values;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date by which contracts will be let or purchase orders issued to accomplish any necessary performance improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date for initiating on-site construction or installation of necessary equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date by which on-site construction or installation of equipment is to be completed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The date for achievement of final compliance with interim emission limitations.</p>
