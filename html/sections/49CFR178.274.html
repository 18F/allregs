(1) The design temperature range for the shell must be -40 C to 50 C (-40 F to 122 F) for hazardous materials transported under normal conditions of transportation, except for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases where the minimum design temperature must not be higher than the lowest (coldest) temperature (for example, service temperature) of the contents during filling, discharge or transportation. For hazardous materials handled under elevated temperature conditions, the design temperature must not be less than the maximum temperature of the hazardous material during filling, discharge or transportation. More severe design temperatures must be considered for portable tanks subjected to severe climatic conditions (for example, portable tanks transported in arctic regions). Shells must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), except as limited or modified in this subchapter. For portable tanks used for liquid or solid hazardous materials, a design code other than the ASME Code may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tanks must have an ASME certification and U stamp when used for Hazard Zone A or B toxic by inhalation liquids, or when used for non-refrigerated or refrigerated liquefied compressed gases. Shells must be made of metallic materials suitable for forming. Non-metallic materials may be used for the attachments and supports between the shell and jacket, provided their material properties at the minimum and maximum design temperatures are proven to be sufficient. For welded shells, only a material whose weldability has been fully demonstrated may be used. Welds must be of high quality and conform to a level of integrity at least equivalent to the welding requirements specified in Section VIII of the ASME Code for the welding of pressure vessels. When the manufacturing process or the materials make it necessary, the shells must be suitably heat-treated to guarantee adequate toughness in the weld and in the heat-affected zones. In choosing the

material, the design temperature range must be taken into account with respect to risk of brittle fracture, stress corrosion cracking, resistance to impact, and suitability for the hazardous materials intended for transportation in the portable tank. When fine grain steel is used, the guaranteed value of the yield strength must be not more than 460 N/mm\2\ and the guaranteed value of the upper limit of the tensile strength must be not more than 725 N/mm\2\ according to the material specification. Aluminum may not be used as a construction material for the shells of portable tanks intended for the transport of non-refrigerated liquefied gases. For portable tanks intended for the transport of liquid or solid hazardous materials, aluminum may only be used as a construction material for portable tank shells if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tank materials must be suitable for the external environment where they will be transported, taking into account the determined design temperature range. Portable tanks shall be designed to withstand, without loss of contents, at least the internal pressure due to the contents and the static, dynamic and thermal loads during normal conditions of handling and transportation. The design must take into account the effects of fatigue, caused by repeated application of these loads through the expected life of the portable tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The design temperature range for the shell must be -40 C to 50 C (-40 F to 122 F) for hazardous materials transported under normal conditions of transportation, except for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases where the minimum design temperature must not be higher than the lowest (coldest) temperature (for example, service temperature) of the contents during filling, discharge or transportation.

The forces and safety factors specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, respectively, must be taken into account in this aspect of the design. Skids, frameworks, cradles or other similar structures are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The combined stresses caused by portable tank mountings (for example, cradles, framework, etc.) and portable tank lifting and tie-down attachments must not cause stress that would damage the shell in a manner that would compromise its lading retention capability. Permanent lifting and tie-down attachments must be fitted to all portable tanks. Preferably they should be fitted to the portable tank supports but may be secured to reinforcing plates located on the shell at the points of support. Each portable tank must be designed so that the center of gravity of the filled tank is approximately centered within the points of attachment for lifting devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the design of supports and frameworks, the effects of environmental corrosion must be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Forklift pockets must be capable of being closed off. The means of closing forklift pockets must be a permanent part of the framework or permanently attached to the framework. Single compartment portable tanks with a length less than 3.65 m (12 ft.) need not have forklift pockets that are capable of being closed off provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The shell, including all the fittings, are well protected from being hit by the forklift blades; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The distance between forklift pockets (measured from the center of each pocket) is at least half of the maximum length of the portable tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> During transport, portable tanks must be adequately protected against damage to the shell, and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact and overturning, or the shell and service equipment must be constructed to withstand the forces resulting from impact or overturning. External fittings must be protected so as to preclude the release of the shell contents upon impact or overturning of the portable tank on its fittings. Examples of protection include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Protection against lateral impact which may consist of longitudinal bars protecting the shell on both sides at the level of the median line;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Protection of the portable tank against overturning which may consist of reinforcement rings or bars fixed across the frame;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Protection against rear impact which may consist of a bumper or frame;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Protection of the shell against damage from impact or overturning by use of an ISO frame in accordance with ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Protection of the portable tank from impact or damage that may result from overturning by an insulation jacket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Marking. (1) Every portable tank must be fitted with a corrosion resistant metal plate permanently attached to the portable tank in a conspicuous place and readily accessible for inspection. When the plate cannot be permanently attached to the shell, the shell must be marked with at least the information required by Section VIII of the ASME Code. At a minimum, the following information must be marked on the plate by stamping or by any other equivalent method:
Country of manufactureU NApproval CountryApproval NumberAlternative Arrangements (see Sec. 178.274(a)(2)) ``AA''Manufacturer's name or markManufacturer's serial numberApproval Agency (Authorized body for the design approval)

Owner's registration numberYear of manufacturePressure vessel code to which the shell is designedTest pressure--------bar gauge.MAWP--------bar gauge.External design pressure (not required for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases)--------bar gauge.Design temperature range-------- C to-------- C. (For portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases, the minimum design temperature must be marked.)Water capacity at 20 C/--------liters.Water capacity of each compartment at 20 C--------liters.Initial pressure test date and witness identification.MAWP for heating/cooling system--------bar gauge.Shell material(s) and material standard reference(s).Equivalent thickness in reference steel--------mm.Lining material (when applicable).Date and type of most recent periodic test(s).Month--------Year-------- Test pressure--------bar gauge.Stamp of approval agency that performed or witnessed the most recent test.</p><p class="depth0">For portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases:
Either ``thermally insulated'' or ``vacuum insulated''--------.Effectiveness of the insulation system (heat influx)--------Watts (W).Reference holding time--------days or hours and initial pressure--------bar/kPa gauge and degree of filling--------in kg for each refrigerated liquefied gas permitted for transportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following information must be marked either on the portable tank itself or on a metal plate firmly secured to the portable tank:
Name of the operator.Name of hazardous materials being transported and maximum mean bulk temperature (except for refrigerated liquefied gases, the name and temperature are only required when the maximum mean bulk temperature is higher than 50 C).Maximum permissible gross mass (MPGM)--------kg.Unladen (tare) mass--------kg.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (i)(2):</p><p class="depth0">For the identification of the hazardous materials being transported refer to part 172 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a portable tank is designed and approved for open seas operations, such as offshore oil exploration, in accordance with the IMDG Code, the words ``OFFSHORE PORTABLE TANK'' must be marked on the identification plate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Initial inspection and test. The initial inspection and test of a portable tank must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A check of the design characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An internal and external examination of the portable tank and its fittings, taking into account the hazardous materials to be transported. For UN portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases, a pressure test using an inert gas may be conducted instead of a hydrostatic test. An internal inspection is not required for a portable tank used for the dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases that are not filled with an inspection opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A pressure test as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A leakage test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment including pressure relief devices must also be performed. When the shell and its fittings have been pressure-tested separately, they must be subjected to a leakage test after reassembly. All welds, subject to full stress level in the shell, must be inspected during the initial test by radiographic, ultrasonic, or another suitable non-destructive test method. This does not apply to the jacket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective January 1, 2008, each new UN portable tank design type meeting the definition of ``container'' in the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) (see 49 CFR 450.3(a)(2)) must be subjected to the dynamic longitudinal impact test prescribed in Part IV, Section 40 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (see IBR, Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). A UN portable tank design type impact-tested prior to January 1, 2008, in accordance with the requirements of this section in effect on October 1, 2005, need not be retested. UN portable tanks used for the dedicated transportation of ``Helium, refrigerated liquid,'' UN1963, and ``Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid,'' UN1966, that are marked ``NOT FOR RAIL TRANSPORT'' in letters of a minimum height of 10 cm (4 inches) on at least two sides of the portable tank are excepted from the dynamic longitudinal impact test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The following tests must be completed on a portable tank or a series of portable tanks designed and constructed to a single design type that is also a CSC container without leakage or deformation that would render the portable tank unsafe for transportation and use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Longitudinal inertia. The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned with its longitudinal axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower end of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper end of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lateral inertia. The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned for five minutes with its transverse axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower side of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper side of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.
