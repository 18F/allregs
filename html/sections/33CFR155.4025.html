This agreement must expressly provide that the resource provider is capable of, and intends to commit to, meeting the plan requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A written certification that the personnel, equipment, and capabilities required by this subpart are available and under the vessel owner or operator's direct control. If the planholder has personnel, equipment and capabilities under their direct control, they need not contract those items with a resource provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> An alternative approved by the Coast Guard (Commandant, Director of Prevention Policy (CG-54)) and submitted in accordance with 33 CFR 155.1065(f) and 155.5067(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> As part of the contract or other approved means you must develop and sign, with your resource provider, a written funding agreement.

This is to ensure that a vessel can be stabilized, controlled or removed from a grounded position. Towing vessels must have the proper horsepower or bollard pull compatible with the size and tonnage of the vessel to be assisted.</p><p class="depth2">External emergency transfer operations means the use of external pumping equipment placed on board a vessel to move oil from one tank to another, when the vessel's own transfer equipment is not working.</p><p class="depth2">External firefighting teams means trained firefighting personnel, aside from the crew, with the capability of boarding and combating a fire on a vessel.</p><p class="depth2">External vessel firefighting systems mean firefighting resources (personnel and equipment) that are capable of combating a fire from other than on board the vessel. These resources include, but are not limited to, fire tugs, portable fire pumps, airplanes, helicopters, or shore side fire trucks.</p><p class="depth2">Funding agreement is a written agreement between a resource provider and a planholder that identifies agreed upon rates for specific equipment and services to be made available by the resource provider under the agreement.

It should be designed for use in conjunction with other state, regional and local contingency and resource mobilization plans.</p><p class="depth2">Nearshore area means the area extending seaward 12 miles from the boundary lines defined in 46 CFR part 7, except in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, a nearshore area is one extending seaward 12 miles from the line of demarcation (COLREG lines) as defined in Secs. 80.740 through 80.850 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Offshore area means the area up to 38 nautical miles seaward of the outer boundary of the nearshore area.</p><p class="depth2">On-site fire assessment means that a marine firefighting professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who can determine the steps needed to control and extinguish a marine fire in accordance with a vessel's stability and structural integrity assessment if necessary.</p><p class="depth2">On-site salvage assessment means that a salvage professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who has the ability to assess the vessel's stability and structural integrity.

each of the COTP zones in which a vessel operates. The primary resource provider will be the point of contact for the planholder, the Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) and the Unified Command, in matters related to specific resources and services, as required in Sec. 155.4030(a).</p><p class="depth2">Remote assessment and consultation means contacting the salvage and/or marine firefighting resource providers, by phone or other means of communications to discuss and assess the situation.

These actions can include pumping or other means to transfer the oil to a storage device.</p><p class="depth2">Underwater vessel and bottom survey means having salvage resources on scene that can perform examination and analysis of the vessel's hull and equipment below the water surface. These resources also include the ability to determine the bottom configuration and type for the body of water.

When divers are used to perform these services, the time requirements for this service apply and not those of diving services support.
