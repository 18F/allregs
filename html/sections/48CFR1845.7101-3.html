                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The unit acquisition cost shall include all costs incurred to  bring the property to a form and location suitable for its intended use.  The following is representative of the types of costs that shall be  included, when applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts paid to vendors or other contractors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation charges to the point of initial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Handling and storage charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for assets  produced or constructed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Engineering, architectural, and other outside services for  designs, plans, specifications, and surveys.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other  facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and facilities  used in construction work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for  activities in a building or facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Direct costs of inspection, supervision, and administration of  construction contracts and construction work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Legal and recording fees and damage claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Fair values of facilities and equipment donated to the  Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition cost shall include, where appropriate, for  contractor acquired property, related fees, or a pro rata portion of  fees, paid by NASA to the contractor. Situations where inclusion of fees  in the acquisition cost would be appropriate are those in which the  contractor designs, develops, fabricates or purchases property for NASA  and part of the fees paid to the contractor by NASA are related to that  effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition cost shall be developed using actual costs to the  greatest extent possible, especially costs directly related to  fabrication such as labor and materials. Where estimates are used, there  must be a documented methodology based on a historical basis. All  acquisition costs shall be properly documented, supported and retained.  Supporting documentation shall be made available upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The use of weighted average methodologies is acceptable for  valuation of Material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contractors shall report unit acquisition costs using records  that are part of the prescribed property or financial control system as  provided in this section. Fabrication costs shall be based on approved  systems or procedures and include all direct and indirect costs of  fabrication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Only modifications that improve an item's capacity or extend its  useful life two years or more and that cost $500,000 or more shall be  reported on the NF 1018 on the $500,000 & Over line. The costs of any  other modifications, excluding routine maintenance, will be reported on  the Under $500,000 line. If an item's original unit acquisition cost   is less than $500,000, but a single subsequent modification costs  $500,000 or more, that modification only will be reported as an item  $500,000 or more on subsequent NF 1018s. The original acquisition cost  of the item will continue to be included in the under $500,000 total.  The quantity for the modified item will remain ``1'' and be reported  with the original acquisition cost of the item. If an item's acquisition  cost is reduced by removal of components so that its remaining  acquisition cost is under $500,000, it shall be reported as under  $500,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Software acquisition costs include software costs incurred up  through acceptance testing and material internal costs incurred to  implement the software and otherwise make the software ready for use.  Costs incurred after acceptance testing are excluded. License,  maintenance, training, and data conversion costs are also excluded. If  the software is purchased as part of a package, the costs will need to  be segregated in such manner as to ensure that the excluded costs  (maintenance, training, etc.) are not reported as part of the software's  acquisition cost. Enhancement costs for existing software should be  added to the acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant  additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally  developed (i.e. a capability that was not included in the original  software specifications), the total cost of the enhancement is  $1,000,000 or more, and the expected useful life of the enhanced  software is 2 years or more. Include the same types of cost as indicated  above under new software. Costs incurred solely to repair a design flaw  or perform minor upgrades should not be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The computation of work in process (WIP) shall include all  direct and indirect costs of fabrication, including associated systems,  subsystems, and spare parts and components furnished or acquired and  charged to work in process pending incorporation into a finished item.  These types of items make up what is sometimes called production  inventory and include programmed extra units to cover replacement during  the fabrication process (production spares). Also included are  deliverable items on which the contractor or a subcontractor has begun  work, and materials issued from inventory. The computation of WIP shall  incorporate the other requirements for unit acquisition cost as outlined  in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. In addition, acquisition  cost of property furnished by the Government, which has been  incorporated in the property item under construction or in process of  fabrication, should be included. Do not include costs for operation or  repairing existing completed property items. Once the property is  complete, include all the costs outlined above in its acquisition value  in the property record. The WIP values are inception to date until such  time as the WIP is completed. It does not include future costs.  [65 FR 54815, Sept. 11, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41806, Aug. 9, 2001;  67 FR 68534, Nov. 12, 2002; 68 FR 62025, Oct. 31, 2003; 80 FR 51958,  Aug. 27, 2015]</p>
