                            <p class="depth0">The requirements of this subpart apply to any request by a  mortgagor, as provided by Sec. 245.10, for HUD approval of one or more  of the following covered actions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conversion of a project from project-paid utilities to tenant- paid utilities, or a reduction in tenant utility allowances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conversion of residential units in a multifamily housing project  to a nonresidential use or to condominiums, or the transfer of the  project to a cooperative housing mortgagor corporation or association.  Conversion of a project to a cooperative or of a portion of a project to  nonresidential use does not constitute a change of use requiring  mortgagee approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A partial release of mortgage security. The requirements of this  subpart, however, do not apply to any release of property from a  mortgage lien with respect to a utility easement or a public taking of  such property by condemnation or eminent domain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Making major capital additions to the project. For the purposes  of this subpart, the term ``major capital additions'' includes only  those capital improvements that represent a substantial addition to the  project. Upgrading or replacing existing capital components of the  project does not constitute a major capital addition to the project.</p>
