                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recommendation of port director. The port director may at any time recommend to the Board that the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a zone or subzone under CBP jurisdiction be revoked for willful and repeated violations of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81r). If the port director believes that a substantial question of law exists as to whether willful and repeated violations of the Act have occurred, that officer may request internal advice under the provisions of part 177 of this chapter from the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters. A recommendation to the Board that a zone or subzone grant be revoked does not preclude, and may be in addition to, any liquidated damages, penalty, or suspension for cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision of the Board. The procedure for revocation of a grant, the decision of the Board, and appeal is covered by the provisions of the Act and title 15, chapter IV, part 400, Code of Federal Regulations.
