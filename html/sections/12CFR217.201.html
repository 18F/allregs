                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart F establishes risk-based capital  requirements for Board-regulated institutions with significant exposure  to market risk, provides methods for these Board-regulated institutions  to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if  applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public  disclosure requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This subpart applies to any Board-regulated  institution with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as  reported in the Board-regulated institution's most recent quarterly Call  Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company  or savings and loan holding company, as applicable, any savings and loan  holding company that does not file the FR Y-9C should follow the  instructions to the FR Y-9C) equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on  the most recent quarterly [Call Report or FR Y-9C]; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $1 billion or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board may apply this subpart to any Board-regulated  institution if the Board deems it necessary or appropriate because of  the level of market risk of the Board-regulated institution or to ensure  safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board may exclude a Board-regulated institution that meets  the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of  this subpart if the Board determines that the exclusion is appropriate  based on the level of   market risk of the Board-regulated institution and is consistent with  safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section,  the Board will apply notice and response procedures generally in the  same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in 12 CFR  263.202.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Board determines that the risk-based capital requirement  calculated under this subpart by the Board-regulated institution for one  or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not  commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or  portfolios, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to  assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or  portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or  portfolios.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board may also require a Board-regulated institution to  calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or  portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this  part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the  positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the Board under  any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or  enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound  practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.
