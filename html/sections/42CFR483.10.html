                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The resident has a right to a dignified existence, self-determination, and communication with and access to persons and services inside and outside the facility. A facility must protect and promote the rights of each resident, including each of the following rights:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exercise of rights. (1) The resident has the right to exercise his or her rights as a resident of the facility and as a citizen or resident of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from the facility in exercising his or her rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a resident adjudged incompetent under the laws of a State by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the resident are exercised by the person appointed under State law to act on the resident's behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a resident who has not been adjudged incompetent by the State court, any legal-surrogate designated in accordance with State law may exercise the resident's rights to the extent provided by State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice of rights and services. (1) The facility must inform the resident both orally and in writing in a language that the resident understands of his or her rights and all rules and regulations governing resident conduct and responsibilities during the stay in the facility. The facility must also provide the resident with the notice (if any) of the State developed under section 1919(e)(6) of the Act. Such notification must be made prior to or upon admission and during the resident's stay. Receipt of such information, and any amendments to it, must be acknowledged in writing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The resident or his or her legal representative has the right--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon an oral or written request, to access all records pertaining to himself or herself including current clinical records within 24 hours (excluding weekends and holidays); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After receipt of his or her records for inspection, to purchase at a cost not to exceed the community standard photocopies of the records or any portions of them upon request and 2 working days advance notice to the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The resident has the right to be fully informed in language that he or she can understand of his or her total health status, including but not limited to, his or her medical condition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The resident has the right to refuse treatment, to refuse to participate in experimental research, and to formulate an advance directive as specified in paragraph (8) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The facility must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inform each resident who is entitled to Medicaid benefits, in writing, at the time of admission to the nursing facility or, when the resident becomes eligible for Medicaid of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The items and services that are included in nursing facility services under the State plan and for which the resident may not be charged;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Those other items and services that the facility offers and for which

the resident may be charged, and the amount of charges for those services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inform each resident when changes are made to the items and services specified in paragraphs (5)(i) (A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The facility must inform each resident before, or at the time of admission, and periodically during the resident's stay, of services available in the facility and of charges for those services, including any charges for services not covered under Medicare or by the facility's per diem rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The facility must furnish a written description of legal rights which includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the manner of protecting personal funds, under paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the requirements and procedures for establishing eligibility for Medicaid, including the right to request an assessment under section 1924(c) which determines the extent of a couple's non-exempt resources at the time of institutionalization and attributes to the community spouse an equitable share of resources which cannot be considered available for payment toward the cost of the institutionalized spouse's medical care in his or her process of spending down to Medicaid eligibility levels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A posting of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all pertinent State client advocacy groups such as the State survey and certification agency, the State licensure office, the State ombudsman program, the protection and advocacy network, and the Medicaid fraud control unit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the resident may file a complaint with the State survey and certification agency concerning resident abuse, neglect, misappropriation of resident property in the facility, and non-compliance with the advance directives requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The facility must comply with the requirements specified in subpart I of part 489 of this chapter relating to maintaining written policies and procedures regarding advance directives. These requirements include provisions to inform and provide written information to all adult residents concerning the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and, at the individual's option, formulate an advance directive. This includes a written description of the facility's policies to implement advance directives and applicable State law. Facilities are permitted to contract with other entities to furnish this information but are still legally responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this section are met. If an adult individual is incapacitated at the time of admission and is unable to receive information (due to the incapacitating condition or a mental disorder) or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance directive, the facility may give advance directive information to the individual's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law. The facility is not relieved of its obligation to provide this information to the individual once he or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. Follow-up procedures must be in place to provide the information to the individual directly at the appropriate time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The facility must inform each resident of the name, specialty, and way of contacting the physician responsible for his or her care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The facility must prominently display in the facility written information, and provide to residents and applicants for admission oral and written information about how to apply for and use Medicare and Medicaid benefits, and how to receive refunds for previous payments covered by such benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Notification of changes. (i) A facility must immediately inform the resident; consult with the resident's physician; and if known, notify the resident's legal respresentative or an interested family member when there is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An accident involving the resident which results in injury and has the potential for requiring physician intervention;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A significant change in the resident's physical, mental, or psychosocial status (i.e., a deterioration in health, mental, or psychosocial status

in either life-threatening conditions or clinical complications);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A need to alter treatment significantly (i.e., a need to discontinue an existing form of treatment due to adverse consequences, or to commence a new form of treatment); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A decision to transfer or discharge the resident from the facility as specified in Sec. 483.12(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facility must also promptly notify the resident and, if known, the resident's legal representative or interested family member when there is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A change in room or roommate assignment as specified in Sec. 483.15(e)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A change in resident rights under Federal or State law or regulations as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facility must record and periodically update the address and phone number of the resident's legal representative or interested family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Admission to a composite distinct part. A facility that is a composite distinct part (as defined in Sec. 483.5(c) of this subpart) must disclose in its admission agreement its physical configuration, including the various locations that comprise the composite distinct part, and must specify the policies that apply to room changes between its different locations under Sec. 483.12(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protection of resident funds. (1) The resident has the right to manage his or her financial affairs, and the facility may not require residents to deposit their personal funds with the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Management of personal funds. Upon written authorization of a resident, the facility must hold, safeguard, manage, and account for the personal funds of the resident deposited with the facility, as specified in paragraphs (c)(3)-(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deposit of funds. (i) Funds in excess of $50. The facility must deposit any residents' personal funds in excess of $50 in an interest bearing account (or accounts) that is separate from any of the facility's operating accounts, and that credits all interest earned on resident's funds to that account. (In pooled accounts, there must be a separate accounting for each resident's share.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Funds less than $50. The facility must maintain a resident's personal funds that do not exceed $50 in a non-interest bearing account, interest-bearing account, or petty cash fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Accounting and records. The facility must establish and maintain a system that assures a full and complete and separate accounting, according to generally accepted accounting principles, of each resident's personal funds entrusted to the facility on the resident's behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The system must preclude any commingling of resident funds with facility funds or with the funds of any person other than another resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The individual financial record must be available through quarterly statements and on request to the resident or his or her legal representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice of certain balances. The facility must notify each resident that receives Medicaid benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the amount in the resident's account reaches $200 less than the SSI resource limit for one person, specified in section 1611(a)(3)(B) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That, if the amount in the account, in addition to the value of the resident's other nonexempt resources, reaches the SSI resource limit for one person, the resident may lose eligibility for Medicaid or SSI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conveyance upon death. Upon the death of a resident with a personal fund deposited with the facility, the facility must convey within 30 days the resident's funds, and a final accounting of those funds, to the individual or probate jurisdiction administering the resident's estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Assurance of financial security. The facility must purchase a surety bond, or otherwise provide assurance satisfactory to the Secretary, to assure the security of all personal funds of residents deposited with the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Limitation on charges to personal funds. The facility may not impose a charge against the personal funds of a resident for any item or service for which payment is made under Medicaid or Medicare (except for applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts). The facility may charge the resident for requested services that are more expensive than or in excess of covered services in accordance with Sec. 489.32 of

this chapter. (This does not affect the prohibition on facility charges for items and services for which Medicaid has paid. See Sec. 447.15, which limits participation in the Medicaid program to providers who accept, as payment in full, Medicaid payment plus any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Services included in Medicare or Medicaid payment. During the course of a covered Medicare or Medicaid stay, facilities may not charge a resident for the following categories of items and services:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nursing services as required at Sec. 483.30 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dietary services as required at Sec. 483.35 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An activities program as required at Sec. 483.15(f) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Room/bed maintenance services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Routine personal hygiene items and services as required to meet the needs of residents, including, but not limited to, hair hygiene supplies, comb, brush, bath soap, disinfecting soaps or specialized cleansing agents when indicated to treat special skin problems or to fight infection, razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, denture adhesive, denture cleaner, dental floss, moisturizing lotion, tissues, cotton balls, cotton swabs, deodorant, incontinence care and supplies, sanitary napkins and related supplies, towels, washcloths, hospital gowns, over the counter drugs, hair and nail hygiene services, bathing, and basic personal laundry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Medically-related social services as required at Sec. 483.15(g) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items and services that may be charged to residents' funds. Listed below are general categories and examples of items and services that the facility may charge to residents' funds if they are requested by a resident, if the facility informs the resident that there will be a charge, and if payment is not made by Medicare or Medicaid:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Telephone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Television/radio for personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Personal comfort items, including smoking materials, notions and novelties, and confections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Cosmetic and grooming items and services in excess of those for which payment is made under Medicaid or Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Personal clothing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Personal reading matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Gifts purchased on behalf of a resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Flowers and plants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Social events and entertainment offered outside the scope of the activities program, provided under Sec. 483.15(f) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Noncovered special care services such as privately hired nurses or aides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Private room, except when therapeutically required (for example, isolation for infection control).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Specially prepared or alternative food requested instead of the food generally prepared by the facility, as required by Sec. 483.35 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requests for items and services.
