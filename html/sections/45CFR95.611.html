The Secretary may extend the implementation date, if the implementation date is not met because of circumstances beyond the State's control. Examples of circumstances beyond the State's control are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Equipment failure due to physical damage or destruction; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change imposed by Federal judicial decisions, or by Federal legislation or regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A significant change in procurement approach, and/or a scope of procurement activities beyond that approved in the APD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A change in system concept or scope of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A change to the approved cost methodology;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A change of more than 10% of estimated cost benefits.

If the Department has not specifically requested in a record, the submittal of additional acquisition documentation for those acquisitions summarized in the APD, the approval of the Planning, Annual or As-Needed APDU will constitute an exemption of the acquisition documents from prior Federal approval. States will be required to submit acquisition documents, contracts and contract amendments under the threshold amounts on an exception basis if requested to do so in a record by the Department.
