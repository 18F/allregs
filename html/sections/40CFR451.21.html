Employ efficient feed management and feeding  strategies that limit feed input to the minimum amount reasonably  necessary to achieve production goals and sustain targeted rates of  aquatic animal growth. These strategies must minimize the accumulation  of uneaten food beneath the pens through the use of active feed  monitoring and management practices. These practices may include one or  more of the following: Use of real-time feed monitoring, including  devices such as video cameras, digital scanning sonar, and upweller   systems; monitoring of sediment quality beneath the pens; monitoring of  benthic community quality beneath the pens; capture of waste feed and  feces; or other good husbandry practices approved by the permitting  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waste collection and disposal. Collect, return to shore, and  properly dispose of all feed bags, packaging materials, waste rope and  netting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transport or harvest discharge. Minimize any discharge  associated with the transport or harvesting of aquatic animals including  blood, viscera, aquatic animal carcasses, or transport water containing  blood.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carcass removal. Remove and dispose of aquatic animal  mortalities properly on a regular basis to prevent discharge to waters  of the U.S.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Materials storage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure proper storage of drugs,  pesticides and feed in a manner designed to prevent spills that may  result in the discharge of drugs, pesticides or feed to waters of the  U.S.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Implement procedures for properly containing, cleaning, and  disposing of any spilled material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Maintenance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspect the production system on a routine  basis in order to identify and promptly repair any damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct regular maintenance of the production system in order to  ensure that it is properly functioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to calculate representative feed  conversion ratios, maintain records for aquatic animal net pens  documenting the feed amounts and estimates of the numbers and weight of  aquatic animals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Keep records of the net changes, inspections and repairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Training. The permittee must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to ensure the proper clean-up and disposal of spilled  material adequately train all relevant facility personnel in spill  prevention and how to respond in the event of a spill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Train staff on the proper operation and cleaning of production  systems including training in feeding procedures and proper use of  equipment.</p>
