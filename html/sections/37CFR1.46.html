                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person to whom the inventor has assigned or is under an obligation to assign the invention may make an application for patent. A person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter may make an application for patent on behalf of and as agent for the inventor on proof of the pertinent facts and a showing that such action is appropriate to preserve the rights of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an application under 35 U.S.C. 111 is made by a person other than the inventor under paragraph (a) of this section, the application must contain an application data sheet under Sec.  1.76 specifying in the applicant information section (Sec.  1.76(b)(7)) the assignee, person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter. If an application entering the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371, or a nonprovisional

international design application, is applied for by a person other than the inventor under paragraph (a) of this section, the assignee, person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter must have been identified as the applicant for the United States in the international stage of the international application or as the applicant in the publication of the international registration under Hague Agreement Article 10(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the applicant is the assignee or a person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, documentary evidence of ownership (e.g., assignment for an assignee, employment agreement for a person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention) should be recorded as provided for in part 3 of this chapter no later than the date the issue fee is paid in the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant is a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter, such applicant must submit a petition including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(g);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A showing that such person has sufficient proprietary interest in the matter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement that making the application for patent by a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter on behalf of and as agent for the inventor is appropriate to preserve the rights of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Correction or update in the name of the applicant. Any request to correct or update the name of the applicant under this section must include an application data sheet under Sec.  1.76 specifying the correct or updated name of the applicant in the applicant information section (Sec.  1.76(b)(7)) in accordance with Sec.  1.76(c)(2).

Any request to correct or update the name of the applicant under this section must include an application data sheet under Sec.  1.76 specifying the correct or updated name of the applicant in the applicant information section (Sec.  1.76(b)(7)) in accordance with Sec.  1.76(c)(2).

Sec.  3.71 and 3.73 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Even if the whole or a part interest in the invention or in the patent to be issued is assigned or obligated to be assigned, an oath or declaration must be executed by the actual inventor or each actual joint inventor, except as provided for in Sec.  1.64. See Sec.  1.64 concerning the execution of a substitute statement by an assignee, person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a patent is granted on an application filed under this section by a person other than the inventor, the patent shall be granted to the real party in interest. Otherwise, the patent may be issued to the assignee or jointly to the inventor and the assignee as provided in Sec.  3.81. Where a real party in interest has filed an application under Sec.  1.46, the applicant shall notify the Office of any change in the real party in interest no later than payment of the issue fee.
