                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 48 CFR 1335.006(b), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Protection of Human Subjects (APR 2010)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractor has satisfied the requirements set forth in  solicitation --------, related to the Protection of Human  Subjects in research. The Government has determined that the research  involving human subjects to be conducted under this contract is exempt  from the requirements of the Common Rule for the Protection of Human  Subjects. The exemption memorandum executed by the Government and the  attachments are hereby incorporated by reference into this contract. If  contractor uses an informed consent form for the exempt research,  contractor must use the informed consent form contained in the  attachments in its conduct of research involving human subjects under  this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the conditions upon which the exemption is based should  change in any way, contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting  Officer in writing of the specified change. The Government will review  the change and make a determination as to whether the change requires a  change to the exemption approval. Contractor shall not proceed until  notified in writing of the Contracting Officer's approval. Contractor  shall obtain prior written approval from the Contracting Officer for any  change to the existing human subjects protocol or informed consent form  before proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No other research involving human subjects is permitted under  this award unless expressly authorized in writing by the Contracting  Officer. Such writing will specify the details of the approved research  involving human subjects and will be incorporated by reference into this  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the  ``Common Rule''), adopted by the Department of Commerce at 15 CFR Part  27, requires contractors to maintain appropriate policies and procedures  for the protection of human subjects in research. The Common Rule  defines a ``human subject'' as a living individual about whom an  investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or  interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information.  The term ``research'' means a systematic investigation, including  research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or  contribute to generalizable knowledge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Common Rule also sets forth categories of research that may  be considered exempt from this policy. These categories may be found at  15 CFR 27.101(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event the human subjects research involves pregnant  women, prisoners, or children, contractor is also required to follow the  guidelines set forth at 45 CFR part 46 subpart B, C and D, as  appropriate, for the protection of members of a protected class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Should additional research involving human subjects be required  under the contract, prior to beginning such research, contractor shall  submit the following documentation to the Contracting Officer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documentation to verify that contractor has established a  relationship with an appropriate Institutional Review Board (``cognizant  IRB''). An appropriate IRB is one that is located within the United  States and within the community in which the human subjects research  will be conducted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation to verify that the cognizant IRB is registered  with the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office  for Human Research Protections (``OHRP'') and is designated as  contractor's cognizant IRB;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation to verify that contractor has a valid Federal-wide  Assurance (FWA) issued by OHRP; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation necessary to support a determination that the  research is exempt from the requirements of the Common Rule for the  Protection of Human Subjects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prior to starting any additional research involving human  subjects, the contractor shall submit appropriate documentation to the  Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval or exemption  determination. This documentation may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies of the human subjects research protocol, all  questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms  approved by the cognizant IRB;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation of approval for the human subjects research  protocol, questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent  forms by the cognizant IRB;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation of continuing IRB approval by the cognizant IRB at  appropriate intervals as designated by the IRB, but not less than  annually; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation to support an exemption for the project from the  Common Rule [Note: this option is not available for activities that fall  under 45 CFR part 46 subpart C].</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition, if the contractor modifies a human subjects  research protocol, questionnaire, survey, advertisement, or informed  consent form approved by the cognizant IRB, the contractor shall submit  a copy of all   modified material along with documentation of approval for said  modification by the cognizant IRB to the Contracting Officer for  institutional review and approval. The contractor may not implement any  IRB approved modification without written approval by the Contracting  Officer.</p><p class="depth4">No work involving human subjects may be undertaken, conducted, or  costs incurred and/or charged to the project, until the Contracting  Officer approves the required appropriate documentation in writing.</p><p class="depth4">(End of clause)  [75 FR 10570, Mar. 8, 2010; 75 FR 14496, Mar. 26, 2010]</p>
