Exportation of a vehicle will be permitted only upon compliance with these requirements, unless the vehicle was entered into the United States under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond; a vehicle entered under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond is exempt from these requirements. The person attempting to export the vehicle may employ an agent for the exportation of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documentation required--(1) For U.S.-titled vehicles--(i) Vehicles issued an original certificate of title.

If the used, self-propelled vehicle is leased or a recorded

lien exists in the U.S., in addition to complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the provisional owner must provide to Customs a separate writing from the third-party-in-interest which expressly provides that the subject vehicle may be exported. This writing must be on the third-party's letterhead paper, and contain a complete description of the vehicle including the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the name of the owner or lienholder of the leased vehicle, and the telephone numbers at which that owner or lienholder may be contacted. The writing must bear an original signature of the third-party and state the date it was signed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where U.S. Government employees are involved.

For newly-manufactured, self-propelled vehicles that are purchased from a U.S. manufacturer, distributor, or dealer that become used, as defined in this subpart, and are issued a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO), but not issued a Certificate of Title by any jurisdiction of the United States, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original MSO and two complete copies of the original MSO.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Newly-manufactured vehicles issued an MSO. For newly-manufactured, self-propelled vehicles that are purchased from a U.S. manufacturer, distributor, or dealer that become used, as defined in this subpart, and are issued a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO), but not issued a Certificate of Title by any jurisdiction of the United States, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original MSO and two complete copies of the original MSO.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Newly-manufactured vehicles not issued an MSO.

For used, self-propelled vehicles that were issued, by any jurisdiction of the United States, a title or certificate that is no longer in force, or that are not required to be titled or registered, and for which an MSO was not issued, the owner must establish that the jurisdiction from where the vehicle comes does not have any ownership documentation requirements regarding such vehicles and provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original document that shows his basis for ownership or right of possession, such as a bill of sale, and two complete copies of that original document. Further, the owner must certify in writing to Customs that the procurement of the vehicle was a bona fide transaction, and that the vehicle presented for export is not stolen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When presented--(1) Exportation by vessel or aircraft. For those vehicles exported by vessel or aircraft, the required documentation and the vehicle must be presented to Customs at least 72 hours prior to export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exportation by vessel or aircraft.

Port directors will establish locations at which exporters must present the required documentation and the vehicles for inspection. Port directors will publicize these locations, including their hours of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authentication of documentation. Customs will determine the authenticity of the documents submitted. Once the authenticity of the documents is established, Customs will mark the documents. In most cases the original document(s) will be returned to the exporter. In those cases where the original title document was presented to and retained by Customs and cannot be found prior to the vehicle's export, the exporter's authenticated copy of the original documentation serves as evidence of compliance with the reporting requirements.
