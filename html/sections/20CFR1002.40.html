                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes. The Act's definition of employer includes a person,  institution, organization, or other entity that has denied initial  employment to an individual in violation of USERRA's anti-discrimination  provisions. An employer need not actually employ an individual to be his  or her ``employer'' under the Act, if it has denied initial employment  on the basis of the individual's membership, application for membership,  performance of service, application for service, or obligation for  service in the uniformed services. Similarly, the employer would be  liable if it denied initial employment on the basis of the individual's  action taken to enforce a protection afforded to any person under  USERRA, his or her testimony or statement in connection with any USERRA  proceeding, assistance or other participation in a USERRA investigation,  or the exercise of any other right provided by the Act. For example, if  the individual has been denied initial employment because of his or her  obligations as a member of the National Guard or Reserves, the company  or entity denying employment is an employer for purposes of USERRA.  Similarly, if an entity withdraws an offer of employment because the  individual is called upon to fulfill an obligation in the uniformed  services, the entity withdrawing the employment offer is an employer for  purposes of USERRA.</p>
