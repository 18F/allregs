Any such regulations may not be enforced prior to approval by the Administrator or prior to 60 days after submission if not disapproved by the Administrator. Currently existing regulations are not affected by this section, except where such regulations are not in conformity with the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and the Department of Labor regulations. In such cases, agency regulations shall be appropriately revised.
