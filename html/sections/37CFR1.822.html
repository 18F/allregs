                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino  acid sequence data shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (b)  through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The code for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid  sequence characters shall conform to the code set forth in the tables in  WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 3. This  incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal  Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of  ST.25 may be obtained from the World Intellectual Property Organization;  34 chemin des Colombettes; 1211 Geneva 20 Switzerland. Copies may also  be inspected at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202- 741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of-- federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html. No code other than that  specified in these sections shall be used in nucleotide and amino acid  sequences. A modified base or modified or unusual amino acid may be  presented in a given sequence as the corresponding unmodified base or  amino acid if the modified base or modified or unusual amino acid is one  of those listed in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 2 and  4, and the modification is also set forth in the Feature section.  Otherwise, each occurrence of a base or amino acid not appearing in WIPO  Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 3, shall be listed in a  given sequence as ``n'' or ``Xaa,'' respectively, with further  information, as appropriate, given in the Feature section, preferably by  including one or more feature keys listed in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998),  Appendix 2, Tables 5 and 6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Format representation of nucleotides. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A nucleotide sequence  shall be listed using the lower-case letter for representing the one- letter code for the nucleotide bases set forth in WIPO Standard ST.25  (1998), Appendix 2, Table 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bases in a nucleotide sequence (including introns) shall be  listed in groups of 10 bases except in the coding parts of the sequence.  Leftover bases, fewer than 10 in number, at the end of noncoding parts  of a sequence shall be grouped together and separated from adjacent  groups of 10 or 3 bases by a space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bases in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be  listed as triplets (codons). The amino acids corresponding to the codons  in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be typed immediately  below the corresponding codons. Where a codon spans an intron, the amino  acid symbol shall be typed below the portion of the codon containing two  nucleotides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A nucleotide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16  codons or 60 bases per line, with a space provided between each codon or  group of 10 bases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A nucleotide sequence shall be presented, only by a single  strand, in the 5 to 3 direction, from left to right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The enumeration of nucleotide bases shall start at the first  base of the sequence with number 1. The enumeration shall be continuous  through the whole sequence in the direction 5 to 3. The enumeration  shall be marked in the right margin, next to the line containing the  one-letter codes for the bases, and giving the number of the last base  of that line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For those nucleotide sequences that are circular in  configuration, the enumeration method set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of  this section remains applicable with the exception that the designation  of the first base of the nucleotide sequence may be made at the option  of the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Representation of amino acids. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amino acids in a protein  or peptide sequence shall be listed using the three-letter abbreviation  with the first   letter as an upper case character, as in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998),  Appendix 2, Table 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A protein or peptide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of  16 amino acids per line, with a space provided between each amino acid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amino acid sequence shall be presented in the amino to  carboxy direction, from left to right, and the amino and carboxy groups  shall not be presented in the sequence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The enumeration of amino acids may start at the first amino acid  of the first mature protein, with the number 1. When presented, the  amino acids preceding the mature protein, e.g., pre-sequences, pro- sequences, pre-pro-sequences and signal sequences, shall have negative  numbers, counting backwards starting with the amino acid next to number  1. Otherwise, the enumeration of amino acids shall start at the first  amino acid at the amino terminal as number 1. It shall be marked below  the sequence every 5 amino acids. The enumeration method for amino acid  sequences that is set forth in this section remains applicable for amino  acid sequences that are circular in configuration, with the exception  that the designation of the first amino acid of the sequence may be made  at the option of the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An amino acid sequence that contains internal terminator symbols  (e.g., ``Ter'', ``*'', or ``.'', etc.) may not be represented as a  single amino acid sequence, but shall be presented as separate amino  acid sequences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A sequence with a gap or gaps shall be presented as a plurality  of separate sequences, with separate sequence identifiers, with the  number of separate sequences being equal in number to the number of  continuous strings of sequence data. A sequence that is made up of one  or more noncontiguous segments of a larger sequence or segments from  different sequences shall be presented as a separate sequence.
