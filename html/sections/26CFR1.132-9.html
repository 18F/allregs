What is the effective date of this section?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Questions and answers.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1. What is a qualified transportation fringe?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. (a) The following benefits are qualified transportation fringe  benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transit passes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualified parking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An employer may simultaneously provide an employee with any one  or more of these three benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. What is transportation in a commuter highway vehicle?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is transportation  provided by an employer to an employee in connection with travel between  the employee's residence and place of employment. A commuter highway  vehicle is a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of at least 6  adults (excluding the driver) and with respect to which at least 80  percent of the vehicle's mileage for a year is reasonably expected to  be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For transporting employees in connection with travel between  their residences and their place of employment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On trips during which the number of employees transported for  commuting is at least one-half of the adult   seating capacity of the vehicle (excluding the driver).</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. What are transit passes?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or  similar item (including an item exchangeable for fare media) that  entitles a person to transportation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On mass transit facilities (whether or not publicly owned); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Provided by any person in the business of transporting persons  for compensation or hire in a highway vehicle with a seating capacity of  at least 6 adults (excluding the driver).</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. What is qualified parking?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. (a) Qualified parking is parking provided to an employee by an  employer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On or near the employer's business premises; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At a location from which the employee commutes to work  (including commuting by carpool, commuter highway vehicle, mass transit  facilities, or transportation provided by any person in the business of  transporting persons for compensation or hire).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of section 132(f), parking on or near the  employer's business premises includes parking on or near a work location  at which the employee provides services for the employer. However,  qualified parking does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of parking provided to an employee that is excludable  from gross income under section 132(a)(3) (as a working condition  fringe), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursement paid to an employee for parking costs that is  excludable from gross income as an amount treated as paid under an  accountable plan. See Sec. 1.62-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> However, parking on or near property used by the employee for  residential purposes is not qualified parking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Parking is provided by an employer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The parking is on property that the employer owns or leases;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employer pays for the parking; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The employer reimburses the employee for parking expenses (see  Q/A-16 of this section for rules relating to cash reimbursements).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to individuals  who are not employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. An employer may provide qualified transportation fringes only  to individuals who are currently employees of the employer at the time  the qualified transportation fringe is provided. The term employee for  purposes of qualified transportation fringes is defined in Sec. 1.132- 1(b)(2)(i). This term includes only common law employees and other  statutory employees, such as officers of corporations. See Q/A-24 of  this section for rules regarding partners, 2-percent shareholders, and  independent contractors.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. Must a qualified transportation fringe benefit plan be in  writing?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. No. Section 132(f) does not require that a qualified  transportation fringe benefit plan be in writing.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. Is there a limit on the value of qualified transportation  fringes that may be excluded from an employee's gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A-7. (a) Transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit  passes. Before January 1, 2002, up to $65 per month is excludable from  the gross income of an employee for transportation in a commuter highway  vehicle and transit passes provided by an employer. On January 1, 2002,  this amount is increased to $100 per month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Parking. Up to $175 per month is excludable from the gross  income of an employee for qualified parking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combination. An employer may provide qualified parking benefits  in addition to transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and transit  passes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cost-of-living adjustments. The amounts in paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this Q/A-7 are adjusted annually, beginning with 2000, to reflect  cost-of-living. The adjusted figures are announced by the Service before  the beginning of the year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. What amount is includible in an employee's wages for income and  employment tax purposes if the value of the qualified transportation  fringe exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. (a) Generally, an employee must include in gross income the  amount by   which the fair market value of the benefit exceeds the sum of the  amount, if any, paid by the employee and any amount excluded from gross  income under section 132(a)(5). Thus, assuming no other statutory  exclusion applies, if an employer provides an employee with a qualified  transportation fringe that exceeds the applicable statutory monthly  limit and the employee does not make any payment, the value of the  benefits provided in excess of the applicable statutory monthly limit is  included in the employee's wages for income and employment tax purposes.  See Sec. 1.61-21(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following examples illustrate the principles of this Q/A-8:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each month in a year in which the statutory  monthly transit pass limit is $100 (i.e., a year after 2001), Employer M  provides a transit pass valued at $110 to Employee D, who does not pay  any amount to Employer M for the transit pass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 1, because the value of the monthly transit  pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $10, $120 ($110--$100, times  12 months) must be included in D's wages for income and employment tax  purposes for the year with respect to the transit passes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each month in a year in which the statutory  monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer M provides qualified  parking valued at $195 to Employee E, who does not pay any amount to M  for the parking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 2, because the fair market value of the  qualified parking exceeds the statutory monthly limit by $20, $240  ($195--$175, times 12 months) must be included in Employee E's wages for  income and employment tax purposes for the year with respect to the  qualified parking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each month in a year in which the statutory  monthly qualified parking limit is $175, Employer P provides qualified  parking with a fair market value of $220 per month to its employees, but  charges each employee $45 per month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 3, because the sum of the amount paid by an  employee ($45) plus the amount excludable for qualified parking ($175)  is not less than the fair market value of the monthly benefit, no amount  is includible in the employee's wages for income and employment tax  purposes with respect to the qualified parking.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9. Are excludable qualified transportation fringes calculated on a  monthly basis?</p><p class="depth0">A-9. (a) In general. Yes. The value of transportation in a commuter  highway vehicle, transit passes, and qualified parking is calculated on  a monthly basis to determine whether the value of the benefit has  exceeded the applicable statutory monthly limit on qualified  transportation fringes. Except in the case of a transit pass provided to  an employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to qualified  transportation fringes used by the employee in a month. Monthly  exclusion amounts are not combined to provide a qualified transportation  fringe for any month exceeding the statutory limit. A month is a  calendar month or a substantially equivalent period applied  consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transit passes. In the case of transit passes provided to an  employee, the applicable statutory monthly limit applies to the transit  passes provided by the employer to the employee in a month for that  month or for any previous month in the calendar year. In addition,  transit passes distributed in advance for more than one month, but not  for more than twelve months, are qualified transportation fringes if the  requirements in paragraph (c) of this Q/A-9 are met (relating to the  income tax and employment tax treatment of advance transit passes). The  applicable statutory monthly limit under section 132(f)(2) on the  combined amount of transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and  transit passes may be calculated by taking into account the monthly  limits for all months for which the transit passes are distributed. In  the case of a pass that is valid for more than one month, such as an  annual pass, the value of the pass may be divided by the number of  months for which it is valid for purposes of determining whether the  value of the pass exceeds the statutory monthly limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rule if employee's employment terminates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income tax  treatment. The value of transit passes provided in advance to an  employee with respect to a month in which the individual is not an  employee is included in the employee's wages for income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reporting and employment tax treatment. Transit passes  distributed in advance to an employee are excludable from wages for  employment tax purposes under sections 3121, 3306, and 3401   (FICA, FUTA, and income tax withholding) if the employer distributes  transit passes to the employee in advance for not more than three months  and, at the time the transit passes are distributed, there is not an  established date that the employee's employment will terminate (for  example, if the employee has given notice of retirement) which will  occur before the beginning of the last month of the period for which the  transit passes are provided. If the employer distributes transit passes  to an employee in advance for not more than three months and at the time  the transit passes are distributed there is an established date that the  employee's employment will terminate, and the employee's employment does  terminate before the beginning of the last month of the period for which  the transit passes are provided, the value of transit passes provided  for months beginning after the date of termination during which the  employee is not employed by the employer is included in the employee's  wages for employment tax purposes. If transit passes are distributed in  advance for more than three months, the value of transit passes provided  for the months during which the employee is not employed by the employer  is includible in the employee's wages for employment tax purposes  regardless of whether at the time the transit passes were distributed  there was an established date of termination of the employee's  employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this Q/A-9:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee E incurs $150 for qualified parking used  during the month of June of a year in which the statutory monthly  parking limit is $175, for which E is reimbursed $150 by Employer R.  Employee E incurs $180 in expenses for qualified parking used during the  month of July of that year, for which E is reimbursed $180 by Employer  R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 1, because monthly exclusion amounts may not be  combined to provide a benefit in any month greater than the applicable  statutory limit, the amount by which the amount reimbursed for July  exceeds the applicable statutory monthly limit ($180 minus $175 equals  $5) is includible in Employee E's wages for income and employment tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee F receives transit passes from Employer G  with a value of $195 in March of a year (for which the statutory monthly  transit pass limit is $65) for January, February, and March of that  year. F was hired during January and has not received any transit passes  from G.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 2, the value of the transit passes (three  months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from F's wages for income  and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer S has a qualified transportation fringe  benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes near the  beginning of each calendar quarter for that calendar quarter. All  employees of Employer S receive transit passes from Employer S with a  value of $195 on March 31 for the second calendar quarter covering the  months April, May, and June (of a year in which the statutory monthly  transit pass limit is $65).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 3, because the value of the transit passes may  be calculated by taking into account the monthly limits for all months  for which the transit passes are distributed, the value of the transit  passes (three months times $65 equals $195) is excludable from the  employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee T,  an employee of Employer S, terminates employment with S on May 31. There  was not an established date of termination for Employee T at the time  the transit passes were distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 4, because at the time the transit passes were  distributed there was not an established date of termination for  Employee T, the value of the transit passes provided for June ($65) is  excludable from T's wages for employment tax purposes. However, the  value of the transit passes distributed to Employee T for June ($65) is  not excludable from T's wages for income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If Employee T's May 31 termination date was established at the  time the transit passes were provided, the value of the transit passes  provided for June ($65) is included in T's wages for both income and  employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer F has a qualified transportation fringe  benefit plan under which its employees receive transit passes semi- annually in advance of the months for which the transit passes are  provided. All employees of Employer F, including Employee X, receive  transit passes from F with a value of $390 on June 30 for the 6 months  of July through December (of a year in which the statutory monthly  transit pass limit is $65). Employee X's employment terminates and his  last day of work is August 1. Employer F's other employees remain  employed throughout the remainder of the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 5, the value of the transit passes provided to  Employee X for the months September, October, November, and   December ($65 times 4 months equals $260) of the year is included in X's  wages for income and employment tax purposes. The value of the transit  passes provided to Employer F's other employees is excludable from the  employees' wages for income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each month during a year in which the statutory  monthly transit pass limit is $65, Employer R distributes transit passes  with a face amount of $70 to each of its employees. Transit passes with  a face amount of $70 can be purchased from the transit system by any  individual for $65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 6, because the value of the transit passes  distributed by Employer R does not exceed the applicable statutory  monthly limit ($65), no portion of the value of the transit passes is  included as wages for income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10. May an employee receive qualified transportation fringes from  more than one employer?</p><p class="depth0">A-10. (a) General rule. Yes. The statutory monthly limits described  in Q/A-7 of this section apply to benefits provided by an employer to  its employees. For this purpose, all employees treated as employed by a  single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as  employed by a single employer. See section 414(t) and Sec. 1.132-1(c).  Thus, qualified transportation fringes paid by entities under common  control under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) are combined for purposes  of applying the applicable statutory monthly limit. In addition, an  individual who is treated as a leased employee of the employer under  section 414(n) is treated as an employee of that employer for purposes  of section 132. See section 414(n)(3)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this Q/A-10:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During a year in which the statutory monthly  qualified parking limit is $175, Employee E works for Employers M and N,  who are unrelated and not treated as a single employer under section  414(b), (c), (m), or (o). Each month, M and N each provide qualified  parking benefits to E with a value of $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 1, because M and N are unrelated employers, and  the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by each is not more  than the applicable statutory monthly limit, the parking benefits  provided by each employer are excludable as qualified transportation  fringes assuming that the other requirements of this section are  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as in Example 1, except that Employers M  and N are treated as a single employer under section 414(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 2, because M and N are treated as a single  employer, the value of the monthly parking benefit provided by M and N  must be combined for purposes of determining whether the applicable  statutory monthly limit has been exceeded. Thus, the amount by which the  value of the parking benefit exceeds the monthly limit ($200 minus the  monthly limit amount of $175 equals $25) for each month in the year is  includible in E's wages for income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to employees  pursuant to a compensation reduction agreement?</p><p class="depth0">A-11. Yes. An employer may offer employees a choice between cash  compensation and any qualified transportation fringe. An employee who is  offered this choice and who elects qualified transportation fringes is  not required to include the cash compensation in income if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The election is pursuant to an arrangement described in Q/A-12  of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the reduction in cash compensation does not exceed  the limitation in Q/A-13 of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The arrangement satisfies the timing and reimbursement rules in  Q/A-14 and 16 of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The related fringe benefit arrangement otherwise satisfies the  requirements set forth elsewhere in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12. What is a compensation reduction election for purposes of  section 132(f)?</p><p class="depth0">A-12. (a) Election requirements generally. A compensation reduction  arrangement is an arrangement under which the employer provides the  employee with the right to elect whether the employee will receive  either a fixed amount of cash compensation at a specified future date or  a fixed amount of qualified transportation fringes to be provided for a  specified future period (such as qualified parking to be used during a  future calendar month). The employee's election must be in writing or  another form, such as electronic, that includes, in a permanent and  verifiable form, the information   required to be in the election. The election must contain the date of  the election, the amount of the compensation to be reduced, and the  period for which the benefit will be provided. The election must relate  to a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage of compensation reduction.  An election to reduce compensation for a period by a set amount for such  period may be automatically renewed for subsequent periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Automatic election permitted. An employer may provide under its  qualified transportation fringe benefit plan that a compensation  reduction election will be deemed to have been made if the employee does  not elect to receive cash compensation in lieu of the qualified  transportation fringe, provided that the employee receives adequate  notice that a compensation reduction will be made and is given adequate  opportunity to choose to receive the cash compensation instead of the  qualified transportation fringe. See Sec. 1.401(a)-21 of this chapter  for rules permitting the use of electronic media to make participant  elections with respect to employee benefit arrangements.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13. Is there a limit to the amount of the compensation reduction?</p><p class="depth0">A-13. Yes. Each month, the amount of the compensation reduction may  not exceed the combined applicable statutory monthly limits for  transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, and  qualified parking. For example, for a year in which the statutory  monthly limit is $65 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle  and transit passes, and $175 for qualified parking, an employee could  elect to reduce compensation for any month by no more than $240 ($65  plus $175) with respect to qualified transportation fringes. If an  employee were to elect to reduce compensation by $250 for a month, the  excess $10 ($250 minus $240) would be includible in the employee's wages  for income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14. When must the employee have made a compensation reduction  election and under what circumstances may the amount be paid in cash to  the employee?</p><p class="depth0">A-14. (a) The compensation reduction election must satisfy the  requirements set forth under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q/A- 14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Timing of election. The compensation reduction election must be  made before the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other  taxable amount at the employee's discretion. The determination of  whether the employee is able currently to receive the cash does not  depend on whether it has been constructively received for purposes of  section 451. The election must specify that the period (such as a  calendar month) for which the qualified transportation fringe will be  provided must not begin before the election is made. Thus, a  compensation reduction election must relate to qualified transportation  fringes to be provided after the election. For this purpose, the date a  qualified transportation fringe is provided is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date the employee receives a voucher or similar item; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In any other case, the date the employee uses the qualified  transportation fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Revocability of elections. The employee may not revoke a  compensation reduction election after the employee is able currently to  receive the cash or other taxable amount at the employee's discretion.  In addition, the election may not be revoked after the beginning of the  period for which the qualified transportation fringe will be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compensation reduction amounts not refundable. Unless an  election is revoked in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of this Q/ A-14, an employee may not subsequently receive the compensation (in cash  or any form other than by payment of a qualified transportation fringe  under the employer's plan). Thus, an employer's qualified transportation  fringe benefit plan may not provide that an employee who ceases to  participate in the employer's qualified transportation fringe benefit  plan (such as in the case of termination of employment) is entitled to  receive a refund of the amount by which the employee's compensation  reductions exceed the actual qualified transportation fringes provided  to the employee by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this Q/A-14:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer P maintains a qualified transportation  fringe benefit arrangement during a year in which the statutory monthly  limit is $100 for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and  transit passes (2002 or later) and $180 for qualified parking. Employees  of P are paid cash compensation twice per month, with the payroll dates  being the first and the fifteenth day of the month. Under P's  arrangement, an employee is permitted to elect at any time before the  first day of a month to reduce his or her compensation payable during  that month in an amount up to the applicable statutory monthly limit  ($100 if the employee elects coverage for transportation in a commuter  highway vehicle or a mass transit pass, or $180 if the employee chooses  qualified parking) in return for the right to receive qualified  transportation fringes up to the amount of the election. If such an  election is made, P will provide a mass transit pass for that month with  a value not exceeding the compensation reduction amount elected by the  employee or will reimburse the cost of other qualified transportation  fringes used by the employee on or after the first day of that month up  to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee. Any  compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for the month that  is not used for qualified transportation fringes is not refunded to the  employee at any future date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 1, the arrangement satisfies the requirements  of this Q/A-14 because the election is made before the employee is able  currently to receive the cash and the election specifies the future  period for which the qualified transportation fringes will be provided.  The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/A-14 and  Q/A-13 of this section if employees are allowed to elect to reduce  compensation up to $280 per month ($100 plus $180).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The arrangement would also satisfy the requirements of this Q/ A-14 (and Q/A-13 of this section) if employees are allowed to make an  election at any time before the first or the fifteenth day of the month  to reduce their compensation payable on that payroll date by an amount  not in excess of one-half of the applicable statutory monthly limit  (depending on the type of qualified transportation fringe elected by the  employee) and P provides a mass transit pass on or after the applicable  payroll date for the compensation reduction amount elected by the  employee for the payroll date or reimburses the cost of other qualified  transportation fringes used by the employee on or after the payroll date  up to the compensation reduction amount elected by the employee for that  payroll date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee Q elects to reduce his compensation payable  on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly mass transit limit  is $65) by $195 in exchange for a mass transit voucher to be provided in  March. The election is made on the preceding February 27. Employee Q was  hired in January of the year. On March 10 of the year, the employer of  Employee Q delivers to Employee Q a mass transit voucher worth $195 for  the months of January, February, and March.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 2, $65 is included in Employee Q's wages for  income and employment tax purposes because the compensation reduction  election fails to satisfy the requirement in this Q/A-14 and Q/A-12 of  this section that the period for which the qualified transportation  fringe will be provided not begin before the election is made to the  extent the election relates to $65 worth of transit passes for January  of the year. The $65 for February is not taxable because the election  was for a future period that includes at least one day in February.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> However, no amount would be included in Employee Q's wages as  a result of the election if $195 worth of mass transit passes were  instead provided to Q for the months of February, March, and April  (because the compensation reduction would relate solely to fringes to be  provided for a period not beginning before the date of the election and  the amount provided does not exceed the aggregate limit for the period,  i.e., the sum of $65 for each of February, March, and April). See Q/A-9  of this section for rules governing transit passes distributed in  advance for more than one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee R elects to reduce his compensation payable  on March 1 of a year (for which the statutory monthly parking limit is  $175) by $185 in exchange for reimbursement by Employer T of parking  expenses incurred by Employee R for parking on or near Employer T's  business premises during the period beginning after the date of the  election through March. The election is made on the preceding February  27. Employee R incurs $10 in parking expenses on February 28 of the  year, and $175 in parking expenses during the month of March. On April 5  of the year, Employer T reimburses Employee R $185 for the parking  expenses incurred on February 28, and during March, of the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example 3, no amount would be includible in Employee  R's wages for income and employment tax purposes because the  compensation reduction related solely to parking on or near Employer R's  business premises used during a period not beginning before the date of  the election and the amount reimbursed for parking used in any one month  does not exceed the statutory monthly limitation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15. May an employee whose qualified transportation fringe costs  are less   than the employee's compensation reduction carry over this excess amount  to subsequent periods?</p><p class="depth0">A-15. (a) Yes. An employee may carry over unused compensation  reduction amounts to subsequent periods under the plan of the employee's  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following example illustrates the principles of this Q/A-15:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By an election made before November 1 of a year for  which the statutory monthly mass transit limit is $65, Employee E elects  to reduce compensation in the amount of $65 for the month of November. E  incurs $50 in employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses during  November for which E is reimbursed $50 by Employer R, E's employer. By  an election made before December, E elects to reduce compensation by $65  for the month of December. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter  highway vehicle expenses during December for which E is reimbursed $65  by R. Before the following January, E elects to reduce compensation by  $50 for the month of January. E incurs $65 in employee-operated commuter  highway vehicle expenses during January for which E is reimbursed $65 by  R because R allows E to carry over to the next year the $15 amount by  which the compensation reductions for November and December exceeded the  employee-operated commuter highway vehicle expenses incurred during  those months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example, because Employee E is reimbursed in an amount  not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly limit, and the  reimbursement does not exceed the amount of employee-operated commuter  highway vehicle expenses incurred during the month of January, the  amount reimbursed ($65) is excludable from E's wages for income and  employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16. How does section 132(f) apply to expense reimbursements?</p><p class="depth0">A-16. (a) In general. The term qualified transportation fringe  includes cash reimbursement by an employer to an employee for expenses  incurred or paid by an employee for transportation in a commuter highway  vehicle or qualified parking. The term qualified transportation fringe  also includes cash reimbursement for transit passes made under a bona  fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in accordance with section  132(f)(3), only if permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16. The  reimbursement must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement  which meets the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q/A-16. A payment made  before the date an expense has been incurred or paid is not a  reimbursement. In addition, a bona fide reimbursement arrangement does  not include an arrangement that is dependent solely upon an employee  certifying in advance that the employee will incur expenses at some  future date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule for transit passes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term  qualified transportation fringe includes cash reimbursement for transit  passes made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement, but, in  accordance with section 132(f)(3), only if no voucher or similar item  that may be exchanged only for a transit pass is readily available for  direct distribution by the employer to employees. If a voucher is  readily available, the requirement that a voucher be distributed in-kind  by the employer is satisfied if the voucher is distributed by the  employer or by another person on behalf of the employer (for example, if  a transit operator credits amounts to the employee's fare card as a  result of payments made to the operator by the employer).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Voucher or similar item. For purposes of the special rule in  paragraph (b) of this Q/A-16, a transit system voucher is an instrument  that may be purchased by employers from a voucher provider that is  accepted by one or more mass transit operators (e.g., train, subway, and  bus) in an area as fare media or in exchange for fare media. Thus, for  example, a transit pass that may be purchased by employers directly from  a voucher provider is a transit system voucher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Voucher provider. The term voucher provider means any person in  the trade or business of selling transit system vouchers to employers,  or any transit system or transit operator that sells vouchers to  employers for the purpose of direct distribution to employees. Thus, a  transit operator might or might not be a voucher provider. A voucher  provider is not, for example, a third-party employee benefits  administrator that administers a transit pass benefit program for an  employer using vouchers that the employer could obtain directly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Readily available. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a voucher  or similar   item is readily available for direct distribution by the employer to  employees if and only if an employer can obtain it from a voucher  provider that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> does not impose fare media charges that cause vouchers to not be  readily available as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> does not impose other restrictions that cause vouchers to not  be readily available as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>, and therefore cause vouchers to not be readily  available, if and only if the average annual fare media charges that the  employer reasonably expects to incur for transit system vouchers  purchased from the voucher provider (disregarding reasonable and  customary delivery charges imposed by the voucher provider, e.g., not in  excess of $15) are more than 1 percent of the average annual value of  the vouchers for a transit system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other restrictions. For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this  section, restrictions that cause vouchers to not be readily available  are restrictions imposed by the voucher provider other than fare media  charges that effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers  appropriate for distribution to employees. Examples of such restrictions  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advance purchase requirements. Advance purchase requirements  cause vouchers to not be readily available only if the voucher provider  does not offer vouchers at regular intervals or fails to provide the  voucher within a reasonable period after receiving payment for the  voucher. For example, a requirement that vouchers may be purchased only  once per year may effectively prevent an employer from obtaining  vouchers for distribution to employees. An advance purchase requirement  that vouchers be purchased not more frequently than monthly does not  effectively prevent the employer from obtaining vouchers for  distribution to employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Purchase quantity requirements. Purchase quantity requirements  cause vouchers to not be readily available if the voucher provider does  not offer vouchers in quantities that are reasonably appropriate to the  number of the employer's employees who use mass transportation (for  example, the voucher provider requires a $1,000 minimum purchase and the  employer seeks to purchase only $200 of vouchers).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitations on denominations of vouchers that are available.  If the voucher provider does not offer vouchers in denominations  appropriate for distribution to the employer's employees, vouchers are  not readily available. For example, vouchers provided in $5 increments  up to the monthly limit are appropriate for distribution to employees,  while vouchers available only in a denomination equal to the monthly  limit are not appropriate for distribution to employees if the amount of  the benefit provided to the employer's employees each month is normally  less than the monthly limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Company C in City X sells mass transit vouchers to  employers in the metropolitan area of X in various denominations  appropriate for distribution to employees. Employers can purchase  vouchers monthly in reasonably appropriate quantities. Several different  bus, rail, van pool, and ferry operators service X, and a number   of the operators accept the vouchers either as fare media or in exchange  for fare media. To cover its operating expenses, C imposes on each  voucher a 50 cents charge, plus a reasonable and customary $15 charge  for delivery of each order of vouchers. Employer M disburses vouchers  purchased from C to its employees who use operators that accept the  vouchers and M reasonably expects that $55 is the average value of the  voucher it will purchase from C for the next calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example, vouchers for X are readily available for  direct distribution by the employer to employees because the expected  cost of the vouchers disbursed to M's employees for the next calendar  year is not more than 1 percent of the value of the vouchers (50 cents  divided by $55 equals 0.91 percent), the delivery charges are  disregarded because they are reasonable and customary, and there are no  other restrictions that cause the vouchers to not be readily available.  Thus, any reimbursement of mass transportation costs in X would not be a  qualified transportation fringe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Substantiation requirements. Employers that make cash  reimbursements must establish a bona fide reimbursement arrangement to  establish that their employees have, in fact, incurred expenses for  transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, or  qualified parking. For purposes of section 132(f), whether cash  reimbursements are made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement may  vary depending on the facts and circumstances, including the method or  methods of payment utilized within the mass transit system. The employer  must implement reasonable procedures to ensure that an amount equal to  the reimbursement was incurred for transportation in a commuter highway  vehicle, transit passes, or qualified parking. The expense must be  substantiated within a reasonable period of time. An expense  substantiated to the payor within 180 days after it has been paid will  be treated as having been substantiated within a reasonable period of  time. An employee certification at the time of reimbursement in either  written or electronic form may be a reasonable reimbursement procedure  depending on the facts and circumstances. Examples of reasonable  reimbursement procedures are set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q/A-16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An employee presents to the employer a parking expense receipt  for parking on or near the employer's business premises, the employee  certifies that the parking was used by the employee, and the employer  has no reason to doubt the employee's certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An employee either submits a used time-sensitive transit pass  (such as a monthly pass) to the employer and certifies that he or she  purchased it or presents an unused or used transit pass to the employer  and certifies that he or she purchased it and the employee certifies  that he or she has not previously been reimbursed for the transit pass.  In both cases, the employer has no reason to doubt the employee's  certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a receipt is not provided in the ordinary course of business  (e.g., if the employee uses metered parking or if used transit passes  cannot be returned to the user), the employee certifies to the employer  the type and the amount of expenses incurred, and the employer has no  reason to doubt the employee's certification.</p><p class="depth0">Q-17. May an employer provide nontaxable cash reimbursement under  section 132(f) for periods longer than one month?</p><p class="depth0">A-17. (a) General rule. Yes. Qualified transportation fringes  include reimbursement to employees for costs incurred for transportation  in more than one month, provided the reimbursement for each month in the  period is calculated separately and does not exceed the applicable  statutory monthly limit for any month in the period. See Q/A-8 and 9 of  this section if the limit for a month is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this Q/A-17:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee R pays $100 per month for qualified parking  used during the period from April 1 through June 30 of a year in which  the statutory monthly qualified parking limit is $175. After receiving  adequate substantiation from Employee R, R's employer reimburses R $300  in cash on June 30 of that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this Example, because the value of the reimbursed expenses  for each month did   not exceed the applicable statutory monthly limit, the $300  reimbursement is excludable from R's wages for income and employment tax  purposes as a qualified transportation fringe.</p><p class="depth0">Q-18. What are the substantiation requirements if an employer  distributes transit passes?</p><p class="depth0">A-18. There are no substantiation requirements if the employer  distributes transit passes. Thus, an employer may distribute a transit  pass for each month with a value not more than the statutory monthly  limit without requiring any certification from the employee regarding  the use of the transit pass.</p><p class="depth0">Q-19. May an employer choose to impose substantiation requirements  in addition to those described in this regulation?</p><p class="depth0">A-19. Yes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-20. How is the value of parking determined?</p><p class="depth0">A-20. Section 1.61-21(b)(2) applies for purposes of determining the  value of parking.</p><p class="depth0">Q-21. How do the qualified transportation fringe rules apply to van  pools?</p><p class="depth0">A-21. (a) Van pools generally. Employer and employee-operated van  pools, as well as private or public transit-operated van pools, may  qualify as qualified transportation fringes. The value of van pool  benefits which are qualified transportation fringes may be excluded up  to the applicable statutory monthly limit for transportation in a  commuter highway vehicle and transit passes, less the value of any  transit passes provided by the employer for the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employer-operated van pools. The value of van pool  transportation provided by or for an employer to its employees is  excludable as a qualified transportation fringe, provided the van  qualifies as a commuter highway vehicle as defined in section  132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of this section. A van pool is operated by or for  the employer if the employer purchases or leases vans to enable  employees to commute together or the employer contracts with and pays a  third party to provide the vans and some or all of the costs of  operating the vans, including maintenance, liability insurance and other  operating expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employee-operated van pools. Cash reimbursement by an employer  to employees for expenses incurred for transportation in a van pool  operated by employees independent of their employer are excludable as  qualified transportation fringes, provided that the van qualifies as a  commuter highway vehicle as defined in section 132(f)(5)(B) and Q/A-2 of  this section. See Q/A-16 of this section for the rules governing cash  reimbursements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Private or public transit-operated van pool transit passes. The  qualified transportation fringe exclusion for transit passes is  available for travel in van pools owned and operated either by public  transit authorities or by any person in the business of transporting  persons for compensation or hire. In accordance with paragraph (b) of Q/ A-3 of this section, the van must seat at least 6 adults (excluding the  driver). See Q/A-16(b) and (c) of this section for a special rule for  cash reimbursement for transit passes and the substantiation  requirements for cash reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>, or the commuting valuation rule in  Sec. 1.61-21(f). If one of these special valuation rules is used, the  employer must use the same valuation rule to value the use of the  commuter highway vehicle by each employee who share the use. See Sec.  1.61-21(c)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Qualified parking prime member. If an employee obtains a  qualified parking space as a result of membership in a car or van pool,  the applicable statutory monthly limit for qualified parking applies to  the individual to whom the parking space is assigned. This individual is  the prime member. In determining the tax consequences to the prime  member, the statutory monthly limit amounts of each car pool member may  not be combined. If the employer provides access to the space and the   space is not assigned to a particular individual, then the employer must  designate one of its employees as the prime member who will bear the tax  consequences. The employer may not designate more than one prime member  for a car or van pool during a month. The employer of the prime member  is responsible for including the value of the qualified parking in  excess of the statutory monthly limit in the prime member's wages for  income and employment tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q-22. What are the reporting and employment tax requirements for  qualified transportation fringes?</p><p class="depth0">A-22. (a) Employment tax treatment generally. Qualified  transportation fringes not exceeding the applicable statutory monthly  limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are not wages for purposes of  the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment  Tax Act (FUTA), and federal income tax withholding. Any amount by which  an employee elects to reduce compensation as provided in Q/A-11 of this  section is not subject to the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax  withholding. Qualified transportation fringes exceeding the applicable  statutory monthly limit described in Q/A-7 of this section are wages for  purposes of the FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding and  are reported on the employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this chapter. Employers  must report and deposit the amounts withheld in addition to reporting  and depositing other employment taxes. See Q/A-16 of this section for  rules governing cash reimbursements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Noncash fringe benefits exceeding monthly limits. If the value  of noncash qualified transportation fringes exceeds the applicable  statutory monthly limit, the employer may elect, for purposes of the  FICA, the FUTA, and federal income tax withholding, to treat the noncash  taxable fringe benefits as paid on a pay period, quarterly, semi-annual,  annual, or other basis, provided that the benefits are treated as paid  no less frequently than annually.</p><p class="depth0">Q-23. How does section 132(f) interact with other fringe benefit  rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-23. For purposes of section 132, the terms working condition  fringe and de minimis fringe do not include any qualified transportation  fringe under section 132(f). If, however, an employer provides local  transportation other than transit passes (without any direct or indirect  compensation reduction election), the value of the benefit may be  excludable, either totally or partially, under fringe benefit rules  other than the qualified transportation fringe rules under section  132(f). See Sec. Sec. 1.132-6(d)(2)(i) (occasional local transportation  fare), 1.132-6(d)(2)(iii) (transportation provided under unusual  circumstances), and 1.61-21(k) (valuation of local transportation  provided to qualified employees). See also Q/A-4(b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-24. May qualified transportation fringes be provided to  individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders of S-corporations,  or independent contractors?</p><p class="depth0">A-24. (a) General rule. Section 132(f)(5)(E) states that self- employed individuals who are employees within the meaning of section  401(c)(1) are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). Therefore,  individuals who are partners, sole proprietors, or other independent  contractors are not employees for purposes of section 132(f). In  addition, under section 1372(a), 2-percent shareholders of S  corporations are treated as partners for fringe benefit purposes. Thus,  an individual who is both a 2-percent shareholder of an S corporation  and a common law employee of that S corporation is not considered an  employee for purposes of section 132(f). However, while section 132(f)  does not apply to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders  of S corporations, or independent contractors, other exclusions for  working condition and de minimis fringes may be available as described  in paragraphs   (b) and (c) of this Q/A-24. See Sec. Sec. 1.132-1(b)(2) and 1.132- 1(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transit passes. The working condition and de minimis fringe  exclusions under section 132(a)(3) and (4) are available for transit  passes provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders,  and independent contractors. For example, tokens or farecards provided  by a partnership to an individual who is a partner that enable the  partner to commute on a public transit system (not including privately- operated van pools) are excludable from the partner's gross income if  the value of the tokens and farecards in any month does not exceed the  dollar amount specified in Sec. 1.132-6(d)(1). However, if the value of  a pass provided in a month exceeds the dollar amount specified in Sec.  1.132-6(d)(1), the full value of the benefit provided (not merely the  amount in excess of the dollar amount specified in Sec. 1.132-6(d)(1))  is includible in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Parking. The working condition fringe rules under section 132(d)  do not apply to commuter parking. See Sec. 1.132-5(a)(1). However, the  de minimis fringe rules under section 132(e) are available for parking  provided to individuals who are partners, 2-percent shareholders, or  independent contractors that qualifies under the de minimis rules. See  Sec. 1.132-6(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this Q/A-24:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual G is a partner in partnership P.

[T.D. 8933, 66 FR 2244, Jan. 11, 2001; 66 FR 18190, Apr. 6, 2001, as  amended by T.D. 9294, 71 FR 61883, Oct. 20, 2006]    Sec. 1.133-1T  Questions and answers relating to interest on certain  loans used to acquire employer securities (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What does section 133 provide?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: In general, section 133 provides that certain commercial  lenders may exclude from gross income fifty percent of the interest  received with respect to securities acquisition loans. A securities  acquisition loan is any loan to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)  (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) that qualifies as an exempt loan  under Sec. Sec. 54.4975-7 and -11 to the extent that the proceeds are  used to acquire employer securities (within the meaning of section  409(l)) for the ESOP. A loan made to a corporation sponsoring an ESOP  (or to a person related to such corporation under section 133(b)(2)) may  also qualify as a securities acquisition loan to the extent and for the  period that the proceeds are (a) loaned to the corporation's ESOP under  a loan that qualifies as an exempt loan under Sec. Sec. 54.4975-7 and - 11 and that has substantially similar terms as the loan from the  commercial lender to the sponsoring corporation, and (b) used to acquire  employer securities for the ESOP. The terms of the loan between the  commercial lender and the sponsoring corporation (or a related  corporation) and the loan between such corporation and the ESOP shall be  treated as substantially similar only if the timing and rate at which  employer securities would be released from encumbrance if the loan from  the commercial lender were the exempt loan under the applicable rule of  Sec. 54.4975-7(b)(8) are substantially similar to the timing and rate  at which employer securities will actually be released from encumbrance  in accordance with such rule. For this purpose, if the loan from the  commercial lender to the sponsoring corporation states a variable rate  of interest and the loan between   the corporation and the ESOP states a fixed rate of interest, whether  the terms of the loans are substantially similar shall be determined at  the time the obligations are initially issued by taking into account the  adjustment interval on the variable rate loan and the maturity of the  fixed rate loan. For example, if the rate on the loan from the  commercial lender to the sponsoring corporation adjusts each six months  and the loan from the corporation to the ESOP has a ten year term, the  initial interest rate on the variable rate loan could be compared to the  rate on the fixed rate loan by comparing the yields on 6 month and ten  year Treasury obligations. Similarly, if the rates on the two loans are  based on different compounding assumptions, whether the terms of the  loans are substantially similar shall be determined by taking into  account the different compounding assumptions. A securities acquisition  loan may be evidenced by any note, bond, debenture, or certificate.  Also, section 133(b)(2) provides that certain loans between related  persons are not securities acquisition loans. In addition, a loan from a  commercial lender to an ESOP or sponsoring corporation to purchase  employer securities will not be treated as a securities acquisition loan  to the extent that such loan is used, either directly or indirectly, to  purchase employer securities from any other qualified plan, including  any other ESOP, maintained by the employer or any other corporation  which is a member of the same controlled group (as defined in section  409(l)(4)).</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What lenders are eligible to receive the fifty percent interest  exclusion?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: Under section 133(a), a bank (within the meaning of section  581), an insurance company to which subchapter L applies, or a  corporation (other than a subchapter S corporation) actively engaged in  the business of lending money may exclude from gross income fifty  percent of the interest received with respect to a securities  acquisition loan (as defined in Q&A-1; of Sec. 1.133-1T). For purposes  of section 133(a)(3), a corporation is actively engaged in the business  of lending money if it lends money to the public on a regular and  continuing basis (other than in connection with the purchase by the  public of goods and services from the lender or a related party). A  corporation is not actively engaged in the business of lending money if  a predominant share of the original value of the loans it makes to  unrelated parties (other than in connection with the purchase by the  public of goods and services from the lender or a related party) are  securities acquisition loans.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: May loans which qualify for the fifty percent interest  exclusion under section 133 be syndicated to other lending institutions?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: Securities acquisition loans under section 133 may be  syndicated to other lending institutions provided that such lending  institutions are described in section 133(a) (1), (2) or (3) and the  loan was originated by a qualified holder. Subsequent holders of the  debt instrument may qualify for the partial interest exclusion of  section 133 if such holders satisfy the requirements of section 133 and  such loan does not fail to be a securities acquisition loan under  section 133(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: When is section 133 effective?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Section 133 applies to securities acquisition loans made after  July 18, 1984, and used to acquire employer securities after July 18,  1984. The provision does not apply to loans made after July 18, 1984, to  the extent that such loans are renegotiations, directly or indirectly,  of loans outstanding on such date. A loan extended to an ESOP or  sponsoring corporation after July 18, 1984, will be treated as a  renegotiation of an outstanding loan if the loan proceeds are used to  refinance acquisitions of employer securities made prior to July 19,  1984. For example, if an ESOP borrowed money prior to July 19, 1984, to  purchase employer securities and after July 18, 1984, borrows other  funds from the same or a different commercial lender to repay the first  loan, the second loan will be treated as a renegotiation of an  outstanding loan to the extent of the repaid amount. Similarly, if,  after July 18, 1984, an ESOP sells employer securities, uses the  proceeds to retire a pre-July 19, 1984, loan and   obtains a second loan to acquire replacement employer securities, the  second loan will be treated as a renegotiation of an outstanding loan.
