                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Work experience means skills and abilities the claimant  has acquired through work he or she has done which show the type of work  he or she may be expected to do. Work the claimant has already been able  to do shows the kind of work that he or she may be expected to do. The  Board considers that the claimant's work experience is relevant and  applies when it was done within the last 15 years, lasted long enough  for him or her to learn to do it, and was substantial gainful activity.  This work experience is called ``past relevant work.'' The Board does  not usually consider that work the claimant did 15 years or more before  the time the Board is deciding whether he or she is disabled (or when  the disability insured status requirement was last met, if earlier)  applies. A gradual change occurs in most jobs so that after 15 years, it  is no longer realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in a  job done then continue to apply. The 15-year guide is intended to insure  that remote work experience is not currently applied. If the claimant  has no work experience or worked only ``off-and-on'' or for brief  periods of time during the 15-year period, the Board generally considers  that these do not apply. If the claimant has acquired skills through his  or her past work, the Board considers the claimant to have these work  skills unless he or she cannot use them in other skilled or semi-skilled  work that he or she can do. If the claimant cannot use his or her skills  in other skilled or semi-skilled work, the Board will consider his or  her work background the same as unskilled. However, even if the claimant  has no work experience, the Board may consider that the claimant is able  to do unskilled work because it requires little or no judgment and can  be learned in a short period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information about the claimant's work. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sometimes the Board  will need information about the claimant's past work to make a  disability determination. The Board may request work information from--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The claimant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The claimant's employer or other person who knows about the  claimant's work (member of family or co-worker) with the claimant's  permission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board will ask for the following information about all the  jobs the claimant has had in the last 15 years:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The dates the claimant worked.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All the duties the claimant did.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any tools, machinery, and equipment the claimant used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of walking, standing, sitting, lifting and carrying  the claimant did during the work day, as well as any other physical and  mental duties of the job.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If all the claimant's work in the past 15 years has been arduous  and unskilled, and the claimant has very little education, the Board  will ask the claimant to tell about all of his or her work from the time  he or she first began working.
