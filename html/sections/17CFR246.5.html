                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2">Revolving pool securitization means an issuing entity that is established to issue on multiple issuance dates more than one series, class, subclass, or tranche of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of securitized assets that will change in composition over time, and that does not monetize excess interest and fees from its securitized assets.</p><p class="depth2">Seller's interest means an ABS interest or ABS interests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collateralized by the securitized assets and servicing assets owned or held by the issuing entity, other than the following that are not considered a component of seller's interest:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Servicing assets that have been allocated as collateral only for a specific series in connection with administering the revolving pool securitization, such as a principal accumulation or interest reserve account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That is pari passu with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirement. A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of Sec. 246.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Measuring the seller's interest. In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to Sec. 246.4 are permitted to be invested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Measuring outstanding investor ABS interests. In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Holding and retention of the seller's interest; legacy trusts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding Sec. 246.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Offset for pool-level excess funding account. The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by

paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to Sec. 246.4 are permitted to be invested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Combined seller's interests and horizontal interest retention. The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this Sec. 246.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding Sec. 246.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Residual ABS interests in excess interest and fees. The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Offsetting eligible horizontal residual interest. The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would

meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in Sec. 246.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Specified dates. A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this Sec. 246.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dates are no more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors of disclosures required for the interest by paragraph (k) of this section, or for revolving pool securitizations that make distributions to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, no more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors of such disclosures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Disclosure and record maintenance. (1) Disclosure. A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption ``Credit Risk Retention'' the following disclosure in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (k):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure. A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption ``Credit Risk Retention'' the following disclosure in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (k):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security, a description of the material terms of the seller's interest, and the percentage of the seller's interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing of the securitization transaction, measured in accordance with the requirements of this Sec. 246.5, as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests issued, or as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, as required by the terms of the securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of seller's interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the material terms of any horizontal residual interests offsetting the seller's interest in accordance with paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disclosure of the fair value of those horizontal residual interests retained by the sponsor for the series being offered to investors and described in the disclosures, as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests issued, described in

the same manner and within the same timeframes required for disclosure of the fair values of eligible horizontal residual interests specified in Sec. 246.4(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjusted data. Disclosures required by this paragraph (k) to be made a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security of the amount of seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest may include adjustments to the amount of securitized assets for additions or removals the sponsor expects to make before the closing date and adjustments to the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for expected increases and decreases of those interests under the control of the sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Record maintenance. A sponsor must retain the disclosures required in paragraph (k)(1) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Early amortization of all outstanding series. A sponsor that organizes a revolving pool securitization that relies on this Sec. 246.5 to satisfy the risk retention requirements of Sec. 246.3, does not violate the requirements of this part if its seller's interest falls below the level required by Sec. 246. 5 after the revolving pool securitization commences early amortization, pursuant to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, of all series of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor was in full compliance with the requirements of this section on all measurement dates specified in paragraph (c) of this section prior to the commencement of early amortization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms of the seller's interest continue to make it pari passu with or subordinate in identical or varying amounts to each series of outstanding investor ABS interests issued with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms of any horizontal interest relied upon by the sponsor pursuant to paragraph (g) to offset the minimum seller's interest amount continue to require the interests to absorb losses in accordance with the terms of paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The revolving pool securitization issues no additional ABS interests after early amortization is initiated to any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, either at the time of issuance or during the amortization period.</p>
