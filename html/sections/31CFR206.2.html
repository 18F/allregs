For example, if an agency receives funds for deposit at 3 p.m. on Monday and transmits the deposits to the depositary by 2 p.m. on Tuesday (the depositary's next cutoff time), then next-day deposit requirements are met.</p><p class="depth0">Payment means a sum of money transferred to a recipient in satisfaction of an obligation.
