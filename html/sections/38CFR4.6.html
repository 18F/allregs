Every element in any way affecting the probative value to be assigned to the evidence in each individual claim must be thoroughly and conscientiously studied by each member of the rating board in the light of the established policies of the

Department of Veterans Affairs to the end that decisions will be equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law.</p>
