                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Section 133(b) (8) of title 23 of the United States Code authorizes the expenditure of surface transportation funds for transportation enhancement activities (TEA). Transportation enhancement activities which involve the acquisition, management, and disposition of real property, and the relocation of families, individuals, and businesses, are governed by the general requirements of the Federal-aid program found in titles 23 and 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. (1) Displacements for TEA are subject to the Uniform Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Displacements for TEA are subject to the Uniform Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions for TEA are subject to the Uniform Act except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Entities acquiring real property for TEA who lack the power of eminent domain may comply with the Uniform Act by meeting the limited requirements under 49 CFR 24.101(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements of the Uniform Act do not apply when real property acquired for a TEA was purchased from a third party by a qualified conservation organization, and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The conservation organization is not acting on behalf of the agency receiving TEA or other Federal-aid funds, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There was no Federal approval of property acquisition prior to the involvement of the conservation organization. [``Federal approval of property acquisition'' means the date of the approval of the environmental document or project authorization/agreement, whichever is earlier. ``Involvement of the conservation organization'' means

the date the organization makes a legally binding offer to acquire a real property interest, including an option to purchase, in the property.]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When a qualified conservation organization acquires real property for a project receiving Federal-aid highway funds on behalf of an agency with eminent domain authority, the requirements of the Uniform Act apply as if the agency had acquired the property itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When, subsequent to Federal approval of property acquisition, a qualified conservation organization acquires real property for a project receiving Federal-aid highway funds, and there will be no use or recourse to the power of eminent domain, the limited requirements of 49 CFR 24.101(a)(2) apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Property management. Real property acquired with TEA funds shall be managed in accordance with the property management requirements provided in subpart D of this part. Any use of the property for purposes other than that for which the TEA funds were provided must be consistent with the continuation of the original use. When the original use of the real property is converted by sale or lease to another use inconsistent with the original use, the STD shall assure that the fair market value or rent is charged and the proceeds reapplied to projects eligible under title 23 of the United States Code.</p>
