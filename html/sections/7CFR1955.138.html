In areas where  State law does not provide for full recovery of the cost of repairs  during the redemption period, a program sale is generally precluded  unless the property already meets program standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each purchaser will sign a statement acknowledging that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The property is subject to redemption rights according to State  law, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the property is redeemed, ownership and possession of the  property would revert to the previous owner and likely result in loss of  any additional investment in the property not recoverable under the  State's provisions of redemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The signed original statement will be filed in the purchaser's  County or District Office case file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If real estate brokers or auctioneers are engaged to sell the  property, the County Supervisor or District Director will inform them of  the redemption rights of the borrower and the conditions under which the  property may be sold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State Director, with prior approval of OGC, will issue a  State supplement incorporating the requirements of this section and  providing additional guidance appropriate for the State.
