Outdoor magazines are to be weather-resistant and theft-resistant. The ground around magazines must slope away for drainage or other adequate drainage be provided. When unattended, vehicular magazines must have wheels removed or otherwise be effectively immobilized by kingpin locking devices or other methods approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Construction. The doors are to be constructed of solid wood or metal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hinges and hasps. Hinges and hasps are to be attached to doors by welding, riveting, or bolting (nuts on inside of door). Hinges and hasps must be installed so that they cannot be removed when the doors are closed and locked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Locks. Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks; (ii) two padlocks fastened in separate hasps and staples; (iii) a combination of a mortise lock and a padlock; (iv) a mortise lock that requires two keys to open; or (v) a three-point lock. Padlocks must have at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least \3/8\ inch diameter. Padlocks must be protected with not less than \1/4\ inch steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the locks, hasps, and staples. Trailers, semitrailers, and similar vehicular magazines may, for each door, be locked with one steel padlock (which need not be protected by a steel hood) having at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least \3/8\ inch diameter, if the door hinges and lock hasp are securely fastened to the magazine and to the door frame. These requirements do not apply to magazine doors that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt, lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Placards. The placards required by Department of Transportation regulations at 49 CFR part 172, subpart F, for the transportation of blasting agents shall be displayed on all magazines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indoor magazines--(1) General. Indoor magazines are to be theft-resistant. They need not be weather-resistant if the buildings in which they are stored provide protection from the weather. No indoor magazine is to be located in a residence or dwelling. Indoor magazines containing quantities of blasting agents in excess of 50 pounds are subject to the requirements of Sec. 555.206 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.
