The Contractor shall tender for acceptance only those items that conform to the requirements of this contract.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Termination for the Government's convenience.
