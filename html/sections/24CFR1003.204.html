                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Eligible activities. The grantee may provide ICDBG funds as grants or loans to any CBDO qualified under this section to carry out a neighborhood revitalization, community economic development, or energy conservation project. The funded project activities may include those listed as eligible under this subpart, and, except as described in paragraph (b) of this section, activities not otherwise listed as eligible under this subpart. For purposes of qualifying as a project under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section, the funded activity or activities may be considered either alone or in concert with other project activities either being carried out or for which funding has been committed. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Neighborhood revitalization project includes activities of sufficient size and scope to have an impact on the decline of a geographic location within the jurisdiction of a grantee (but not the entire jurisdiction) designated in comprehensive plans, ordinances, or other local documents as a neighborhood, village, or similar geographical designation; or the entire jurisdiction of a grantee which is under 25,000 population;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Community economic development project includes activities that increase economic opportunity, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income, or that stimulate or retain businesses or permanent jobs, including projects that include one or more such activities that are clearly needed to address a lack of affordable housing accessible to existing or planned jobs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Energy conservation project includes activities that address energy conservation, principally for the benefit of the residents of the grantee's jurisdiction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To carry out a project means that the CBDO undertakes the funded activities directly or through contract with an entity other than the grantee, or through the provision of financial assistance for activities in which it retains a direct and controlling involvement and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ineligible activities. Notwithstanding that CBDOs may carry out activities that are not otherwise eligible under this subpart, this section does not authorize:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carrying out an activity described as ineligible in Sec. 1003.207(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carrying out public services that do not meet the requirements of Sec. 1003.201(e), except services carried out under this section that are specifically designed to increase economic opportunities through job training and placement and other employment support services, including, but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Carrying out an activity that would otherwise be eligible under Sec. 1003.205 or Sec. 1003.206, but that would result in the grantee's exceeding the spending limitation in Sec. 1003.206.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Eligible CBDOs. (1) A CBDO qualifying under this section is an organization which has the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is an association or corporation organized under State or local law to engage in community development activities (which may include housing and economic development activities) primarily within an identified geographic area of operation within the jurisdiction of the grantee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has as its primary purpose the improvement of the physical, economic or social environment of its geographic area of operation by addressing one or more critical problems of the area, with particular attention to the needs of persons of low and moderate income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> May be either non-profit or for-profit, provided any monetary profits to its shareholders or members must be only incidental to its operations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Maintains at least 51 percent of its governing body's membership for low- and moderate-income residents of its geographic area of operation, owners or senior officers of private establishments and other institutions located in and serving its geographic area of operation, or representatives of low- and moderate-income neighborhood organizations located in its geographic area of operation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Is not an agency or instrumentality of the grantee and does not permit more than one-third of the membership of its governing body to be appointed by, or to consist of, elected or other public officials or employees or officials of an ineligible entity (even though such persons may be otherwise qualified under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Except as otherwise authorized in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, requires the members of its governing body to be nominated and approved by the general membership of the organization, or by its permanent governing body; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Is not subject to requirements under which its assets revert to the grantee upon dissolution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Is free to contract for goods and services from vendors of its own choosing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A CBDO that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may also qualify as an eligible entity under this section if it meets one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is an entity organized pursuant to section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 681(d)), including those which are profit making; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is an SBA-approved Section 501 State Development Company or Section 502 Local Development Company, or an SBA Certified Section 503 Company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) under 24 CFR 92.2, designated as a CHDO by the HOME Investment Partnerships program participating jurisdiction, with a geographic area of operation of no more than one neighborhood, and has received HOME funds under 24 CFR 92.300 or is expected to receive HOME funds as described in and documented in accordance with 24 CFR 92.300(e); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is a tribal-based nonprofit organization. Such organizations are associations or corporations duly organized to promote and undertake community development activities on a not-for-profit basis within an identified service area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A CBDO that does not qualify under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section may also be determined to qualify as an eligible entity under this section if the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of HUD, through the provision of information regarding the organization's charter and by-laws, that the organization is sufficiently similar in purpose, function, and scope to those entities qualifying under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p>
