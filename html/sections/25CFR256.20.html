                            <p class="depth0">The servicing housing office must follow Federal procurement or  other Bureau-approved tribal procurement policy. Generally, your  servicing housing office develops a ``bid specification'' or statement  of work, which identifies the work to be performed. The appropriate  contracting office uses the ``bid specification'' to provide information  and invite bids on the project to interested parties. The contracting  office selects the winning bidder after technical review of the bids by  and written recommendation from the servicing housing office, and after  determination that the bidder is qualified and capable of completing the  project as advertised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payments to the winning bidder are negotiated in the contract  and based on specified delivery of services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partial payments will not exceed 80 percent of the value of the  completed work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final payment will be made after final inspection and after all  provisions of the contract have been met, including punch list items.</p>
