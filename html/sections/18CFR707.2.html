                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this NEPA rule is to establish Water Resources  Council (WRC) policy and procedures which supplement the CEQ NEPA  regulations by making them more specifically applicable to our  activities and which implement Sec. 1507.3 (a) and (b) of the CEQ NEPA  regulations. This rule will be revised to incorporate detailed  procedures integrating NEPA and the Principles and Standards (P&S;) and  applicable parts of the procedures for Federal participants in the  preparation of comprehensive regional or river basin plans when these  procedures are developed. This NEPA rule must be used in conjunction  with the CEQ NEPA regulations. Compliance with both the CEQ NEPA  regulations and this NEPA rule is required. Information in the CEQ NEPA  regulations generally is not repeated here to avoid needless  duplication. This NEPA rule supersedes WRC Policy Statement No. 2-- Environmental Statements-Framework Studies and Assessments and Regional  or River Basin Plans.</p>
