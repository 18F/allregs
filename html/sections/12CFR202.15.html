                                Sec. 202.15  Incentives for self-testing and self-correction.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voluntary self-testing and correction. The  report or results of a self-test that a creditor voluntarily conducts  (or authorizes) are privileged as provided in this section. Data  collection required by law or by any governmental authority is not a  voluntary self-test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrective action required. The privilege in this section  applies only if the creditor has taken or is taking appropriate  corrective action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other privileges. The privilege created by this section does not  preclude the assertion of any other privilege that may also apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Self-test defined--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. A self-test is any program,  practice, or study that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is designed and used specifically to determine the extent or  effectiveness of a creditor's compliance with the Act or this  regulation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Creates data or factual information that is not available and  cannot be   derived from loan or application files or other records related to  credit transactions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Types of information privileged. The privilege under this  section applies to the report or results of the self-test, data or  factual information created by the self-test, and any analysis,  opinions, and conclusions pertaining to the self-test report or results.  The privilege covers workpapers or draft documents as well as final  documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Types of information not privileged. The privilege under this  section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information about whether a creditor conducted a self-test, the  methodology used or the scope of the self-test, the time period covered  by the self-test, or the dates it was conducted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Loan and application files or other business records related to  credit transactions, and information derived from such files and  records, even if the information has been aggregated, summarized, or  reorganized to facilitate analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appropriate corrective action--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirement. For the  privilege in this section to apply, appropriate corrective action is  required when the self-test shows that it is more likely than not that a  violation occurred, even though no violation has been formally  adjudicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action. A  creditor must take corrective action that is reasonably likely to remedy  the cause and effect of a likely violation by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifying the policies or practices that are the likely cause  of the violation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assessing the extent and scope of any violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Types of relief. Appropriate corrective action may include both  prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege  under this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a  tester used in a self-test;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A creditor is only required to provide remedial relief to an  applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more  likely than not violated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a  particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the  violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self- test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No admission of violation. Taking corrective action is not an  admission that a violation occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Scope of privilege--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The report or results of a  privileged self-test may not be obtained or used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By a government agency in any examination or investigation  relating to compliance with the Act or this regulation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By a government agency or an applicant (including a prospective  applicant who alleges a violation of Sec. 202.4(b)) in any proceeding  or civil action in which a violation of the Act or this regulation is  alleged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loss of privilege. The report or results of a self-test are not  privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the creditor or a  person with lawful access to the report or results:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Voluntarily discloses any part of the report or results, or any  other information privileged under this section, to an applicant or  government agency or to the public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discloses any part of the report or results, or any other  information privileged under this section, as a defense to charges that  the creditor has violated the Act or regulation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fails or is unable to produce written or recorded information  about the self-test that is required to be retained under Sec.  202.12(b)(6) when the information is needed to determine whether the  privilege applies. This paragraph does not limit any other penalty or  remedy that may be available for a violation of Sec. 202.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> remains privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.</p>
