                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section specifies how to determine maximum test  speed from a lug curve. This maximum test speed is used in Secs. 94.105,  94.106, and Sec. 94.109 (including the tolerances for engine speed  specified in Sec. 94.105).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generation of lug curve. Prior to beginning emission testing,  generate maximum measured brakepower versus engine speed data points  using the applicable method specified in 40 CFR 1065.510. These data  points form the lug curve. It is not necessary to generate the entire  lug curve. For the portion of the curve where power increases with  increasing speed, it is not necessary to generate points with power less  than 90 percent of the maximum power value. For the portion of the curve  where power decreases with increasing speed, it is not necessary to  generate points with power less than 75 percent of the maximum power  value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Normalization of lug curve. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify the point (power and  speed) on the lug curve at which maximum power occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normalize the power values of the lug curve by dividing them by  the maximum power value identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  and multiplying the resulting values by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Normalize the engine speed values of the lug curve by dividing  them by the speed at which maximum power occurs, which is identified in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and multiplying the resulting values  by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Maximum engine power is located on the normalized lug curve at  100 percent power and 100 percent speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a given combination of engine power and speed (i.e., a given  power/speed point), the speedfactor is the distance to the normalized  power/speed point from the zero power, zero speed point. The value of  the speedfactor is defined as:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate speedfactors for the power/speed data points on the  lug curve, and determine the maximum value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maximum test speed is the speed at which the maximum value for  the speedfactor occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For constant-speed engines, rated speed is the maximum test  speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For Category 3 engines, manufacturers may choose to set the  maximum   test speed at the maximum in-use engine speed instead of the speed  specified in Sec. 94.107(d).
