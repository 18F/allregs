                            <p class="depth0">Sections 113(g)-(i) and 118 of the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration Organization Act (hereinafter ``NTIA  Organization Act''), as amended (47 U.S.C. 923(g)-(i) and 928), govern  the procedures and requirements related to the relocation of and sharing  by Eligible Federal Entities' spectrum-related operations in certain  spectrum bands reallocated from Federal to non-Federal use or to   shared use. Pursuant to these statutory provisions, Eligible Federal  Entities authorized to use Eligible Frequencies are entitled to payment  from the Spectrum Relocation Fund for their documented relocation or  sharing costs incurred as a result of planning for an auction of such  frequencies or the reallocation of such frequencies from Federal use to  exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use. The purpose of this part is  to implement the particular provisions that mandate the adoption of such  regulations, after public notice and comment, and that primarily affect  non-Federal spectrum users, including the regulations herein governing  Technical Panels and Dispute Resolution Boards.</p>
