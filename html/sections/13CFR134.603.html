                                Sec. 134.603  What is an adversary adjudication?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, adversary adjudications are administrative proceedings before OHA which involve SBA as a party and which are required to be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (``ALJ''). These adjudications (``administrative proceedings'') include those proceedings listed in Sec. 134.102 (a), (i), and (j)(1), but do not include other OHA proceedings such as those listed in Sec. 134.102(k). In order for

an administrative proceeding to qualify, SBA must have been represented by counsel or by another representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding.</p>
