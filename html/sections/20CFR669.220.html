                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In those local workforce investment areas where the grantee  operates its NFJP, the grantee is a required partner of the local One- Stop delivery system and is subject to the provisions relating to such  partners described in 20 CFR part 662. Consistent with those provisions,  the grantee and the Local Board must negotiate an MOU which meets the  requirements of 20 CFR 662.300 and sets forth their respective  responsibilities for making the full range of services available through  the One-Stop system available to farmworkers. Where the Local Board is  an alternative entity under 20 CFR 661.330, the NFJP grantee must  negotiate with the Board on the terms of its MOU and the scope of its  on-going role in the local workforce investment system, as specified in  20 CFR 661.310(b)(2). In local areas where the grantee does not operate  its NFJP and there is a large concentration of MSFW's, the grantee   may consider the availability of electronic connections and other means  to participate in the One-stop system in that area, in order to serve  those individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The MOU must provide for appropriate and equitable services to  MSFW's, and may include costs of services to MSFW's incurred by the One- Stop that extend beyond Wagner-Peyser funded services and activities.</p>
