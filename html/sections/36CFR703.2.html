In such instances, the Library shall refer requesters to the  agency or organization that originated the records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In order to avoid disruption of work in progress, and in the  interests of fairness to those who might be adversely affected by the  release of information which has not been fully reviewed to assure its  accuracy and completeness, it is the policy of the Library not to  provide records which are part of on-going reviews or other current  projects. In response to such requests, the Library will inform the  requester of the estimated completion date of the review or project so  that the requester may then ask for the records. At that time, the  Library may release the records unless the same are exempt from  disclosure as identified in Sec. 703.5.</p>
