                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable  to cable operators for which the basic service tier is regulated by  local franchising authorities or the Commission, or, with respect to a  cable programming services tier, for which a complaint has been filed  with the Commission. The requirements of this section are applicable for  purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost- of-service showings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accounting requirements.

Sec.  76.922(g) through 76.922(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cable programming services cost category. The cable programming  services category shall include the cost of providing cable programming  services as defined by Sec.  76.901(b). This service cost category shall  contain subcategories that represent each programming tier that is  offered as a part of the operator's cable programming services. All  costs that are allocated to the cable programming service cost cateogry  shall be further allocated among the programming tiers in this category.  The cable programming service cost category may include only allowable  costs as defined in Sec.  76.922(g) through 76.922(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All other services cost category.

After costs have  been directly assigned to and allocated among the service cost  categories and the equipment basket, cable operators that have  aggregated costs at a higher level than the franchise level must  identify all applicable costs at the franchise level in the following  manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recoverable costs that have been identified at the highest  organizational level at which costs have been identified shall be  allocated to the next (lower) organizational level at which recoverable  costs have been identified on the basis of the ratio of the total number  of subscribers served at the lower level to the total number of  subscribers served at the higher level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cable operators shall repeat the procedure specified in  paragraph (g)(1) of this section at every organizational level at which  recoverable costs have been identified until such costs have been  allocated to the franchise level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is  divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated  with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a  reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services  shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transactions and affiliates. Adjustments on account of external  costs and rates set on a cost-of-service basis shall exclude any amounts  not calculated in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Charges for assets purchased by or transferred to the regulated  activity of a cable operator from affiliates shall equal the invoice  price if that price is determined by a prevailing company price. The  invoice price is the prevailing company price if the affiliate has sold  a substantial number of like assets to nonaffiliates. If a prevailing  company price for the assets received by the regulated activity is not  available, the changes for such assets shall be the lower of their cost  to the originating activity of the affiliated group less all applicable  valuation reserves, or their fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The proceeds from assets sold or transferred from the regulated  activity of the cable operator to affiliates shall equal the prevailing  company price if the cable operator has sold a substantial number of  like assets to nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price is not  available, the proceeds from such sales shall be determined at the  higher of cost less all applicable valuation reserves, or estimated fair  market value of the asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Charges for services provided to the regulated activity of a  cable operator by an affiliate shall equal the invoice price if that  price is determined by a prevailing company price. The invoice price is  the prevailing company price if the affiliate has sold like services to  a substantial number of nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price for  the services received by the regulated activity is not available, the  charges of such services shall be at cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The proceeds from services sold or transferred from the  regulated activity of the cable operator to affiliates shall equal the  prevailing company price if the cable operator has sold like services to  a substantial number of nonaffiliates. If a prevailing company price is  not available, the proceeds from such sales shall be determined at cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of Sec.  76.924(i)(1) through 76.924(i)(4), costs  shall be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures  specified in Sec.  76.922 and paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For purposes of this section, entities are affiliated if either  entity has an attributable interest in the other or if a third party has  an attributable interest in both entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Attributable interest shall be defined by reference to the  criteria set forth in Notes 1 through 5 to Sec.  76.501 provided,  however, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The limited partner and LLC/LLP/RLLP insulation provisions of  Note 2(f) shall not apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of Note 2(a) regarding five (5) percent  interests shall include all voting or nonvoting stock or limited  partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude  from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of  regulated cable service, equipment, and leased commercial access, any  direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of  such services.
