                            <p class="depth0">USERRA's definition of ``employer'' includes a successor in interest. In general, an employer is a successor in interest where there is a substantial continuity in operations, facilities, and workforce from the former employer. The determination whether an employer is a successor in interest must be made on a case-by-case basis using a multi-factor test that considers the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether there has been a substantial continuity of business operations from the former to the current employer;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether the current employer uses the same or similar facilities, machinery, equipment, and methods of production;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether there has been a substantial continuity of employees;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether there is a similarity of jobs and working conditions;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whether there is a similarity of supervisors or managers; and,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whether there is a similarity of products or services.</p>
