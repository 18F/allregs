A qualified energy conservation measure is a demand-side measure not operational until the period of applicability, implemented in the residence or facility of a customer to whom the utility sells electricity, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is specified in appendix A(1) of this subpart; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a device or material that is not included in appendix A(1) of this subpart,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is a cost-effective demand-side measure consistent with an applicable least-cost plan or least-cost planning process that increases the efficiency of the customer's use of electricity (as measured in accordance with Sec. 73.82(c)) without increasing the use by the customer of any fuel other than qualified renewable energy, industrial waste heat, or, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, industrial waste gases;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is implemented pursuant to a conservation program approved by the utility regulatory authority, which certifies that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and is not excluded by paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is reported by the applicant in its application to the Reserve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-qualified energy conservation measures.
