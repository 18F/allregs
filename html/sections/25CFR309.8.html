                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The recommended method of marketing authentic Indian products is  to include the name of the artist or artisan, the name of the Tribe in  which the artist or artisan is enrolled, and the individual's Tribal  enrollment number. If the individual is a certified non-member Indian  artisan, rather than an enrolled Tribal member, the product  identification should include the name of the Tribe providing official  written certification that the individual is a non-member Indian artisan  and the date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe. In  order for an individual to be certified by an Indian Tribe as a non- member Indian artisan, the individual must be of Indian lineage of one  or more members of such Indian Tribe and the certification must be  issued in writing by the governing   body of an Indian Tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function  by the governing body of the Indian Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For example, the Indian product should include a label, hangtag,  provenance card, or similar identification that includes W (name of the  artist or artisan), and X (name of the Tribe in which the individual is  enrolled) and Y (individual's Tribal enrollment number), or a statement  that the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan of Z (name  of the Tribe providing certification and the date upon which the  certification was issued by the Tribe).
