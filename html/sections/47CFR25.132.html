Applications for transmitting NGSO FSS earth stations operating in the 20/30 GHz band must include the antenna measurements specified in Sec. 25.138(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following measurements on a production antenna performed on calibrated antenna range, as a minimum, must be made at the bottom, middle and top of each allocated frequency band:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following measurements on a production antenna performed on calibrated antenna range, as a minimum, must be made at the bottom, middle and top of each allocated frequency band:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Co-polarized patterns in the E- and H-planes for linear-polarized antennas or in two orthogonal cuts for circularly-polarized antennas:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the azimuth plane, plus and minus 7 degrees and plus and minus 180 degrees from beam peak.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the elevation plane, 0 to 45 degrees from beam peak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cross-polarization patterns in the E- and H-planes for linear-polarized antennas or in two orthogonal cuts for circularly-polarized antennas, plus and minus 9 degrees from beam peak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Main beam gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FCC envelope specified in Sec. 25.209 shall be superimposed on each pattern.

If on-site data is to be used for qualification, the test frequencies and number of patterns should follow, where possible, the recommendations in paragraph (b) of this section, and the test data is to be submitted in the same manner as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each new or modified transmitting antenna over 3 meters in diameter, except antennas subject to measurement under Sec. 25.138(d), the following on-site verification measurements must be completed at one frequency on an available transponder in each frequency band of interest and submitted to the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Co-polarized patterns in the elevation plane, plus and minus 7 degrees, in the transmit band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Co-polarized patterns in the azimuth and elevation planes, plus and minus 7 degrees, in the receive band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> System cross-polarization discrimination on-axis.

with the satellite system control center under the provisions of Sec. 25.272.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification that the tests required by paragraph (c) of this section have been satisfactorily performed shall be provided to the Commission in notification that construction of the facilities has been completed as required by Sec. 25.133.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Antennas less than 3 meters in diameter and antennas on simple (manual) drive mounts that are operated at a fixed site are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provided that a detailed technical showing is made that confirms proper installation, pointing procedures, and polarization alignment and manufacturing quality control. These showing must also include a plan for periodic testing and field installation procedures and precautions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records of the results of the tests required by this section must be maintained at the antenna site or the earth station operator's control center and be available for inspection.
