                                Sec. 404.1401  What is the interrelationship between the Railroad Program of the Social Security Act?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background. The Railroad Retirement Act provides a system of  benefits for railroad employees, their dependents and survivors, and is  integrated with the Social Security Act to provide a coordinated system  of retirement, survivor, dependent and disability benefits payable on  the basis of an individual's work in the railroad industry and in  employment and self-employment covered by the Social Security Act. With  respect to the coordination between the two programs, the Railroad  Retirement Act distinguishes between ``career'' or ``vested'' railroad  workers and those individuals who may be considered ``casual'' or ``non- vested'' railroad workers based on the total amount of railroad service  credited to the worker, as explained in paragraph (b) of this section.  The Railroad Retirement Board transfers to the Social Security  Administration (SSA) the compensation records of workers who at the time  of retirement, onset of disability or death, are non-vested and meet  certain other requirements. Any compensation paid to non-vested workers  for service after 1936 becomes wages   under the Social Security Act (to the extent they do not exceed the  annual wage limitations described in Sec. 404.1047). Any benefits  payable to non-vested workers, their dependents, and their survivors,  are computed on the basis of the combined compensation and social  security covered earnings creditable to the workers' records. Once a  railroad worker meets the vesting requirements, the record of the  worker's railroad service and compensation generally may not be used for  benefit purposes under the Social Security Act, but under certain  circumstances may be transferred after the worker's death to SSA for use  in determining social security benefit entitlement for the railroad  worker's survivors (see Sec. 404.1407). Under certain circumstances (see  Sec. 404.1413), certification of benefits payable under the provisions  of the Social Security Act will be made to the Railroad Retirement  Board. The Railroad Retirement Board will certify such benefits to the  Secretary of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who is a vested railroad worker? You are a vested railroad  worker if you have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ten years or more of service in the railroad industry, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective January 1, 2002, you have at least 5 years of service  in the railroad industry, all of which accrue after December 31, 1995.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definition of years of service. As used in paragraph (b) of this  section, the term years of service has the same meaning as assigned to  it by section 1(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as amended,  (45 U.S.C. 231(f)).
