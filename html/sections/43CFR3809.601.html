A significant violation is one that causes or may result in environmental or other harm or danger or that substantially deviates from the

complete notice or approved plan of operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> BLM notifies you of its intent to issue a suspension order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> BLM provides you an opportunity for an informal hearing before the BLM State Director to object to a suspension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BLM may order an immediate, temporary suspension of all or any part of your operations without issuing a noncompliance order, notifying you in advance, or providing you an opportunity for an informal hearing if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You do not comply with any provision of your notice, plan of operations, or this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An immediate, temporary suspension is necessary to protect health, safety, or the environment from imminent danger or harm. BLM may presume that an immediate suspension is necessary if you conduct plan-level operations without an approved plan of operations or conduct notice-level operations without submitting a complete notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> BLM will terminate a suspension order under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section when BLM determines you have corrected the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contents of enforcement orders.
