                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply only if a fuel claims emission reduction benefits from fuel parameters that are not included in the complex emission model or complex emission model database, or if the values of fuel parameters included in the complex emission model set forth in Sec. 80.45 fall outside the range of values for which the complex emission model is deemed valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To augment the complex emission model described at Sec. 80.45, the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The petitioner must obtain prior approval from the Administrator for the design of the test program before beginning the vehicle testing process. To obtain approval, the petitioner must at minimum provide the following information: the fuel parameter to be evaluated for emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to be used in the test fleet, including model year, model name, vehicle identification number (VIN), mileage, emission performance (exhaust THC emission level), technology type, and manufacturer; a description of the methods used to procure and prepare the vehicles; the properties of the fuels to be used in the testing program (as specified at Sec. 80.49); the pollutants and emission categories intended to be evaluated; the precautions used to ensure that the effects of the parameter in question are independent of the effects of other parameters already included in the model; a description of the quality assurance procedures to be used during the test program; the statistical analysis techniques to be used in analyzing the test data, and the identity and location of the organization performing the testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exhaust emissions shall be measured per the requirements of this section and Sec. 80.49 through Sec. 80.62.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The nonexhaust emission model (including evaporative, running loss, and refueling VOC and toxics emissions) shall not be augmented by vehicle testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Agency reserves the right to observe and monitor any testing that is performed pursuant to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Agency reserves the right to evaluate the quality and suitability of data submitted pursuant to the requirements of this section and to reject, re-analyze, or otherwise evaluate such data as is technically warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator, the Administrator may approve a petition to waive the requirements of this section and Sec. 80.49, Sec. 80.50(a), Sec. 80.60(d)(3), and Sec. 80.60(d)(4) in

order to better optimize the test program to the needs of the particular fuel parameter. Any such waiver petition should provide information justifying the requested waiver, including an acceptable rationale and supporting data. Petitioners must obtain approval from the Administrator prior to conducting testing for which the requirements in question are waived. The Administrator may waive the noted requirements in whole or in part, and may impose appropriate conditions on any such waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at Sec. 80.45 with a new parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each emitter class category. If the parameter is not included in the complex model but is represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the petitioner shall be required to demonstrate the emission effects of the parameter in question independent of the effects of the already-included parameters. The petitioner shall also have to demonstrate the effects of the already-included parameters independent of the effects of the parameter in question. The emission performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at Sec. 80.49, as measured through vehicle testing in accordance with Sec. 80.50 through Sec. 80.62, shall be analyzed to determine the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions according to the following procedure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The analysis shall fit a regression model to the natural logarithm of emissions measured from addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 only (as specified at Sec. 80.49(a) and adjusted as per paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and Sec. 80.49(d)) that includes the following terms:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form DixVi, where Di is the coefficient for the term and Vi is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A linear term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form Aix(P1-P1 (avg))xEi, where Ai is the coefficient for the term, P1 is the level of the parameter in question, P1 (avg) is the average level of the parameter in question for all seven test fuels specified at Sec. 80.49(a)(1), and Ei is a dummy variable representing emitter class, as defined at Sec. 80.62. For normal emitters, E1 = 1 and E2 = 0. For higher emitters, E1 = 0 and E2 = 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the VOC and NOX models, a squared term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form Bix(P1-P1 (avg))\2\xEi, where Bi is the coefficient for the term and where P1 , P1 (avg), and Ei are as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To the extent that the properties of fuels 1, 2, and 3 which are incorporated in the complex model differ in value among the three fuels, the complex model shall be used to adjust the observed emissions from test vehicles on those fuels to compensate for those differences prior to fitting the regression model.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Ai and Bi terms and coefficients developed by the regression described in this paragraph (c) shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. If both terms satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be retained. If the Bi term satisfies these criteria and the Ai term does not, then both terms shall be retained. If the Bi term does not satisfy these criteria, then the Bi term shall be dropped from the regression model and the model shall be re-estimated. If, after dropping the Bi term and re-estimating the model, the Ai term does not satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be dropped, all test data shall be reported to EPA, and the augmentation request shall be denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After completing the steps outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the analysis shall fit a regression model to a combined data set that includes vehicle testing results from all seven addition fuels specified at Sec. 80.49(a), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at Sec. 80.45, and vehicle testing results used to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The analysis shall fit the regression models described in paragraphs

(c)(2) (ii) through (v) of this section to the natural logarithm of measured emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All regressions shall include a term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form DixVi, where Di is the coefficient for the term and Vi is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all seven fuels specified at Sec. 80.49(a). Note that the Di estimates for the petitioner's test vehicles in this regression are likely to differ from the Di estimates discussed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section since they will be based on a different set of fuels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All regressions shall include existing complex model terms and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. All terms and coefficients shall be expressed in centered form. The Administrator shall make available upon request existing complex model terms and coefficients in centered form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All regressions shall include the linear and squared terms, and their coefficients, estimated in the final regression model described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The VOC and NOX regressions shall include those interactive terms with other fuel parameters, of the form Ci(1, j) x (P1 - P1 (avg)) x (Pj - Pj (avg)) x Ei, where Ci(1, j) is the coefficient for the term, P1 is the level of the parameter being added to the model, P1 (avg) is the average level of the parameter being added for all seven addition fuels specified at Sec. 80.49(a), Pj is the level of the other fuel parameter, Pj (avg) is the centering value for the other fuel parameter used to develop the complex model or used in the other parameter's augmentation study, and Ei is as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which are found to satisfy the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Such terms shall be added to the regression model in a stepwise manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The model described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Once the augmented models described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section have been developed, they shall be converted to an uncentered form through appropriate algebraic manipulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The augmented model described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used to determine the effects of the parameter in question at levels between the levels in Fuels 1 and 3, as defined at Sec. 80.49(a)(1), for all fuels which claim emission benefits from the parameter in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at Sec. 80.45 by extending the range of an existing complex model parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each technology group and emitter class category, at levels between the extension level and the nearest limit of the core of the data used to develop the unaugmented complex model as follows:
