                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of payment in coal trespass. For coal trespass in  a State where there is no State law governing such trespass, the measure  of damages will be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For innocent trespass, payment must be made for the value of the  coal in place before severance. United States v. Homestake Mining  Company (117 Fed. 481).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For willful trespass, payment must be made for the full value of  the coal at the time of conversion without deduction for labor bestowed  or expense incurred in removing and marketing the coal. Liberty Bell  Gold Mining Company v. Smuggler-Union Mining Company (203 Fed. 795). The  mining of coal in trespass is presumed to be willful, in the absence of  persuasive evidence of the innocence and good faith of the trespasser.  United States v. Ute Coal and Coke Company (158 Fed. 20).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coal mined when there is no lease in effect. Any mining of coal  which is not pursuant to a coal lease in effect at the time of the  mining shall constitute a trespass, and the coal so mined must be paid  for on a trespass basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coal mined by successful bidder at public sale. The successful  bidder at public sale for a coal leasing unit does not acquire any right  to mine coal until he has complied with all the formalities required by  the regulations, including the furnishing of a bond, and a lease has  been issued to him. Coal mined by such applicant prior to the date of  the issuance of a lease is in trespass and must be paid for on a  trespass basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Coal permit, lease, or license not to issue until trespass  account settled. No coal permit, lease, or license will be issued to  anyone known to have mined coal in trespass until the trespass account  is settled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right of surface owner to mine coal for domestic use. The owner  of land patented with a reservation of the coal deposits, either under  the act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 844; 30 U.S.C. 81), or under the Act  of June 22, 1910 (36 Stat. 583; 30 U.S.C. 83-85), has the right to mine  coal for use upon the land for domestic purposes at any time prior to  the disposal by the United States of the coal deposits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Penalties for unauthorized exploration for coal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person  who willfully conducts coal exploration for commercial purposes without  an exploration license issued under subpart 3507 of this chapter shall  be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for each day of violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All data collected by said person on any Federal lands as a  result of such   violations shall immediately be made available to the Secretary, who  shall make the data available to the public as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No penalty under this section may be assessed unless such person  is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such  violation pursuant to part 4 of this chapter.  [35 FR 9800, June 13, 1970, as amended at 41 FR 36023, Aug. 26, 1976; 42  FR 4460, Jan. 25, 1977]</p>
