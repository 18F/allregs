Report should state whether aims have changed from original application and if they have, provided revised aims. Include results of work to date. Emphasize findings and their significance to the field, and any real or anticipated problems. A completed budget page must be submitted with the continuation progress report when a change to anticipated future costs will exceed 25 percent of the original recommended future budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of Energy R&D; Project.
