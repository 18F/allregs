                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fair Market Rent limitation. The Fair Market Rent Schedule for Moderate Rehabilitation is 120 percent of the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule, except that the Fair Market Rent limitation applicable to single room occupancy housing is 75 percent of the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent for a 0-bedroom unit. The initial Gross Rent for any Moderate Rehabilitation unit must not exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed except by up to 10 percent as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Additionally, to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the PHA may approve changes in the Contract Rent subsequent to execution of the Agreement which result in an initial Gross Rent which exceeds the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit by up to 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exception rents. With HUD Field Office approval, the PHA may approve initial Gross Rents which exceed the applicable Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rents by up to 10 percent for all units of a given size in specified areas where HUD has determined that the rents for standard units suitable for the Existing Housing Program are more than 10 percent higher than the Existing Housing Fair Market Rents. The PHA must submit documentation demonstrating the necessity for such exception rents in the area to the HUD Field Office. In areas where HUD has approved the use of exception rents for 0-bedroom units, the single room occupancy housing exception rent will be 75 percent of the exception rent applicable to Moderate Rehabilitation 0-bedroom units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination Initial Contract Rents. (1) The initial Contract Rent and base rent for each unit must be computed in accordance with HUD requirements. These amounts may be determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), or in accordance with an alternative method prescribed by HUD. However, the initial Contract Rent may in no event be more than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed, minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any applicable allowance for utilities and other services attributable to the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the initial Contract Rent is computed under this paragraph, the rent will be equal to the base rent plus the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan (but not more than the maximum stated in paragraph (c)(1)). The base rent must be calculated using the rent charged for the unit or the estimated costs to the Owner of owning, managing and maintaining the rehabilitated unit. The monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan must be calculated using:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The actual interest rate on the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The HUD-FHA maximum interest rate for multifamily housing (or another rate prescribed by HUD) for rehabilitation costs paid by the Owner out of nonborrowed funds, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least a 15 year loan term, except that if the total amount of rehabilitation is less than $15,000, the actual loan term will be used for the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner. (HUD Field Offices may authorize loan terms which differ from the above in accordance with HUD requirements.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in Initial Contract Rents during rehabilitation. (1) The initial Contract Rents established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract except under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When, during rehabilitation, work items (including substantial and necessary design changes) which (A) could not reasonably have been anticipated or are necessitated by a change in local codes or ordinances, and (B) were not listed in the work write-up prepared or approved by the PHA, are subsequently required and approved by the PHA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the actual cost of the rehabilitation performed is less than that estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement or the actual, certified costs are more than estimated due to unforeseen factors beyond the owner's control (e.g., strikes, weather delays or unexpected delays caused by local governments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the PHA (or HUD) approves changes in financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When the actual relocation payments made by the Owner to temporarily relocated Families varies from the cost estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When necessary to correct errors in computation of the base and Contract Rents to comply with the HUD requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Should changes occur as specified in paragraph (d)(1) (either an increase or decrease), the PHA will approve any necessary change in work and amendment of the work write-up and cost estimate, recalculate the initial Contract Rents in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and amend the Contract or Agreement, as appropriate, to reflect the revised rents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In establishing the revised Contract Rents, the PHA must determine that the resulting Gross Rents do not exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or the exception rent in effect at the time of execution of the Agreement. The Fair Market Rent or exception rent, as appropriate, may only be exceeded when the PHA determines in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section that it will be necessary for the revised Gross Rent to exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent. Should this determination be made, the PHA may not execute a revised Agreement or Contract for Gross Rents exceeding the Fair Market Rents by more than 10 percent until it receives HUD Field Office approval. The HUD Field Office may approve revised Gross Rents which exceed the Fair Market Rents by up to 20 percent for reasons specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon proper justification by the PHA of the necessity for the increase.
