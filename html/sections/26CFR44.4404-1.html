                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The tax imposed by section 4401 applies to wagers  (1) accepted in the United States, or (2) placed by a person who is in  the United States (i) with a person who is a citizen or resident of the  United States, or (ii) in a wagering pool or lottery conducted by a  person who is a citizen or resident of the United States. All wagers  made within the United States are taxable irrespective of the  citizenship or place of residence of the parties to the wager. Thus, the  tax applies to wagers placed within the United States, even though the  person for whom or on whose behalf the wagers are received is located in  a foreign country and is not a citizen or resident of the United States.  Likewise, a wager accepted outside the United States by a citizen or  resident of the United States is taxable if the person making such wager  is within the United States at the time the wager is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A syndicate which maintains its headquarters in a foreign  country has representatives in the United States who receive wagers in  the United States for or on behalf of such syndicate. For the purposes  of section 4404, such wagers are considered as accepted within the  United States, the syndicate is considered to be in the business of  accepting wagers within the United States, and such wagers are subject  to the tax. This is true regardless of the nationality or residence of  the members of the syndicate.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. A Canadian citizen employed in Detroit, Michigan,  telephones a horse race bet to a bookmaker who is a United States  citizen with his place of business located in Windsor, Canada. The wager  is taxable since it is made by a person within the United States with a  person who is a United States citizen.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. A United States citizen while visiting Tijuana, Mexico,  makes a wager on the outcome of a horse race with a bookmaker who is  also a United States citizen located and doing business in Tijuana. The  wager is not taxable since both parties to the wager, though United  States citizens, were outside the United States at the time the wager  was made.</p>
