                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Motion to postpone. A hearing may be postponed by the Judge on  his own initiative or for good cause shown upon the motion of a party. A  motion for postponement shall state the position of the other parties,  either by a joint motion or by a representation of the moving party. The  filing of a motion for postponement does not automatically postpone a  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grounds for postponement. A motion for postponement grounded on  conflicting engagements of counsel or employment of new counsel shall be  filed promptly after notice is given of the hearing, or as soon as the  conflict is learned of or the engagement occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When motion must be received. A motion to postpone a hearing  must be received at least 7 days prior to the hearing. A motion for  postponement received less than 7 days prior to the hearing will  generally be denied unless good cause is shown for late filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Postponement in excess of 60 days. No postponement in excess of  60 days shall be granted without the concurrence of the Chief  Administrative Law Judge. The original of any motion seeking a  postponement in excess of 60 days shall be filed with the Judge and a  copy sent to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
