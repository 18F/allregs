                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delegation of authority to servicers to review liquidation  appraisals and determine reasonable value. Based on the reasonable  value, the servicer will be able to determine net value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for delegation of authority to review VA  liquidation appraisals and determine the reasonable value for  liquidation purposes on properties secured by VA guaranteed or insured  loans, a lender must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have automatic processing authority under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employ one or more Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SAR) acceptable  to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To qualify as a servicer's staff appraisal reviewer an applicant  must be a full-time member of the servicer's permanent staff and may not  be employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgagee. The  individual must not engage in any private pursuits in which there will  be, or appear to be, any conflict of interest between those pursuits and  his/her duties, responsibilities, and performance as a Servicer  Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) staff appraisal reviewer. Three  years of appraisal related experience is necessary to qualify as a  servicer's staff appraisal reviewer. That experience must demonstrate  knowledge of, and the ability to apply industry-accepted principles,  methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to  competently determine the value of property. The individual must  demonstrate the ability to review the work of others and to recognize  deviations from accepted appraisal principle, practices, and techniques,  error in computations, and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Servicers that have a staff appraisal reviewer determined  acceptable to VA, will be authorized to review liquidation appraisals  and make reasonable value determinations for liquidation purposes on  properties that are the security for VA guaranteed or insured loans.  Additionally, servicers must satisfy initial VA office case review  requirements prior to being allowed to determine reasonable value  without VA involvement. The initial office case review requirement must  be satisfied in the VA regional loan center in whose jurisdiction the  servicer's staff appraisal reviewer is located before the SAPP authority  may be utilized by that servicer in any other VA office's jurisdiction.  To satisfy the initial office case review requirement, the first five  cases of each servicer staff appraisal reviewer involving properties in  the regional office location where the staff appraisal reviewer is  located will be processed by him or her up to the point where he or she  has made a reasonable value determination and fully drafted, but not  issued, the servicer's notice of value. At that point, and prior to loan  termination, each of the five cases will be submitted to the VA regional  loan center having jurisdiction over the property. After a staff review  of each case, VA will issue a notice of value which the servicer may use  to compute the net value of the property for liquidation purposes. If  these five cases are found to be acceptable by VA, the servicer's staff  appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent  appraisals for properties regardless of jurisdictional location without  prior submission to VA and issuance by VA of a notice of value. Where  the servicer's reviewer cannot readily meet the jurisdictional review  requirement, the SAR applicant may request that VA expand the geographic  area of consideration. VA will accommodate such requests if practicable.  The initial office case review requirement may be expanded by VA if  acceptable performance has not been demonstrated. After satisfaction of  the   initial office case review requirement, routine reviews of SAPP cases  will be made by VA staff based upon quality control procedures  established by the Undersecretary for Benefits. Such review will be made  on a random sampling or performance related basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certifications required from the servicer will be specified with  particularity in the separate instructions issued by the Secretary, as  noted in Sec. 36.4348(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Instructions for SAPP Procedures. The Secretary will publish  separate instructions for processing appraisals under the Servicer  Appraisal Processing Program. Compliance with these regulations and the  separate instructions issued by the Secretary is deemed by VA to be the  minimum exercise of due diligence in processing SAPP cases. Due  diligence is considered by VA to represent that care, as is to be  properly expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and  prudent servicer who would be dependent on the property as security to  protect its investment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment of value recommendations. The amount of authority to  upwardly adjust the fee appraiser's estimated market value during the  servicer staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal  report or to subsequently process an appeal of the servicer's  established reasonable value will be specified in the separate  instructions issued by VA as noted in Sec. 36.4348(b). The amount  specified must not in any way be considered an administrative adjustment  figure which may be applied indiscriminately and without valid basis or  justification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjustment during initial review. Any adjustment during the  staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report must  be fully and clearly justified in writing on the appraisal report form  or, if necessary, on an addendum. The basis for the adjustment must be  adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards. If real  estate market or other valid data was utilized in arriving at the  decision to make the adjustment, such data must be attached to the  appraisal report. All adjustments, comments, corrections,  justifications, etc., to the appraisal report must be made in a  contrasting color, be clearly legible, and signed and dated by the staff  appraisal reviewer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Processing appeals. The authority provided under 38 U.S.C.  3731(d) which permits a lender to obtain a VA fee panel appraiser's  report which VA is obligated to consider in an appeal of the established  reasonable value shall not apply to cases processed under the authority  provided by this section. All appeals of VA fee appraiser's estimated  market values or servicer's reasonable value determinations above the  amount specified in the separate instructions issued by VA must be  submitted, along with the servicer's recommendations, if any, to VA for  processing and final determination. Unless otherwise authorized in the  separate instructions servicers must also submit appeals, regardless of  the amount, to VA in all cases where the staff appraisal reviewer has  made an adjustment during their initial review of the appraisal report  to the fee appraiser's market value estimate. The fee appraiser's  estimated market value or servicer's reasonable value determination may  be increased only when such increase is clearly warranted and fully  supported by real estate market or other valid data considered adequate  and reasonable by professional appraisal standards and the servicer's  staff appraisal reviewer clearly and fully justifies the reasoning and  basis for the increase in writing on the appraisal report form or an  addendum. The staff appraisal reviewer must date and sign the written  justification and must cite within it the data used in arriving at the  decision to make the increase. All such data shall be attached to the  appraisal report form and any addendum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Indemnification. When the Secretary has incurred a loss as a  result of a payment of claim under guaranty and in which the Secretary  determines an increase made by the servicer under Sec. 36.4348(c) was  unwarranted, or arbitrary and capricious, the lender shall indemnify the  Secretary to the extent the Secretary determines such loss was caused or  increased, by the increase in value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Affiliations. A servicer affiliated with a real estate firm,  builder, land   developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary division, or in any other  entity in which it has a financial interest or which it owns may not use  the authority for any cases involving the affiliate unless the servicer  demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the servicer and its  affiliate(s) are essentially separate entities that operate  independently of each other, free of all cross-influences (e.g., a  formal corporate agreement exists which specifically sets forth this  fact).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Quality control plans. The servicer must have an effective self- policing or quality control system to ensure the adequacy and quality of  their SAPP staff appraisal reviewer's processing and, that its  activities do not deviate from high standards of integrity. The quality  control system must include frequent, periodic audits that specifically  address the appraisal review activity. These audits may be performed by  an independent party, or by the servicer's independent internal audit  division which reports directly to the firm's chief executive officer.  The servicer must agree to furnish findings and information under this  system to VA on demand. While the quality control personnel need not be  appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and  techniques and the ability to prescribe appropriate corrective action(s)  in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are  identified. The basic elements of the system will be described in  separate instructions issued by the Secretary. Copies of the lender's  quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal  related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction with  the servicer's application of SAPP authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fees. The Secretary will require servicers to pay a $100.00  application fee for each SAR the servicer nominates for approval. The  application fee will also apply if the SAR begins work for another  servicer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Withdrawal of servicer authority. The authority for a servicer  to determine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty  Officer when proper cause exists. A servicer's authority to make  reasonable value determinations shall be withdrawn when the servicer no  longer meets the basic requirements for delegating the authority, or  when it can be shown that the servicer's reasonable value determinations  have not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements,  guidelines, instructions or applicable laws, or when there is adequate  evidence to support reasonable belief by VA that a particular  unacceptable act, practice, or performance by the servicer or the  servicer's staff has occurred. Such acts, practices, or performance  include, but are not limited to: Demonstrated technical incompetence  (i.e., conduct which demonstrates an insufficient knowledge of industry  accepted appraisal principles, techniques and practices; or the lack of  technical competence to review appraisal reports and make value  determinations in accordance with those requirements); substantive or  repetitive errors (i.e., any error(s) of a nature that would materially  or significantly affect the determination of reasonable value or  condition of the property; or a number or series of errors that,  considered individually, may not significantly impact the determination  of reasonable value or property condition, but which when considered in  the aggregate would establish that appraisal reviews or SAPP case  processing are being performed in a careless or negligent manner), or  continued instances of disregard for VA requirements after they have  been called to the servicer's attention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withdrawal of authority by the Loan Guaranty Officer may be  either for an indefinite or a specified period of time. For any  withdrawal longer than 90 days a reapplication for servicer authority to  process appraisals under these regulations will be required. Written  notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of withdrawal unless  the Government's interests are exposed to immediate risk from the  servicer's activities in which case the withdrawal will be effected  immediately. The notice will clearly and specifically set forth the  basis and grounds for the action. There is no right to a formal hearing  to contest the withdrawal of SAPP processing privileges. However, if  within 15 days after receiving notice the servicer requests an  opportunity to   contest the withdrawal, the servicer may submit, in person, in writing,  or through a representative, information and argument to the Loan  Guaranty Officer in opposition to the withdrawal. The Loan Guaranty  Officer will make a recommendation to the Regional Loan Center Director  who shall make the determination as to whether the action should be  sustained, modified or rescinded. The servicer will be informed in  writing of the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The servicer has the right to appeal the Regional Loan Center  Director's decision to the Undersecretary for Benefits. In the event of  such an appeal, the Undersecretary for Benefits will review all relevant  material concerning the matter and make a determination that shall  constitute final agency action. If the servicer's submission of  opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the  withdrawal of SAPP authority, the servicer will be afforded an  opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary  evidence, present witnesses and confront any witness the Veterans  Benefits Administration presents. The Undersecretary for Benefits will  appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing. When such  additional proceedings are necessary, the Undersecretary for Benefits  shall base the determination on the facts as found, together with any  information and argument submitted by the servicer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in  which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the  Undersecretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all  the information in the administrative record, including any submission  made by the servicer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawal of the SAPP authority will require that VA make  subsequent determinations of reasonable value for the servicer.  Consequently, VA staff will review each appraisal report and issue a  Notice of Value which can then be used by the servicer to compute the  net value of properties for liquidation purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Withdrawal by VA of the servicer's SAPP authority does not  prevent VA from also withdrawing automatic processing authority or  taking debarment or suspension action based upon the same conduct of the  servicer.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1), 3731 and 3732)  (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection requirements in this section under control numbers 2900-0045  and 2900-0513)  [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008.
