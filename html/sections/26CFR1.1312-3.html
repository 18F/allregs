                                Sec. 1.1312-3  Double exclusion of an item of gross income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Items included in income or with respect to which a tax was  paid. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (3)(A) of section 1312 applies if the determination  requires the exclusion, from a taxpayer's gross income, of an item  included in a return filed by the taxpayer, or with respect to which tax  was paid, and which was erroneously excluded or omitted from the gross  income of the same taxpayer for another taxable year or of a related  taxpayer for the same or another taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer received payments in 1951 under a contract  for the performance of services and included the payments in his return  for that year. After the expiration of the period of limitations for the  assessment of a deficiency for 1950, the Commissioner issued a notice of  deficiency to the taxpayer for the year 1951 based upon adjustments to  other items, and the taxpayer filed a petition with the Tax Court of the  United States and maintained in the proceedings before the Tax Court  that he kept his books on the accrual basis and that the payments  received in 1951 were on income that had accrued and was properly  taxable in 1950. A final decision of the Tax Court was rendered in 1955  excluding the payments from 1951 income. An adjustment in favor of the  Commissioner is authorized with respect to the year 1950, whether or not  a tax had been paid on the income reported in the 1951 return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assume the same facts as in (i), except that the taxpayer had  not included the payments in any return and had not paid a tax thereon.  No adjustment would be authorized under section 1312(3)(A) with respect  to the year 1950. If the taxpayer, however, had paid a deficiency  asserted for 1951 based upon the inclusion of the payments in 1951  income and thereafter successfully sued for refund thereof, an  adjustment would be authorized with respect to the year 1950. (See  paragraph (b) of this section for circumstances under which correction  is authorized with respect to items not included in income and on which  a tax was not paid.)</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. A father and son conducted a partnership business, each  being entitled to one-half of the net profits. The father included the  entire net income of the partnership in his return for 1948, and the son  included no portion of this income in his return for that year. Shortly  before the expiration of the period of limitations with respect to  deficiency assessments and refund claims for both father and son for  1948, the father filed a claim for refund of that portion of his 1948  tax attributable to the half of the partnership income which should have  been included in the son's return. The court sustains the claim for  refund in 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the son's  tax for 1948.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Items not included in income and with respect to which the tax  was not paid. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (3)(B) of section 1312 applies if the  determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item not  included in a return filed by the taxpayer and with respect to which a  tax was not paid, but which is includible in the gross income of the  same taxpayer for another taxable year, or in the gross income of a  related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year. This is one of  the two circumstances in which the maintenance of an inconsistent  position is not a requirement for an adjustment, but the requirements in  paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1311(b)-2 must be fulfilled (correction not  barred at time of erroneous action).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. The taxpayer, A, who computes his income by use of the  accrual method of accounting, performed in 1949 services for which he  received payments in 1949 and 1950. He did not include in his return for  either 1949 or 1950 the payments which he received in 1950, and he paid  no tax with respect to such payments. In 1952 the Commissioner sent a  notice of deficiency to A with respect to the year 1949, contending that  A should have included all of such payments in his return for that year.  A contested the deficiency on the basis that in 1949 he had no accruable  right to the payments which he received in 1950. In 1955 (after the  expiration of the period of limitations for assessing deficiencies with  respect to 1950), the Tax Court sustains A's position. The Commissioner  may assess a deficiency for 1950, since a deficiency assessment for that  year was not barred when he sent the notice of deficiency with respect  to 1949.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. B and C were partners in 1950, each being entitled to  one-half of the profits of the partnership business. During 1950, B  received an item of income which he treated as partnership income so  that his return for that year reflected only 50 percent of such item. C,  however, included no part of such item in any return and paid no tax  with respect thereto. In 1952, the Commissioner sent to C a notice of  deficiency with respect to 1950, contending that his return for that  year should have reflected 50 percent of such item. C contested the  deficiency on the basis that such item was not partnership income. In  1955, after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessing  deficiencies with respect to 1950, the Tax Court sustained C's position.  The Commissioner may assess a deficiency against B with respect to 1950  requiring him to include the entire amount of such item in his income  since assessment of the deficiency was not barred when the Commissioner  sent the notice of deficiency with respect to such item to C.
