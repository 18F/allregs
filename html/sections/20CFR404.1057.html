                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)(i)</em> of the Act to reflect changes in wages in the economy.  Non-cash payments for domestic service are not counted as wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> How evaluation is made. We apply the applicable dollar threshold  described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section based on when the payments  are made to you rather than when the pay is earned. To count toward the  applicable dollar threshold, payment must be made to you in cash  (including checks or other forms of money). We apply the applicable  dollar threshold only to services performed as a domestic employee. If  an employer pays you for performing other work, the cash pay for the  nondomestic work does not count toward the applicable dollar threshold  domestic service pay required for the remuneration to count as wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> More than one domestic employer. The applicable dollar threshold  as explained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to each  employer when you perform domestic services for more than one employer  in a calendar year. The wages paid by more than one employer for  domestic services may not be combined to decide whether you have been  paid the applicable dollar threshold or more in a calendar year. The  standard applies to each employee when an employer has two or more  domestic employees during a calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rounding dollar amounts for reporting. For social security  purposes, an employer has an option in the way he or she reports cash  wages paid for domestic service in his or her private home. The employer  may report the actual wages paid or may round the   wages to the nearest dollar. For purposes of rounding to the nearest  dollar the cents are disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or  more, in which case it will be raised to $1. If an employer uses this  method to report a cash payment to you for domestic services in his or  her private home in a calendar year, he or she must use the same method  to report payments to other employees in that year for similar services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What is domestic service. Domestic service is work of a  household nature done by you in or about a private home of the employer.  A private home is a fixed place of residence of a person or family. A  separate dwelling unit maintained by a person in an apartment house,  hotel, or other similar establishment may be a private home. If a house  is used primarily for supplying board or lodging to the public as a  business enterprise, it is not a private home. In general, services of a  household nature in or about a private home include services performed  by cooks, waiters, butlers, housekeepers, governessess, maids, valets,  baby sitters, janitors, laundresses, furnacemen, caretakers, handymen,  gardeners, footmen, grooms, and chauffeurs of automobiles for family  use. Pay for these services does not come under this provision unless  the services are performed in or about a private home of the employer.  Pay for services not of a household nature, such as services performed  as a private secretary, tutor, or librarian, even though performed in  the employer's home, does not come under this provision.
