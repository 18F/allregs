                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of this section apply to small quantity  generators of more than 100 kg but less than 1,000 kg of hazardous waste  in a calendar month, that accumulate hazardous waste in tanks for less  than 180 days (or 270 days if the generator must ship the waste greater  than 200 miles), and do not accumulate over 6,000 kg on-site at any  time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo hazardous waste must  comply with the following general operating requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment or storage of hazardous waste in tanks must comply  with Sec. 265.17(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hazardous wastes or treatment reagents must not be placed in a  tank if they could cause the tank or its inner liner to rupture, leak,  corrode, or otherwise fail before the end of its intended life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Uncovered tanks must be operated to ensure at least 60  centimeters (2 feet) of freeboard, unless the tank is equipped with a  containment structure (e.g., dike or trench), a drainage control system,  or a diversion structure (e.g., standby tank) with a capacity that  equals or exceeds the volume of the top 60 centimeters (2 feet) of the  tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where hazardous waste is continuously fed into a tank, the tank  must be equipped with a means to stop this inflow (e.g., waste feed  cutoff system or by-pass system to a stand-by tank).</p><p class="depth3">Note: These systems are intended to be used in the event of a leak  or overflow from the tank due to a system failure (e.g., a malfunction  in the treatment process, a crack in the tank, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, generators who  accumulate between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo of hazardous waste in tanks must  inspect, where present:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discharge control equipment (e.g., waste feed cutoff systems,  by-pass systems, and drainage systems) at least once each operating day,  to ensure that it is in good working order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data gathered from monitoring equipment (e.g., pressure and  temperature gauges) at least once each operating day to ensure that the  tank is being operated according to its design;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The construction materials of the tank at least weekly to detect  corrosion or leaking of fixtures or seams; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The construction materials of, and the area immediately  surrounding, discharge confinement structures (e.g., dikes) at least  weekly to detect erosion or obvious signs of leakage (e.g., wet spots or  dead vegetation).</p><p class="depth3">Note: As required by Sec. 265.15(c), the owner or operator must  remedy any deterioration or malfunction he finds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Generators who accumulate between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo of  hazardous waste in tanks or tank systems that   have full secondary containment and that either use leak detection  equipment to alert facility personnel to leaks, or implement established  workplace practices to ensure leaks are promptly identified, must  inspect at least weekly, where applicable, the areas identified in  paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section. Use of the alternate  inspection schedule must be documented in the facility's operating  record. This documentation must include a description of the established  workplace practices at the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Performance Track member facilities may inspect on a less  frequent basis, upon approval by the Director, but must inspect at least  once each month. To apply for a less than weekly inspection frequency,  the Performance Track member facility must follow the procedures  described in Sec. 265.15(b)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Generators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo accumulating hazardous  waste in tanks must, upon closure of the facility, remove all hazardous  waste from tanks, discharge control equipment, and discharge confinement  structures.</p><p class="depth2">Note: At closure, as throughout the operating period, unless the  owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with Sec. 261.3(c) or  (d) of this chapter, that any solid waste removed from his tank is not a  hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous  waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements  of parts 262, 263, and 265 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Generators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo must comply with the  following special requirements for ignitable or reactive waste:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ignitable or reactive waste must not be placed in a tank,  unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The waste is treated, rendered, or mixed before or immediately  after placement in a tank so that (A) the resulting waste, mixture, or  dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or  reactive waste under Sec. 261.21 or Sec. 261.23 of this chapter, and (B)  Sec. 265.17(b) is complied with; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The waste is stored or treated in such a way that it is  protected from any material or conditions that may cause the waste to  ignite or react; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The tank is used solely for emergencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a facility which treats or stores  ignitable or reactive waste in covered tanks must comply with the buffer  zone requirements for tanks contained in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the  National Fire Protection Association's ``Flammable and Combustible  Liquids Code,'' (1977 or 1981) (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 260.11).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Generators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo must comply with the  following special requirements for incompatible wastes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials, (see  appendix V for examples) must not be placed in the same tank, unless  Sec. 265.17(b) is complied with.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed tank which  previously held an incompatible waste or material, unless Sec. 265.17(b)  is complied with.
