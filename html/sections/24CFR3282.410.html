A manufacturer that is required to correct a serious defect or imminent safety hazard pursuant to Sec. 3282.406(b) must complete implementation of the plan required by Sec. 3282.408 on or before the deadline approved by the SAA or the Secretary. The deadline must be no later than 60 days after approval of the plan. In approving the deadline, the SAA or the Secretary will allow a reasonable amount of time to complete the plan, taking into account the seriousness of the problem, the number of manufactured homes involved, the immediacy of any risk, and the difficulty of completing the action. The seriousness and immediacy of any risk posed by the serious defect or imminent safety hazard will be given greater weight than other considerations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extensions. An SAA that approved a plan or the Secretary may grant an extension of the deadlines included in a plan, if the manufacturer requests such an extension in writing and shows good cause for the extension, if the SAA or the Secretary decides that the extension is justified and not contrary to the public interest.

any corrections, the SAA must notify the Secretary and the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recordkeeping. The manufacturer must provide the report and maintain the records that are required by Sec. 3282.417 for all notification and correction actions.</p>
