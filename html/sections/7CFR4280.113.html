                            <p class="depth0">For a project to be eligible to receive a RES or EEI grant under  this subpart, the proposed project must meet each of the requirements  specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Be for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purchase of a new RES;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purchase of a Refurbished RES;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Retrofitting of an existing RES; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Making EEI that will use less energy on an annual basis than the  original building and/or equipment that it will improve or replace as  demonstrated in an Energy Assessment or Energy Audit as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Types of improvements. Eligible EEI include, but are not limited  to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Efficiency improvements to existing RES and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Construction of a new energy efficient building only when the  building is used for the same purpose as the existing building, and,  based on an Energy Assessment or Energy Audit, as applicable, it will be  more cost effective to construct a new building and will use less energy  on annual basis than improving the existing building.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subsequent Energy Efficiency Improvements. A proposed EEI that  replaces or duplicates an EEI previously funded under this subpart may  or may not be eligible for funding.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the proposed EEI would replace or duplicate the same EEI that  had previously received funds under this subpart prior to the end of the  useful life, as specified in the Grant Agreement, of that same EEI, then  the proposed improvement, even if it is more energy efficient than the  previously funded improvement, is ineligible. Example: An Applicant  received a REAP grant to replace an exhaust fan (exhaust fan A) in a  barn with a more energy efficient exhaust fan (exhaust fan B) with an  expected useful life of 15 years, as specified in the Grant Agreement.  If the Applicant decides to replace exhaust fan B after 8 years (i.e.,  before it has reached the end of its useful life as specified it the  Grant Agreement), an application for exhaust fan C to replace exhaust  fan B would be ineligible for funding under this subpart even if exhaust  fan C is more energy efficient than exhaust fan B.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the proposed EEI would replace or duplicate the same EEI that  had previously received funds under this subpart at or after the end of  the useful life, as specified in the Grant Agreement, of that same EEI,  then the proposed improvement is eligible for funding under this subpart  provided it is more energy efficient than the previously funded  improvement. If the proposed EEI is not more energy efficient than the  previously funded improvement, then it is not eligible for funding under  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Be for a Commercially Available technology;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Have technical merit, as determined using the procedures  specified in Sec. 4280.116; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Be located in a Rural Area in a State if the type of Applicant  is a Rural Small Business, or in a Rural or non-Rural Area in a State if  the type of Applicant is an Agricultural Producer. If the Agricultural  Producer's operation is in a non-Rural Area, then the application can  only be for RES or EEI on components that are directly related to and  their use and purpose is limited to the agricultural production  operation, such as vertically integrated operations, and are part of and  co-located with the agricultural production operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (3) of  this section is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installation of a second meter (or similar device) that results  in all of the energy generated by the RES being used for non-residential  energy usage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification is provided in the application that any excess  power generated by the RES will be sold to the grid and will not be used  by the Applicant for residential purposes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstration that 51 percent or greater of the energy to be  generated will benefit the Rural Small Business or agricultural  operation. The Applicant must provide documentation that includes, but  is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A Renewable Energy Site Assessment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of energy that is used by the residence and the  amount that is used by the Rural Small Business or agricultural  operation. Provide documentation, calculations, etc. to support the  breakout of energy amounts. The Agency may request additional data to  determine residential versus business operation usage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The actual percentage of energy determined to benefit the  Rural Small Business or agricultural operation will be the basis to  determine eligible project costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Applicant is cautioned against taking any actions or  incurring any obligations prior to the Agency completing the  environmental review that would either limit the range of alternatives  to be considered or that   would have an adverse effect on the environment, such as the initiation  of construction. If the Applicant takes any such actions or incurs any  such obligations, it could result in project ineligibility.</p>
