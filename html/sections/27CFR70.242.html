                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary or other income are exempt from levy. This section described the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 70.243 of this part describes the sum which will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's payroll periods. Payroll periods are described in Sec. 70.244 of this part. Amounts exempt from levy are determined in part by the number of persons claimed by the taxpayer as dependents. Section 70.245 of this part describes the manner in which the taxpayer is to claim any dependent exemptions and the manner in which the employer is to compute the exempt amount and pay the balance to the appropriate TTB officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible taxpayer income. Only wages, salary or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made on the payor may be exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334 (a)(9). No amount of wages, salary or other income which is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the payor will be so exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer--(1) From wages, salary or other income not subject to levy. In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary or other income, the appropriate TTB officer may elect to levy on only one or more such source while leaving other sources of salary or other income free from levy. If those wages, salary or other income which the appropriate TTB officer leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a)(9) and (d) and Sec. 70.243 of this part (and ar not otherwise exempt), then no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income on which the appropriate TTB officer elects to levy is exempt from levy. The appropriate TTB officer shall notify the employer or other person subject to levy that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income is exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From wages, salary or other income not subject to levy. In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary or other income, the appropriate TTB officer may elect to levy on only one or more such source while leaving other sources of salary or other income free from levy. If those wages, salary or other income which the appropriate TTB officer leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a)(9) and (d) and Sec. 70.243 of this part (and ar not otherwise exempt), then no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income on which the appropriate TTB officer elects to levy is exempt from levy. The appropriate TTB officer shall notify the employer or other person subject to levy that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income is exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From wages, salary or other income subject to levy. If the taxpayer's income upon which the appropriate TTB officer does not levy is less than that amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption, then an amount determined pursuant to Sec. 70.243 of this part is to be paid to the taxpayer from those wages, salary or other income which are subject to levy. The appropriate TTB officer will designate those wages, salary or other income subject to levy from which such amount will be paid to the taxpayer. The appropriate TTB officer will generally make this designation by delivering to the employer, or other person levied upon, the form upon which the taxpayer is to claim any dependent exemption. The form will acompany the notice of levy. The person receiving the form from the appropriate TTB officer must promptly deliver it to the taxpayer. In the case of some employers having a large number of employees, however, the appropriate TTB officer will send the form upon which an employee is to claim any dependent exemption diretly to the employee. In such a case, the notice of levy will indicate that the form for claiming dependent exemptions has been sent to the taxpayer. If a notice of levy is not accompanied by the form for claiming dependent exemptions and does not indicate that the form was sent directly to the taxpayer, then the person levied upon must make payment to the appropriate TTB officer without regard to amounts prescribed by Sec. 70.243 of this part as exempt from levy. If a notice of levy is accompanied by the form for claiming dependent exemptions or indicates that the form was sent directly to the taxpayer, then the person levied upon is to pay over to the taxpayer, amounts determined to be exempt from levy pursuant to Sec. 70.243 and Sec. 70.245 (b) and (c) of this part (relating to the requirement that the taxpayer submit a claim for any dependent exemption). Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with the terms of the levy.
