                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturers are liable for  in-use performance of their conversion systems as outlined in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We may conduct or require testing on any vehicles/engines as  allowed under the Clean Air Act. This may involve confirmatory testing,  in-use testing, and/or selective enforcement audits for clean  alternative fuel conversion systems. Dual-fuel vehicles/engines may be  tested when operating on any of the fuels. Mixed-fuel vehicles/engines  may be tested on any fuel blend ratio that is expected to occur during  normal operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for an application for certification, your actions to  document compliance and notify us under this subpart are not a request  for our approval. We generally do not give any formal approval short of  issuing a certificate of conformity. However, if we learn that your  actions fall short of full compliance with applicable requirements we  may notify you that you have not met applicable requirements or that we  need more information to make that determination. The exemption from the  tampering prohibition may be void ab initio if the conversion  manufacturer has not satisfied all of the applicable provisions of this  subpart even if a submission to EPA has been made and the conversion  system appears on EPA's publicly available list of compliant systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturers must accept in- use liability for warranty, are subject to defect reporting  requirements, and may be required to recall any parts or systems for  which the failure can be traced to the conversion, regardless of whether  installation was proper or improper. The OEM shall remain liable for the  performance of any parts or systems which retain their original   function following conversion and are unaffected by the conversion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturers must keep  sufficient records for five years from the date of notification or  certification, or the date of the last conversion installation,  whichever is later, to show that they meet applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturers must submit an  end of the year sales report to EPA describing the number of clean  alternative fuel conversions by fuel type(s) and vehicle test group/ engine family by January 31 of the following year. The number of  conversions is the sum of the calendar year intermediate age  conversions, outside useful life conversions, and the same conversion  model year certified clean alternative fuel conversions. The number of  conversions will be added to any other vehicle and engine sales  accounted for using 40 CFR 86.1838-01 or 40 CFR 86.098-14 as appropriate  to determine small volume manufacturer or qualified small volume test  group/engine family status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conversion manufacturers who market conversion systems for use  on vehicles/engines other than the test group/engine families and  evaporative/refueling families covered by the compliance demonstration  and notification may be liable for a tampering violation for each  vehicle/engine to which conversion system is misapplied.
