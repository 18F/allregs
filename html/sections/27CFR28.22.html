                            <p class="depth0">Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of Sec. 28.21 relating to vessels employed in the fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the district director of customs of a special written application by the withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the required TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, that the liquors are

to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel employed in the fisheries. The original application on customs Form 5125, after approval, shall be stamped with the serial number of the TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and the date thereof, and shall be returned by the district director of customs to the withdrawer or vessel's master for use as prescribed below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs port or station and that an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the disposition of the liquors until the district director of customs is satisfied that they have been consumed on board, or landed under customs supervision, and takes up the authorization. The approval of customs Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition that any such liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of the port or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors have been accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of customs, he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both copies of the TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and forward the original of the form according to its instructions. In the event of a failure on the part of the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with the conditions of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the liquors were not lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district director of customs shall advise the appropriate TTB officer of all the facts in the case for determination of any liability incurred. In the case of liquors withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of tax liability found to have been incurred shall be made against the principal on the bond. In the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, the appropriate TTB officer shall determine as to whether to make demand upon the principal and the surety on the bond or to disallow the claim as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0">Note: As used in this section, the word ``withdrawer'' shall mean the person executing the application or notice, TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be.
