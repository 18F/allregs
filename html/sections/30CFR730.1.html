                            <p class="depth0">This subchapter sets forth standards and procedures for the submission, review, and approval or disapproval of State programs, for coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Indian and non-Federal lands. In addition it sets forth criteria and procedures for amending approved programs, substituting Federal enforcement for State enforcement of State programs, and withdrawing approval of those programs not adequately implemented or maintained. Requirements are also included for State program grants and for the adoption of a Federal program in a State which does not have a State program or which has failed to implement, enforce or maintain an approved State program consistent with this subchapter.
