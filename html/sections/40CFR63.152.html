All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (g)(1)(iii)(C) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The running average is based on at least 6 1-hour average values; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The running average reflects a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other

alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(v)(A) through (g)(1)(v)(C) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Upon initial installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Annually after initial installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (g)(1)(vi) (A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in Sec. 63.103(c) of subpart F of this part, except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Owners and operators subject to paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(B) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after its creation. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring was required and/or approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next periodic report. The owner or

operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a startup, shutdown, or malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A) and (g)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with Sec. 63.102(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An excused excursion, as described in Sec. 63.152(c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C), shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2).
