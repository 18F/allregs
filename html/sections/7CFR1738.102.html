Non-contiguous areas are considered separate service areas and must be treated separately for the purpose of determining service area eligibility.

If an applicant fails to respond to Agency requests for additional information or modifications to remove ineligible areas, the application will be rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no existing broadband service provider responds to the Public Notice as described in Sec. 1738.204(b), then the number of incumbent service providers for Sec. 1738.102(a)(3) will be determined by using:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The most current National Broadband Map; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other data regarding the availability of broadband service that the Secretary may collect or obtain through reasonable efforts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a service provider is identified by methods described in paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the Agency is unable to determine whether such provider is an incumbent service provider, as defined herein, then the Agency will request the service provider to provide information responding to the Public Notice for the loan application, demonstrating that they meet the definition for an incumbent

service provider. If the service provider does not respond to the Agency's request within 30 calendar days providing the necessary information to make a determination, the provider will not be considered an incumbent service provider.</p>
