Section 9(f) establishes an  Operating Fund for the purposes of making assistance available to public  housing agencies (PHAs) for the operation and management of public  housing. In the case of unsubsidized housing, the total expenses of  operating rental housing should be covered by the operating income,  which primarily consists of rental income and, to some degree,  investment and non-rental income. In the case of public housing, the  Operating Fund provides operating subsidy to assist PHAs to serve low,  very low, and extremely low-income families. This part describes the  policies and procedures for Operating Fund formula calculations and  management under the Operating Fund Program.</p>
