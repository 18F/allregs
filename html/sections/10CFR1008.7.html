                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipt of a request made in accordance with Sec. 1008.6 shall  be promptly acknowledged by the Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each request shall be acted upon promptly. Every effort will be  made to respond within ten working days of the date of receipt by the  System Manager or designee. If a response cannot be made within ten  working days, the appropriate Privacy Act Officer shall send an interim  response providing information on the status of the request, including  an estimate of the time within which action is expected to be taken on  the request and asking for any further information as may be necessary  to respond to the request. Action will be completed as soon as possible,  but not later than 20 working days after receipt of the original  specific inquiry. In unusual circumstances and for good cause, the  appropriate Privacy Act Officer may decide that action cannot be  completed within the initial 20 working days. In such case, the  appropriate Privacy Act Officer will advise the individual of the reason  for the delay and the date (not to exceed an additional 20 working days)  by which action can be expected to be completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term unusual circumstances as used in this section includes  situations where a search for requested records from inactive storage is  necessary; cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved;  instances where information on other individuals must be separated or  expunged from the particular record; and cases where consultation with  other agencies which have substantial interest in the response to the  request is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon receiving a request, the Privacy Act Officer shall  ascertain which System Manager or Managers of the DOE have primary  responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the system or systems of  records subject to the request and shall forward the request to such  System Manager or Managers. The System Manager or Managers shall  promptly identify and, in consultation with the General Counsel, review  the records encompassed by the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where the request is for access to or information about records,  after reviewing the material the System Manager or Managers concerned  shall transmit to the Privacy Act Officer the requested material. The  transmission to the Privacy Act Officer shall include any recommendation  that the request be granted or wholly or partially denied and shall set  forth any exemption categories supporting denials. Any denial  recommendation must be concurred in by the appropriate General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where the request is for correction or amendment of records,  after reviewing the material the System Manager or Managers shall  transmit a recommended decision to the Privacy Act Officer. Any  recommendation that the request be granted or wholly or partially denied  shall cite the exemption relied on and set forth the policy  considerations supporting a denial. Any recommendation of denial must be  concurred in by General Counsel.</p>
