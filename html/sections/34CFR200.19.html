A State may, but is not required to, increase the goals  of its other academic indicators over the course of the timeline under  Sec. 200.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting. A State and its LEAs must report under section  1111(h) of the Act (annual report cards) performance on the academic  indicators for elementary and middle schools at the school, LEA, and  State levels in the aggregate and disaggregated by each subgroup  described in Sec. 200.13(b)(7)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determining AYP. A State--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Must disaggregate its other academic indicators for elementary  and middle schools by each subgroup described in Sec. 200.13(b)(7)(ii)  for purposes of determining AYP under Sec. 200.20(b)(2) (``safe  harbor'') and as required under section 1111(b)(2)(C)(vii) of the Act  (additional academic indicators under paragraph (c) of this section);  but (ii) Need not disaggregate those indicators for determining AYP  under Sec. 200.20(a)(1)(ii) (meeting the State's annual measurable  objectives).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> High schools--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Graduation rate. Consistent with paragraphs  (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section regarding reporting and determining  AYP, respectively, each State must calculate a graduation rate, defined  as follows, for all public high schools in the State:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A State must calculate a ``four-year adjusted cohort  graduation rate,'' defined as the number of students who graduate in  four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of  students who form the adjusted cohort for that graduating class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For those high schools that start after grade nine, the cohort  must be calculated based on the earliest high school grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``adjusted cohort'' means the students who enter grade  9 (or the earliest high school grade) and any students who transfer into  the cohort in grades 9 through 12 minus any students removed from the  cohort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The term ``students who transfer into the cohort'' means the  students who enroll after the beginning of the entering cohort's first  year in high school, up to and including in grade 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To remove a student from the cohort, a school or LEA must  confirm in writing that the student transferred out, emigrated to  another country, or is deceased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To confirm that a student transferred out, the school or LEA  must have official written documentation   that the student enrolled in another school or in an educational program  that culminates in the award of a regular high school diploma.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A student who is retained in grade, enrolls in a General  Educational Development (GED) program, or leaves school for any other  reason may not be counted as having transferred out for the purpose of  calculating graduation rate and must remain in the adjusted cohort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term ``students who graduate in four years'' means  students who earn a regular high school diploma at the conclusion of  their fourth year, before the conclusion of their fourth year, or during  a summer session immediately following their fourth year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The term ``regular high school diploma'' means the standard  high school diploma that is awarded to students in the State and that is  fully aligned with the State's academic content standards or a higher  diploma and does not include a GED credential, certificate of  attendance, or any alternative award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In addition to calculating a four-year adjusted cohort  graduation rate, a State may propose to the Secretary for approval an  ``extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is defined as  the number of students who graduate in four years or more with a regular  high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the  adjusted cohort for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate,  provided that the adjustments account for any students who transfer into  the cohort by the end of the year of graduation being considered minus  the number of students who transfer out, emigrate to another country, or  are deceased by the end of that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A State may calculate one or more extended-year adjusted cohort  graduation rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transitional graduation rate. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the deadline in  paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, a State must calculate  graduation rate as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or use,  on a transitional basis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A graduation rate that measures the percentage of students from  the beginning of high school who graduate with a regular high school  diploma in the standard number of years;
