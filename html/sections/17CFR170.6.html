These rules governing such disciplinary actions shall contain, at a minimum, the procedural safeguards contained in section 17(b)(9) of the Act. In addition, an association, in disciplining its members should demonstrate that it will:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Take vigorous action against those who engage in activities in violation of association rules;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conduct proceedings in a manner consistent with the fundamental elements of due process; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impose discipline which is fair and has a reasonable basis in fact.
