A catalog or other multipage advertisement, or an  electronic advertisement   (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site), that  provides a table or schedule of the required disclosures shall be  considered a single advertisement if, for lease terms that appear  without all the required disclosures, the advertisement refers to the  page or pages on which the table or schedule appears.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Triggering terms.
