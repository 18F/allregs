                                Sec. 780.115  Forest products.

                            <p class="depth0">Trees grown in forests and the lumber derived therefrom are not  ``agricultural or horticultural commodities.'' Christmas trees, whether  wild or planted, are also not so considered. It follows that employment  in the production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of such trees or  timber products is not sufficient to bring an employee within section  3(f) unless the operation is performed by a farmer or on a farm as an  incident to or in conjunction with his or its farming operations. On the  latter point, see Sec. Sec. 780.160 through 780.164 which discuss the  question of when forestry or lumbering operations are incident to or in  conjunction with farming operations so as to constitute ``agriculture.''  For a discussion of the exemption in section 13(a)(13) of the Act for  certain forestry   and logging operations in which not more than eight employees are  employed, see part 788 of this chapter.
