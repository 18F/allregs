                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If HUD finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing  that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision  of NAHASDA or the regulations in this part, HUD shall carry out any of  the following actions with respect to the recipient's current or future  grants, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Terminate payments under NAHASDA to the recipient;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduce payments under NAHASDA to the recipient by an amount  equal to the amount of such payments that were not expended in  accordance with NAHASDA or these regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limit the availability of payments under NAHASDA to programs,  projects, or activities not affected by the failure to comply; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of noncompliance described in Sec. 1000.542,  provide a replacement TDHE for the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Before undertaking any action in accordance with paragraph (a)  of this section, HUD will notify the recipient in writing of the action  it intends to take and provide the recipient an opportunity for an  informal meeting to resolve the deficiency. Before taking any action  under paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall provide the recipient  with the opportunity for a hearing no less than 30 days prior to taking  the proposed action. The hearing shall be held in accordance with Sec.  1000.540. The amount in question shall not be reallocated under the  provisions of Sec. 1000.536, until 15 days after the hearing has been   conducted and HUD has rendered a final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if HUD  makes a determination that the failure of a recipient to comply  substantially with any material provision of NAHASDA or these  regulations is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing  expenditure of funds provided under NAHASDA in a manner that is not  authorized by law, HUD may, in accordance with section 401(a)(4) of  NAHASDA, take action under paragraph (a)(3) of this section prior to  conducting a hearing under paragraph (b) of this section. HUD shall  provide notice to the recipient at the time that HUD takes that action  and conducts a hearing, in accordance with section 401(a)(4)(B) of  NAHASDA, within 60 days of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if HUD determines  that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of NAHASDA  or these regulations is not a pattern or practice of activities  constituting willful noncompliance, and is a result of the limited  capability or capacity of the recipient, if the recipient requests, HUD  shall provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or  indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability or capacity of  the recipient to administer assistance under NAHASDA in compliance with  the requirements under NAHASDA. A recipient's eligibility for technical  assistance under this subsection is contingent on the recipient's  execution of, and compliance with, a performance agreement pursuant to  Section 401(b) of NAHASDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of, or in addition to, any action described in this  section, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient has  failed to comply substantially with any provisions of NAHASDA or these  regulations, HUD may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the  United States, with a recommendation that appropriate civil action be  instituted.
