Special  interpretive and educational awards may be awarded under this subpart to  only those designated Reserves with approved final management plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Funds provided under this subpart may be available on a  competitive basis to any state agency. However, if the applicant is  other than the managing entity of a Reserve, that applicant must submit  as a part of the application a letter from the Reserve manager  indicating formal support of the application by the managing entity of  the Reserve. These funds are provided in addition to any other funds  available to a coastal state under the Act. Federal funds provided under  this subpart may not exceed 70 percent of the total cost of the project,  consistent with Sec. 921.81(e)(4) (``allowable costs''),   except when the financial assistance is provided from amounts recovered  as a result of damage to natural resources located in the coastal zone,  in which case the assistance may be used to pay 100 percent of the  costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicants for education/interpretive projects that NOAA  determines benefit the entire National Estuarine Research Reserve System  may receive Federal assistance of up to 100% of project costs.
