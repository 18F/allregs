In addition, a community volunteer must have served prior to October 1, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time limit.

(For Community volunteers who have completed their service before March 10, 1978, the 1-year period begins on March 10, 1978.) However, an agency may extend the period for 2 more years to a total of 3 years if the person, after the qualifying service, is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the military service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Studying at a recognized institution of higher learning; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In another activity which, in the agency's view, warrants extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conditions.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a person appointed under paragraph (a) of this section becomes a career-conditional employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person appointed under paragraph (a) or this section becomes a career employee if excepted from the service requirement for career tenure by Sec. 315.201(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acquisition of competitive status. A person appointed under paragraph (a) of this section acquires a competitive status automatically on completion of probation.
