                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. A cylinder filled with a liquefied compressed gas (except gas in solution) must be offered for transportation in accordance with the requirements of this section and the general requirements in Sec. 173.301. In addition, a DOT specification cylinder must meet the requirement in Secs. 173.301a, 173.304a, and 173.305, as applicable. UN pressure receptacles must be shipped in accordance with the requirements in 173.301b and 173.304b, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A DOT 3AL cylinder may not be used for any material with a primary or subsidiary hazard of Class 8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Shipments of Division 2.1 materials in aluminum cylinders are authorized only when transported by motor vehicle, rail car, or cargo-only aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filling limits. Except for carbon dioxide; 1,1-Difluoroethylene (R-1132A); nitrous oxide; and vinyl fluoride, inhibited, the liquid portion of a liquefied gas may not completely fill the packaging at any temperature up to and including 55 C (131 F). The liquid portion of vinyl fluoride, inhibited, may completely fill the cylinder at 55 C (131 F) provided the pressure at the critical temperature does not exceed 1.25 times the service pressure of the cylinder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mixture of compressed gas and other material. A mixture of compressed gas must be shipped in accordance with Sec. 173.305.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Refrigerant and dispersant gases. Nontoxic and nonflammable refrigerant or dispersant gases must be offered for transportation in cylinders prescribed in Sec. 173.304a, or in DOT 2P and 2Q containers (Secs. 178.33, 178.33a of this subchapter). DOT 2P and 2Q containers must be packaged in a strong

wooden or fiberboard box of such design as to protect valves from damage or accidental functioning under conditions incident to transportation. Pressure in the inside metal containers may not exceed 87 psia at 21 C (70 F). Each completed metal container filled for shipment must be heated until its contents reach a minimum temperature of 55 C (131 F) without evidence of leakage, distortion, or other defect. Each outside package must be plainly marked ``INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED SPECIFICATIONS''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Engine starting fluid. Engine starting fluid containing a flammable compressed gas or gases must be shipped in a cylinder as prescribed in Sec. 173.304a or as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inside non-refillable metal containers having a capacity not greater than 500 mL (32 in \3\). The containers must be packaged in strong, tight outer packagings. The pressure in the container may not exceed 145 psia at 54 C (130 F). If the pressure exceeds 145 psia at 54 C (130 F), a DOT 2P container must be used. In either case, the metal container must be capable of withstanding, without bursting, a pressure of 1.5 times the pressure of the contents at 54 C (130 F). The liquid content of the material and gas may not completely fill the container at 54 C (130 F). Each container filled for shipment must have been heated until its contents reach a minimum temperature of 54 C (130 F), without evidence of leakage, distortion, or other defect. Each outside shipping container must be plainly marked, ``INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED SPECIFICATIONS''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Oxidizing gases by aircraft.

The additional marking ``DOT31FP,'' is allowed to indicate that the cylinder and the outer packaging are capable of passing, as demonstrated by design testing, the Thermal Resistance Test specified in

appendix D to part 178 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A cylinder of compressed oxygen that has been furnished by an aircraft operator to a passenger in accordance with 14 CFR 121.574, 125.219, or 135.91 is excepted from the outer packaging requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

Sec. 173.304b  Additional requirements for shipment of liquefiedcompressed gases in UN pressure receptacles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Liquefied gases and gas mixtures must be offered for transportation in UN pressure receptacles subject to the requirements in this section and Sec. 173.304. In addition, the general requirements applicable to UN pressure receptacles in Secs. 173.301 and 173.301b must be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> UN pressure receptacle filling limits. A UN pressure receptacle is authorized for the transportation of liquefied compressed gases and gas mixtures as specified in this section. When a liquefied compressed gas or gas mixture is transported in a UN pressure receptacle, the filling ratio may not exceed the maximum filling ratio prescribed in this section and the applicable ISO standard. Compliance with the filling limits may be determined by referencing the numerical values and data in Table 2 of P200 of the UN Recommendations (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Alternatively, the maximum allowable filling limits may be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For high pressure liquefied gases, in no case may the filling ratio of the settled pressure at 65 C (149 F) exceed the test pressure of the UN pressure receptacle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For low pressure liquefied gases, the filling factor (maximum mass of contents per liter of water capacity) must be less than or equal to 95 percent of the liquid phase at 50 C.

The test pressure of the pressure receptacle must be equal to or greater than the vapor pressure of the liquid at 65 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For high pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio may be determined using the formulas in (3)(b) of P200 of the UN Recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For low pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio may be determined using the formulas in (3)(c) of P200 of the UN Recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tetraflouroethylene, stabilized, UN1081 must be packaged in a pressure receptacle with a minimum test pressure of 200 bar and a working pressure not exceeding 5 bar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fertilizer ammoniating solution with free ammonia, UN1043 is not authorized in UN tubes or MEGCs.
