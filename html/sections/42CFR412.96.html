                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for classification as a referral center: Basic rule.  CMS classifies a hospital as a referral center only if the hospital is a  Medicare participating acute care hospital and meets the applicable  criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for cost reporting periods beginning on or after  October 1, 1983. The hospital meets either of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hospital is located in a rural area (as defined in subpart D  of this part) and has the following number of beds, as determined under  the provisions of Sec. 412.105(b) available for use:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Effective for discharges occurring before April 1, 1988, the  hospital has 500 or more beds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988,  the hospital has 275 or more beds during its most recently completed  cost reporting period unless the hospital submits written documentation  with its application that its bed count has changed since the close of  its most recently completed cost reporting period for one or more of the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Merger of two or more hospitals.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reopening of acute care beds previously closed for renovation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Transfer to the prospective payment system of acute care beds  previously classified as part of an excluded unit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Expansion of acute care beds available for use and permanently  maintained for lodging inpatients, excluding beds in corridors and other  temporary beds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hospital shows that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 50 percent of its Medicare  patients are referred from other hospitals or from physicians not on the  staff of the hospital; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 60 percent of the hospital's Medicare patients live  more than 25 miles from the hospital, and at least 60 percent of all the  services that the hospital furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries are  furnished to beneficiaries who live more than 25 miles from the  hospital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(5)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Case-mix index. CMS sets forth national and regional case-mix  index values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates  published under Sec. 412.8(b). The methodology CMS uses to calculate  these criteria is described in paragraph (h) of this section. The case- mix index value to be used for an individual hospital in the  determination of whether it meets the case-mix index criteria is that  calculated by CMS from the hospital's own billing records for Medicare  discharges as processed by the fiscal intermediary and submitted to CMS.  The hospital's case-mix index for discharges (not including discharges  from units excluded from the prospective payment system under subpart B  of this part) during the most recent Federal fiscal year that ended at  least one year prior to the beginning of the cost reporting period for  which the hospital is seeking referral center status must be at least  equal to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost  reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before  October 1, 1986, the national or regional case-mix index value; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for  cost--reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, the  national case-mix index value as established by CMS or the median case- mix index value for urban hospitals located in each region. In  calculating the median case-mix index for each region, CMS excludes the  case-mix indexes of hospitals receiving indirect medical education  payments as provided in Sec. 412.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section for an osteopathic hospital, for the  hospital's cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year  as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median  discharges under paragraph </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, its number of discharges  (not including discharges from units excluded from the prospective  payments system under subpart B of this part or from newborn units) is  at least equal to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost  reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before  October 1, 1986, the number of discharges under either the national or  regional criterion; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost  reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, 5,000  discharges or, if less, the median number of discharges for urban  hospitals located in each region.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,  1986, an osteopathic hospital, recognized by the American Osteopathic  Healthcare Association (or any successor organization), that is located  in a rural area must have at least 3,000 discharges during its cost  reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost   reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under  paragraph (i) of this section to meet the number of discharges  criterion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Medical staff. More than 50 percent of the hospital's active  medical staff are specialists who meet one of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are certified as specialists by one of the Member Boards of the  American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of  Osteopathic Specialists.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have completed the current training requirements for admission  to the certification examination of one of the Member Boards of the  American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of  Osteopathic Specialists.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Have successfully completed a residency program in a medical  specialty accredited by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical  Education or the American Osteopathic Association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Source of inpatients. At least 60 percent of all its discharges  are for inpatients who reside more than 25 miles from the hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Volume of referrals. At least 40 percent of all inpatients  treated at the hospital are referred from other hospitals or from  physicians not on the hospital's staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment to rural referral centers. Effective for discharges  occurring on or after April 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1994, a  hospital that is located in a rural area and meets the criteria of  paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (c) of this section is paid prospective  payments for inpatient operating costs per discharge based on the  applicable other urban payment rates as determined in accordance with  Sec. 412.63, as adjusted by the hospital's area wage index.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)-(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Hospital cancellation of referral center status. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A hospital  may at any time request cancellation of its status as a referral center  and be paid prospective payments per discharge based on the applicable  rural rate, as determined in accordance with subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cancellation becomes effective no later than 30 days after  the date the hospital submits its request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a hospital requests that its referral center status be  canceled, it may not be reclassified as a referral center unless it  meets the qualifying criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section  in effect at the time it reapplies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> applies to hospitals that qualify as  rural referral centers under Sec. 412.96 based on rural status acquired  under Sec. 412.103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Updating process. CMS updates the national and regional case-mix  index standards using the latest available data from hospitals subject  to the prospective payment system for the Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Source of data. In making the calculations described in  paragraph (h)(1) of this section, CMS uses all inpatient hospital bills  received for discharges subject to prospective payment during the  Federal fiscal year being monitored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date. CMS sets forth the national and regional  criteria in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published  under Sec. 412.8(b). These criteria are used to determine if a hospital  qualifies for referral center status for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1 of the Federal fiscal year to which the  notice applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Methodology for calculating number of discharges criteria. For  purposes of determining compliance with the national or regional number  of discharges criterion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CMS  calculates the criteria as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Updating process. CMS updates the national and regional number  of discharges using the latest available data for levels of admissions  or discharges or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Source of data. In making the calculations described in  paragraph (i)(1)   of this section, CMS uses the most recent hospital admissions or  discharge data available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual notice. CMS sets forth the national and regional criteria  in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published under Sec.  412.8(b). These criteria are compared to an applying hospital's number  of discharges for the same cost reporting period used to develop the  regional criteria in this section in determining if the hospital  qualifies for referral center status for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1 of the Federal fiscal year to which the  notice applies.
