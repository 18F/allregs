Supplement No. 2 to Part 730--Technical Advisory Committees</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this supplement is to describe the  procedures and criteria for the establishment and operation of Technical  Advisory Committees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(4)</em> of this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form and substance of requests. Each request for the appointment  of a TAC shall be submitted in writing to: Assistant Secretary for  Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room  2099B, Washington, DC 20230.</p><p class="depth0">The request shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the articles, materials, or supplies including  technology and software, in terms of a clear, cohesive grouping (citing  the applicable Export Control Classification Numbers where practical);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the reasons for requesting the appointment of a  TAC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any information in support of any contention that may be made  that the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of  this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consideration of request for establishment of a TAC. The  Department of Commerce will review all requests for the establishment of  a TAC to determine if the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That a substantial segment of the industry producing the  specified articles, materials, or supplies including technology desires  such a committee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the evaluation of such articles, materials, or supplies  including technology and software for export control purposes is  difficult because of questions involving technical matters, worldwide  availability and actual utilization of production and software  technology, or licensing procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requests by a substantial segment of an industry. In determining  whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has requested the  appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment of a  TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and technology in  relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such items; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of  each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production.  Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of this  supplement) shall consist of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S. producers  of the items concerned; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of not  less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar  value of the items concerned; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S. producers  of the items concerned, provided that the total of their annual  production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total U.S. annual  production, by dollar value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If it is determined that a substantial segment of the industry  concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC concerning a specific  grouping of items that the Department of Commerce determines difficult  to evaluate for export control purposes, BIS will establish and use the  TAC requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requests from trade associations or other representatives.  Requests from trade associations or other representatives of U.S.  producers for the establishment of a TAC must comply with the provisions  of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this supplement. In addition, in  order to assist BIS in determining whether the criteria described in  paragraph (b)(3) of this supplement have been met, a trade association  or other representative submitting a request for the establishment of a  TAC should include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total number of firms in the particular industry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total number of firms in the industry that have authorized  the trade association or other representative to act in their behalf in  this matter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The approximate amount of total U.S. annual production by  dollar value of the items concerned produced by those firms that have  authorized the trade association or other representative to act in their  behalf; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of the method by which authorization to act on  behalf of these producers was obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nominations for membership on TACs. When the Department of  Commerce determines that the establishment of a TAC is warranted, it  will request nominations for membership on the committee among the  producers of the items and from any other sources that may be able to  suggest well-qualified nominees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Selection of industry members of committee. Industry members of  a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from a list of the  nominees who have indicated their availability for service on the  committee. To the extent feasible, the Department of Commerce will  select a committee balanced to represent all significant facets of the  industry involved, taking into consideration such factors as the size of  the firms, their geographical distribution, and their product lines. No  industry representative shall serve on a TAC for more than four  consecutive years. The membership of a member who is absent from four  consecutive meetings shall be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Government members. Government members of a TAC will be selected  by the Department of Commerce from the agencies having an interest in  the subject matter concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Invitation to serve on committee. Invitations to serve on a TAC  will be sent by letter to the selected nominees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Election of Chair. The Chair of each TAC shall be elected by a  vote of the majority of the members of the committee present and voting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Charter. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No TAC established pursuant to this supplement  shall meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter has  been filed with the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration of the  Department of Commerce and with the standing committees of the Senate  and of the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over  the Department. Such charter shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The committee's official designation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out  its purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The agency or official to whom the committee reports;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The agency responsible for providing the necessary support for  the committee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A description of the duties for which the committee is  responsible, and, if such duties are not solely advisory, a  specification of the authority for such functions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and years for  such committee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The committee's termination date, if less than two years from  the date of the committee's establishment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The date the charter is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Meetings. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each TAC established under the provisions of the  EAA and paragraph (b) of this supplement shall meet at least once every  three months at the call of its Chair unless it is specifically  determined by the Chair, in consultation with other members of the  committee, that a particular meeting is not necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No TAC may meet except at the call of its Chair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each meeting of a TAC shall be conducted in accordance with an  agenda approved by a designated Federal government employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No TAC shall conduct a meeting in the absence of a designated  Federal government employee who shall be authorized to adjourn any  advisory committee meeting, whenever the Federal government employee  determines adjournment to be in the public interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Public notice. Notice to the public of each meeting of a TAC  will be issued at least 20 days in advance and will be published in the  Federal Register. The notice will include the time and place of the  meeting and the agenda.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Public attendance and participation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any member of the  public who wishes to do so may file a written statement with any TAC  before or after any meeting of a committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A request for an opportunity to deliver an oral statement  relevant to matters on the agenda of a meeting of a TAC will be granted  to the extent that the time available for the meeting permits. A  committee may establish procedures requiring such persons to obtain  advance approval for such participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Attendance at meetings of TACs will be open to the public unless  it is determined pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory  Committee Act to be necessary to close all, or some portion, of the  meeting to the public. A determination that a meeting or portion thereof  be closed to the public may be made if all or a specific portion of a  meeting of a TAC is concerned with matters described in section 552(b)  of Title 5, U.S.C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Participation by members of the public in open TAC meetings or  questioning of committee members or other participants shall not be  permitted except in accordance with procedures established by the  committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Every effort will be made to accommodate all members of the  public who wish to attend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Minutes. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Detailed minutes of each meeting of each TAC will  be kept and will contain a record of the persons present, a complete and  accurate description of the matters discussed and conclusions reached,  and copies of all reports received, issued, or approved by the TAC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The accuracy of all the minutes will be certified to by the TAC  Chair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to section 552 of Title 5, U.S.C. and  Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, ``Public  Information,'' and ``Public Information'' regulations issued by the  Department of Commerce that are contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A,  the records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendices, working papers,  draft, studies, agenda, or other documents that were made available to  or prepared for or by each TAC will be available for public inspection  and copying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each TAC will prepare once each year a report describing its  membership, functions, activities, and such related matters as would be  informative to the public consistent with the policy of section 552(b)  of Title 5, U.S.C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requests for records should be addressed to: Bureau of  Industry and Security, Freedom of Information, Records Inspection  Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 4513, Washington, DC 20230,  Telephone (202) 482-2593.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules concerning the use of the Records Inspection Facility are  contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A, or may be obtained from this  facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compensation. If the Department of Commerce deems it  appropriate, a member of a TAC may be reimbursed for travel,  subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in connection with  the member's duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Scope of advisory committee functions. All TACs are limited to  the functions described in their charters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Duration of committees. Each TAC will terminate at the end of  two years from the date the committee was established or two years from  the effective date of its most recent extension, whichever is later.  Committees may be continued only for successive two-year periods by  appropriate action taken by the authorized officer of the Department of  Commerce prior to the date on which such advisory committee would  otherwise terminate. TACs may be extended or terminated only after  consultation with the committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Miscellaneous. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> TACs established in accordance with paragraph  (b) of this supplement must conform to the provisions of the Federal  Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), Office of Management and Budget  Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee  Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12,  ``Public Information,'' the applicable provisions of the EAA, and any  other applicable Department of Commerce regulations or procedures  affecting the establishment or operation of advisory committees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whenever the Department of Commerce desires the advice or  assistance of a particular segment of an industry with respect to any  export control problem for which the service of a TAC, as described in  paragraph (b) of this supplement is either unavailable or impracticable,  an advisory committee may be established pursuant to the provisions of  section 9 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Such committees will be  subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, OMB  Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee  Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12,  ``Public Information,'' and any other applicable Department of Commerce  regulations or procedures affecting the establishment or operation of  advisory committees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in the provisions of this supplement shall be construed  to restrict in any manner the right of any person or firm to discuss any  export control matter with the Department of Commerce or to offer advice  or information on export control matters.
