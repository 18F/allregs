                            <p class="depth0">You may assign or transfer your site license in whole or in part. Send BLM your completed and signed transfer application and the filing fee for assignment or transfer of site license found in the fee schedule in Sec. 3000.12 of this chapter. Your application must include a written statement that the transferee will comply with all license terms and conditions, and that the lessee accepts the transfer. The transferee must submit a bond meeting the requirements of Sec. 3273.19. The transfer is not effective until we approve the bond and site license transfer.
