                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part. This section describes when these interim provisions expire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Family banking. This paragraph (a) allows you to reduce the number of engines subject to the Tier 2 standards by certifying some of your engines earlier than otherwise required, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For early-compliant engines to generate offsets under this paragraph (a), you must meet the following general provisions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must begin actual production of early-compliant engines by September 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engines you produce after December 31, 2006 may not generate offsets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Offset-generating engines must be certified to the Tier 2 standards and requirements under this part 1048.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If you certify engines under the voluntary standards of Sec.  1048.140, you may not use them in your calculation under this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For every offset-generating engine certified to the Tier 2 standards, you may reduce the number of engines with the same maximum engine power that are required to meet the Tier 2 standards in later model years by one engine. You may calculate power-weighted offsets based on actual U.S.-directed sales volumes. For example, if you produce a total of 1,000 engines in 2005 and 2006 with an average maximum power of 60 kW certified to the Tier 2 standards, you may delay certification to that tier of standards for up to 60,000 kW-engine-years in any of the following ways:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Delay certification of up to 600 engines with an average maximum power of 100 kW for one model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Delay certification of up to 200 engines with an average maximum power of 100 kW for three consecutive model years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Delay certification of up to 400 engines with an average maximum power of 100 kW for one model year and up to 50 engines with an average maximum power of 200 kW for two model years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offset-using engines (that is, those not required to certify to the Tier 2 standards) must be certified to the Tier 1 standards and requirements of this part 1048. You may delay compliance for up to three model years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By January 31 of each year in which you use the provisions of this paragraph (a), send us a report describing how many offset-generating or offset-using engines you produced in the preceding model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hydrocarbon standards. For 2004 through 2006 model years, engine manufacturers may use nonmethane hydrocarbon measurements to demonstrate compliance with applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tier 1 deterioration factors. For Tier 1 engines, base the deterioration factor from Sec.  1048.240 on 3500 hours of

operation. We may assign a deterioration factor for a Tier 1 engine family, but this would not affect your need to meet all emission standards that apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Optional early field testing. You may optionally use the field-testing procedures in subpart F of this part for any in-use testing required under subpart E of this part to show that you meet Tier 1 standards. In this case, the same Tier 1 in-use emission standards apply to both steady-state testing in the laboratory and field testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Small-volume provisions. If you qualify for the hardship provisions in Sec.  1068.250 of this chapter, we may approve extensions of up to four years total.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> 2004 certification. For the 2004 model year, you may choose to have the emission standards and other requirements that apply to these engines in California serve as the emission standards and other requirements applicable under this part, instead of those in subpart A of this part. To ask for a certificate under this paragraph (h), send us the application for certification that you prepare for the California Air Resources Board instead of the information we otherwise require in Sec.  1048.205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Recreational vehicles. Engines or vehicles identified in the scope of 40 CFR part 1051 that are not yet regulated under that part are excluded from the requirements of this part. For example, snowmobiles produced in 2004 are not subject to the emission standards in this part. Once emission standards apply to these engines and vehicles, they are excluded from the requirements of this part under Sec.  1048.5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Delayed compliance with labeling requirements. Before the 2010 model year, you may omit the dates of manufacture from the emission control information label as specified in Sec.  1048.135(c)(5) if you keep those records and provide them to us upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Delayed compliance with fuel tank permeation requirements. Before the 2010 model year, you may omit the permeation-related requirements related to plastic fuel tanks in Sec.  1048.245(e)(1)(i) and Sec.  1048.501(e).
