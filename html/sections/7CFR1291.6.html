If steps were not taken to conduct outreach to these groups, provide a justification for why not. Provide a description of the affirmative steps taken to conduct a competitive grant process. Include the steps taken to conduct outreach to specialty crop stakeholders to receive and consider public comment to identify their priority needs in enhancing the competiveness of specialty crops. Identify the methods used to solicit proposals that meet specialty crop stakeholders' needs, including any focus on multi-state projects. Include a description of the process used to review proposals in a fair and equitable manner. State departments of agriculture may also provide a copy of the issued request for proposals. If a competitive grant process was not used, provide a justification why not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Project title and abstract. Include the title of the project and an abstract of 200 or fewer words for each project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Project purpose. For each project, clearly state the purpose of the project.

For each project, include a performance-monitoring plan to describe the process of collecting and analyzing data to meet the outcome-oriented objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Work plan. For each project, explain briefly the activities that will be performed to accomplish the objectives of the project. Be clear about who will do the work. Include appropriate time lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Budget narrative.
