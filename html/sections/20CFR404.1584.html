                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If you are blind (as explained in Sec. 404.1581), we will consider the earnings from the work you are doing to determine whether or not you should be paid cash benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under Age 55. If you are under age 55, we will evaluate the work you are doing using the guides in paragraph (d) of this section to determine whether or not your work shows that you are doing substantial gainful activity. If you are not doing substantial gainful activity, we will pay you cash benefits. If you are doing substantial gainful activity, we will not pay you cash benefits. However, you will be given a period of disability as described in subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Age 55 or older. If you are age 55 or older, we will evaluate your work using the guides in paragraph (d) of this section to determine whether or not your work shows that you are doing substantial gainful activity. If you have not shown this ability, we will pay you cash benefits. If you have shown an ability to do substantial gainful activity, we will evaluate your work activity to find out how your work compares with the work you did before. If the skills and abilities of your new work are about the same as those you used in the work you did before, we will not pay you cash benefits. However, if your new work requires skills and abilities which are less than or different than those you used in the work you did before, we will pay you cash benefits, but not for any month in which you actually perform substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation of earnings--(1) Earnings that will ordinarily show that you

have engaged in substantial gainful activity. We will ordinarily consider that your earnings from your work activities show that you have engaged in substantial gainful activity if your monthly earnings average more than the amount(s) shown in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. We will apply Secs. 404.1574(a)(2), 404.1575(c), and 404.1576 in determining the amount of your average earnings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Earnings that will ordinarily show that you

have engaged in substantial gainful activity. We will ordinarily consider that your earnings from your work activities show that you have engaged in substantial gainful activity if your monthly earnings average more than the amount(s) shown in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. We will apply Secs. 404.1574(a)(2), 404.1575(c), and 404.1576 in determining the amount of your average earnings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantial gainful activity guidelines for taxable years before 1978. For work activity performed in taxable years before 1978, the average earnings per month that we ordinarily consider enough to show that you have done substantial gainful activity are the same for blind people as for others. See Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) for the earnings guidelines for other than blind individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substantial gainful activity guidelines for taxable years beginning 1978. For taxable years beginning 1978, if you are blind, the law provides different earnings guidelines for determining if your earnings from your work activities are substantial gainful activity. Ordinarily, we consider your work to be substantial gainful activity, if your average monthly earnings are more than those shown in Table I. For years after 1977 and before 1996, increases in the substantial gainful activity guideline were linked to increases in the monthly exempt amount under the retirement earnings test for individuals aged 65 to 69. Beginning with 1996, increases in the substantial gainful activity amount have depended only on increases in the national average wage index.</p><p class="depth3">Table I------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Over                              In year(s)------------------------------------------------------------------------$334........................................................        1978$375........................................................        1979$417........................................................        1980$459........................................................        1981$500........................................................        1982$550........................................................        1983$580........................................................        1984$610........................................................        1985$650........................................................        1986$680........................................................        1987$700........................................................        1988$740........................................................        1989$780........................................................        1990$810........................................................        1991$850........................................................        1992$880........................................................        1993$930........................................................        1994$940........................................................        1995$960........................................................        1996$1,000......................................................        1997$1,050......................................................        1998$1,110......................................................        1999$1,170......................................................        2000------------------------------------------------------------------------
