Requests for amendment will  be considered only under the provisions of this regulation. Requests to  amend USACIDC reports will be granted only if the individual submits  new, relevant and material facts that are determined to warrant their  inclusion in or revision of the ROI. The burden of proof is on the  individual to substantiate the request. Requests to delete a person's  name from the title block will be granted only if it is determined that  there is not probable cause to believe that the individual committed the  offense for which he or she is listed as a subject. It is emphasized  that the decision to list a person's name in the title   block of a USACIDC report of investigation is an investigative  determination that is independent of whether or not subsequent judicial,  nonjudicial or administrative action is taken against the individual.  Within these parameters, any changes in the ROI rest within the sole  discretion of the Commanding General. USACIDC, whose decision will  constitute final action on behalf of the Secretary of the Army with  respect to this regulation.</p>
