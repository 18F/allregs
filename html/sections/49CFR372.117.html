Upon its own motion or  upon petition filed by any interested person, the Secretary may in an  appropriate proceeding, determine whether the area within which the  transportation by motor vehicle of passengers having an immediately  prior or subsequent movement by air must be performed, in order to come  within the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, should be  individually determined with respect to any particular airport or city  served by an airport, and whether there should be established therefor  appropriate boundaries differing in extent from this defined in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exempt zones and operations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dulles and Baltimore-Washington  International Airports.
