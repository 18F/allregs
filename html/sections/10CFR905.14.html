                                Sec. 905.14  Does Western require annual IRP progress reports?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, customers must submit IRP progress reports each year within 30 days of the anniversary date of the approval of the currently applicable IRP. The reports must describe the customer's accomplishments achieved under the action plan, including projected goals and implementation schedules, and energy and capacity benefits and renewable energy developments achieved as compared to those anticipated. Western prefers measured values, but will accept reasonable estimates if measurement is infeasible or not cost-effective. Instead of a separate progress report, the customer may use any other annual report that the customer submits to Western or another entity, at the customer's discretion, if that report contains all required data for the previous full year and is submitted within 30 days of the approval anniversary date of the currently applicable IRP. With Western's approval, customers may submit reports outside of the 30-day anniversary date window.</p>
