                            <p class="depth0">This part 783 is the official interpretation of the Department of  Labor with respect to the meaning and application of sections 6(b)(2),  13(a)(14), and 13(b)(6) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended,  which govern the application of the minimum wage and overtime pay  requirements of the Act to employees employed as seamen. Prior to the  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, which became effective on  September 3, 1961, all employees employed as seamen were exempt from  both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions of the Act. The 1961  amendments have narrowed this exemption so as to extend the minimum wage  provisions of the Act to employees employed as seamen on American  vessels. Employees employed as seamen on vessels other than American  vessels continue to be exempt from both the minimum wage and the  overtime pay requirements of the Act. It is the purpose of this part to  make available in one place the interpretations of the law relating to  employees employed as seamen which will guide the Secretary of Labor and  the Administrator in the performance of their duties under the Act.</p>
