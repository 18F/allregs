                                Sec. 208.33  Cheney Dam and Reservoir, North Fork of Ninnescah
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Bureau of Reclamation, or its designated agent, shall operate the Cheney Dam and Reservoir in the interest of flood control as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Flood control storage in the reservoir is the capacity between elevation 1421.6 (top of the conservation pool) and elevation 1429.0 (top of the flood control pool), and initially amounts to 80,860 acre-feet. Whenever the reservoir level is within this range the flood control discharge facilities shall be operated under the direction of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, so as to reduce as much as practicable the flood damage below the reservoir. All flood control releases shall be made in amounts which, when combined with local inflow below the dam, will not produce flows in excess of bankfull on the North Fork of Ninnescah and Ninnescah River downstream of the reservoir and on the Arkansas River to Arkansas City, Kans. In order to accomplish this, flows shall not exceed a 90-foot stage (2,500 c.f.s.) on the U.S.G.S. gage on North Fork of Ninnescah River near Cheney, Kans., river mile 8.8; a 12-foot stage (7,000 c.f.s.) on the U.S.G.S. gage on Ninnescah River near Peck, Kans., river mile 31.6; and a 16-foot stage (18,000 c.f.s.) on the U.S.W.B. gage on Arkansas River at Arkansas City, Kans., river mile 701.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the reservoir level exceeds elevation 1429.0 (top of flood control pool), releases shall be made at the maximum rate possible through the river outlet works and the uncontrolled spillway and continued until the pool recedes to elevation 1429.0 when releases shall be made to equal inflow or the maximum release permissible under paragraph (a) of this section, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The representative of the Bureau of Reclamation or its designated agent in immediate charge of operation of the Cheney Dam shall furnish daily to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, in charge of the locality, a report, on forms provided by the District Engineer for this purpose, showing the pool elevation; the number of river outlet works gates in operation with their respective openings and releases; uncontrolled spillway release; municipal pumping rate; storage; tailwater elevation; reservoir inflow; available evaporation data; and precipitation in inches. Normally, a reading at 8 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., and midnight, shall be shown for each day. Whenever the reservoir pool rises to elevation 1421.6 and releases for flood regulation are necessary or appear imminent, the representative of the Bureau of Reclamation or its designated agent, shall report at once to the District Engineer by telephone or telegraph, and, unless otherwise instructed, shall report once daily thereafter in that manner until the reservoir pool recedes to elevation 1421.6. These latter reports shall reach the District Engineer by 9 a.m. each day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The regulations of this section, insofar as they govern use of flood control storage capacity above elevation 1421.6, are subject to temporary modification in time of flood by the District Engineer if found desirable on the basis of conditions at the time. Such desired modifications shall be communicated to the representative of the Bureau of Reclamation and its designated agent in immediate charge of operations of the Cheney Dam by any available means of communication, and shall be confirmed in writing under date of the same day to the Regional Director in charge of the locality, and his designated agent, with a copy to the representative in charge of the Cheney Dam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Flood control operation shall not restrict pumping necessary for municipal and industrial uses and releases necessary for downstream users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Releases made in accordance with the regulations of this section are subject to the condition that releases shall not be made at rates or in a manner that would be inconsistent with emergency requirements for protecting the dam and reservoir from major damage or inconsistent with the safe routing of the inflow design flood (spillway design flood).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The discharge characteristics of the river outlet works (capable of discharging approximately 3,590 c.f.s. with the reservoir level at elevation 1421.6) shall be maintained in accordance with the construction plans (Bureau of Reclamation Specifications No. DC-5744 as modified by revised drawings and criteria in Designers' Operating Criteria, Cheney Dam, dated November 1964).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All elevations stated in this section are at Cheney Dam and are referred to the datum in use at that location.
