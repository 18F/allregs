                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An EIS must be prepared for proposed major Federal actions that will have significant impacts on the human environment. The agency decision in the case of an EIS is reflected in a ROD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a proposed major Federal action has the potential for significantly affecting the human environment, but it is not clear whether the impacts of that particular action will in fact be significant, or where the nature of an action precludes use of a categorical exclusion, an EA may be used to assist the agency in determining whether to prepare an EIS. If the agency determination in the case of an EA is that there is no significant impact on the environment, the findings will be reflected in a FONSI. If the EA determines that the proposed action is likely to significantly affect the environment (even after mitigation), then an EIS will be prepared. An EA also may be used where it otherwise will aid compliance with NEPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.18(a)) define major federal actions subject to evaluation under NEPA to include, among other things, ``new and continuing activities''. The term new activities is intended to encompass future actions, i.e., those which are not ongoing at the time of the proposal. The term continuing activities which may necessitate the preparation of a NEPA document will be applied by the Department of Navy to include activities which are presently being carried out in fulfillment of the Navy mission and function, including existing training functions, where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The currently occurring environmental effects of which have not been previously evaluated in a NEPA document, and there is a discovery that substantial environmental degradation is occurring, or is likely to occur, as a result of ongoing operations (e.g., a discovery that significant beach erosion is occurring as a result of continuing amphibious exercises, new designation of wetland habitat, or discovery of an endangered species residing in the area of the activity), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a discovery that the environmental effects of an ongoing activity are significantly and qualitatively different or more severe than predicted in a NEPA document prepared in connection with the commencement of the activity.
A substantial change in a continuing activity (such as a substantial change in operational tempo, area of use, or in methodology/equipment) which has the potential for significant environmental impacts should be considered a proposal for a new action and be documented accordingly. Preparation of a NEPA document is not a necessary prerequisite, nor a substitute, for compliance with other environmental laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where emergency circumstances require immediate action, for the protection of lives and for public health and safety, which could result in significant harm to the environment, the activity Commanding Officer or his designee shall report the emergency action to CNO (OP-44E)/CMC (LFL) who will facilitate the appropriate consultation with CEQ as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A categorical exclusion (CATEX), as defined and listed in this regulation, may be used to exclude a proposed action from further analysis. Even though a proposed action generally is

covered by a listed categorical exclusion, a categorical exclusion will not be used if the proposed action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Would adversely affect public health or safety;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Involves effects on the human environment that are highly uncertain, involve unique or unknown risks, or which are scientifically controversial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishes precedents or makes decisions in principle for future actions that have the potential for significant impacts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Threatens a violation of Federal, state, or local environmental laws applicable to the Department of the Navy; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Involves an action that, as determined in coordination with the appropriate resource agency, may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have an adverse effect on Federally listed endangered/threatened species or marine mammals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have an adverse effect on coral reefs or on Federally designated wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, marine sanctuaries, or parklands;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adversely affect the size, function or biological value of wetlands and is not covered by a nation-wide or regional permit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Have an adverse effect on archaeological resources or resources (including but not limited to ships, aircraft, vessels and equipment) listed or determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Result in an uncontrolled or unpermitted release of hazardous substances or require a conformity determination under standards of the Clean Air Act General Conformity Rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Categorical exclusions. Subject to the criteria in paragraph (e) above, the following categories of actions are excluded from further analysis under NEPA. The CNO and CMC shall determine whether a decision to forego preparation of an EA or EIS on the basis of one or more categorical exclusions must be documented in an administrative record and the format for such record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Routine fiscal and administrative activities, including administration of contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routine law and order activities performed by military personnel, military police, or other security personnel, including physical plant protection and security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Routine use and operation of existing facilities, laboratories, and equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative studies, surveys, and data collection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Issuance or modification of administrative procedures, regulations, directives, manuals, or policy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Military ceremonies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Routine procurement of goods and services conducted in accordance with applicable procurement regulations, executive orders, and policies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Routine repair and maintenance of buildings, facilities, vessels, aircraft, and equipment associated with existing operations and activities (e.g., localized pest management activities, minor erosion control measures, painting, refitting);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Training of an administrative or classroom nature;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Routine personnel actions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Routine movement of mobile assets (such as ships and aircraft) for homeport reassignments, for repair/overhaul, or to train/perform as operational groups where no new support facilities are required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Routine procurement, management, storage, handling, installation, and disposal of commercial items, where the items are used and handled in accordance with applicable regulations (e.g., consumables, electronic components, computer equipment, pumps);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Routine recreational/welfare activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Alteration of and additions to existing buildings, facilities, structures, vessels, aircraft, and equipment to conform or provide conforming use specifically required by new or existing applicable legislation or regulations (e.g., hush houses for aircraft engines, scrubbers for air emissions, improvements to storm water and sanitary and industrial wastewater collection and treatment systems, and installation of fire fighting equipment);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The modification of existing systems or equipment when the environmental effects will remain substantially the same and the use is consistent with applicable regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Routine movement, handling and distribution of materials, including hazardous materials/wastes that are moved, handled, or distributed in accordance with applicable regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> New activities conducted at established laboratories and plants (including contractor-operated laboratories and plants) where all airborne emissions, waterborne effluent, external ionizing and non-ionizing radiation levels, outdoor noise, and solid and bulk waste disposal practices are in compliance with existing applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Studies, data, and information gathering that involve no permanent physical change to the environment (e.g., topographic surveys, wetlands mapping, surveys for evaluating environmental damage, and engineering efforts to support environmental analyses);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Temporary placement and use of simulated target fields (e.g., inert mines, simulated mines, or passive hydrophones) in fresh, estuarine, and marine waters for the purpose of non-explosive military training exercises or research, development, test and evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Installation and operation of passive scientific measurement devices (e.g., antennae, tide gauges, weighted hydrophones, salinity measurement devices, and water quality measurement devices) where use will not result in changes in operations tempo and is consistent with applicable regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Short-term increases in air operations up to 50 percent of the typical operation rate, or increases of 50 operations per day, whichever is greater.
