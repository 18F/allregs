It also includes employees in the excepted service  serving trial periods, whose tenure is indefinite solely because they  occupy obligated positions; or whose tenure is equivalent to career- conditional in the competitive service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency Exceptions. As an exception to the general definition of  part-time employment in Sec. 340.202(a) and under the authority  provided in 5 U.S.C. 3402(a)(3), an agency may permit an employee who  has an appointment in tenure group I or II to perform regularly  scheduled work of from 1 to 15 hours per week.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mixed Tours of Duty. The provisions of this subpart and the term  ``part-time career employment'' do not apply to employees with  appointments in tenure groups I or II who work under mixed tours of  duty. For this purpose, a mixed tour of duty consists of annually  recurring periods of full-time, part-time, or intermittent service as  long as the employee does not work part-time more than 6 pay periods per  calendar year.
