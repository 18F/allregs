If the narrative is part of the certification form, then the narrative must be located immediately prior to the physician's signature.

This documentation shall be provided upon request to the home health agency, review entities, and/or

CMS. Criteria for patient eligibility are described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section.
