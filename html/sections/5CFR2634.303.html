                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as indicated in Sec. 2634.308(b) of this subpart, each financial disclosure report filed pursuant to this subpart shall include a brief description, the date and value (using the categories of value in Sec. 2634.301(d) of this subpart) of any purchase, sale, or exchange by the filer during the reporting period, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeds $1,000:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Of real property, other than a personal residence of the filer or spouse, as defined in Sec. 2634.105(l) of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Of stocks, bonds, commodity futures, mutual fund shares, and other forms of securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. (1) Any transaction solely by and between the reporting individual, his spouse, and dependent children need not be reported under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions involving Treasury bills, notes, and bonds; money market mutual funds or accounts; and personal savings accounts (as defined in Sec. 2634.301(c)(2) of this subpart) need not be reported when occurring at rates, terms, and conditions available generally to members of the public. Likewise, transactions involving portfolio holdings of trusts and investment funds described in Sec. 2634.310 (b) and (c) of this subpart need not be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any transaction which occurred at a time when the reporting individual was not a Federal Government officer or employee need not be reported under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An official sells her personal residence in Virginia for $100,000 and purchases a personal residence in the District of Columbia for $200,000. She need not report the sale of the Virginia residence or the purchase of the D.C. residence.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. An official sells his beach home in Maryland for $50,000. Because he has rented it out for one month every summer, it does not qualify as a personal residence. He must disclose the sale under this section and any capital gain over $200 realized on the sale under Sec. 2634.302 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. An official sells a ranch to his dependent daughter. The official need not report the sale because it is a transaction between the reporting individual and a dependent child; however, any capital gain, except for that portion attributable to a personal residence, is required to be reported under Sec. 2634.302 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. An official sells an apartment building and realizes a loss of $100,000. He must report the sale of the building if the sale price of the property exceeds $1,000; however, he need not report anything under Sec. 2634.302 of this subpart, as the sale did not result in a capital gain.
