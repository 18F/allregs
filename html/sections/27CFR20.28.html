An appropriate TTB officer may detain any  container containing, or supposed to contain, spirits (including  denatured spirits and articles), when the appropriate TTB officer  believes those spirits, denatured spirits, or articles were produced,  withdrawn, sold, transported, or used in violation of law or this part.

Summary detention may not exceed 72 hours without  process of law or intervention of the appropriate TTB officer. The  person possessing the container immediately before its detention may  prepare a waiver of the 72 hours limitation to have the container kept  on his or her premises during detention.
