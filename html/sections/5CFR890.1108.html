Except as otherwise provided, a  change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay  period that begins after the date the employing office receives an  appropriate request to change the enrollment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Belated change of enrollment. When an employing office  determines that an enrollee was unable, for cause beyond his or her  control, to change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by  this section, the enrollee may do so within 60 days after the employing  office advises the enrollee of its determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change of enrollment by proxy. Subject to the discretion of the  employing office, an enrollee's representative, having written  authorization to do so, may change the enrollment for the enrollee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change to self only. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enrollee may change the enrollment  from self and family to self only at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change of enrollment to self only takes effect on the first  day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing  office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except  that at the request of the enrollee and upon a showing satisfactory to  the employing office that there was no family member eligible for  coverage under the family enrollment, the employing office may make the  change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in  which there was no family member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Open season. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During an open season as provided by Sec.  890.301(f), an enrollee (except for a former spouse who is eligible for  continued coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a)(3)) may change the enrollment  from self only to self and family, from one plan or option to another,  or make any combination of these changes. A former spouse who is  eligible for continued coverage under Sec. 890.1103(a)(3) may change  from one plan or option to another, but may not change from self only to  self and family unless the individual to be covered under the family  enrollment qualifies as a family member under Sec. 890.1106(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An open season change of enrollment takes effect on the first  day of the first pay period that begins in January of the next following  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a belated open season change of enrollment is accepted by  the employing office under paragraph (b) of this section, it takes  effect as required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Change in family status. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for a former spouse, an  enrollee may change the enrollment from self only to self and family,  from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these  changes when the enrollee's family status changes, including a change in  marital status or any other change in family status. The enrollee must  change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the  date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after the date  of the change in family status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a  child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other  manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the  child is born or becomes an eligible family member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reenrollment of individuals who lose other coverage under this  part. An individual whose continued coverage under this section  terminates because of the   provisions of Sec. 890.1110(a)(3) (termination due to other coverage  under another provision of this part) may reenroll if the coverage that  terminated the enrollment under this part ends, but not later than the  expiration of the period described in Sec. 890.1107. Coverage does not  extend beyond the expiration of the period described in Sec. 890.1107.  The effective date of the reenrollment is the day following the  termination of the coverage described in Sec. 890.1110(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Loss of coverage under this part or under another group  insurance plan.

Except as  otherwise provided, an enrollee must change the enrollment within the  period beginning 31 days before the date of loss of coverage and ending  60 days after the date of loss of coverage.

If the discontinuance is at a time other  than the end of the contract year, OPM must establish a time and  effective date for the enrollee to change the enrollment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the whole plan is discontinued, an enrollee who does not  change the enrollment within the time set is considered to have  cancelled the plan in which enrolled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a plan has two options, and one option of the plan is  discontinued, an enrollee who does not change the enrollment is  considered to be enrolled in the remaining option of the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the discontinuance of the plan, whether permanent or  temporary, is due to a disaster, the enrollee must change the enrollment  within 60 days of the disaster, as announced by OPM. If the enrollee  does not change the enrollment within the time frame announced by OPM,  the enrollee will be considered to be enrolled in the standard option of  the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan. The effective date  of enrollment changes under this provision will be set by OPM when it  makes the announcement allowing such changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Loss of coverage under the Medicaid program or similar State- sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Loss of coverage under a non-Federal health plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Move from comprehensive medical plan's area.

Similarly, an enrollee whose covered  family member moves outside the geographic area from which the plan  accepts enrollments, or if already outside this area, moves further from  this area, may change the enrollment upon notifying the employing office  of the family member's move. The change of enrollment takes effect on  the first day of the pay period that begins after the employing office  receives an appropriate request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> On becoming eligible for Medicare. An enrollee may change the  enrollment from one plan or option to another at any time beginning on  the 30th day before becoming eligible for coverage under title XVIII of  the Social Security Act (Medicare). A change of enrollment   based on becoming eligible for Medicare may be made only once.  [62 FR 38442, July 18, 1997, as amended at 72 FR 1912, Jan. 17, 2007]</p>
