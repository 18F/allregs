In the case of softwood lumber products  from Canada listed in Annex 1A of the SLA 2006 as covered by the scope  of the Agreement, the following information must be included on the  electronic entry summary documentation (CBP Form 7501) for each entry  (except for entries of softwood lumber products whose Region of Origin  is the Maritimes, in which case entry summary documentation must be  submitted in paper as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Region of Origin. The letter code representing a softwood lumber  product's Canadian Region of Origin, as posted on the Administrative  Message Board in the Automated Commercial System.

Where an Export Permit Number is not required  because the imported softwood lumber product is specifically identified  as exempt from SLA 2006 export measures pursuant to Annex 1A of the  Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the exempt   goods are classifiable in residual Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the  United States provisions otherwise listed as covered by the SLA 2006,  the alpha-numeric code ``P88888888'' must be used in the Export Permit  Number data entry field on the CBP Form 7501.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Original Maritime Certificate of Origin.
