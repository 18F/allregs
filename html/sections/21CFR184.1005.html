It is produced by fermentation of carbohydrates or by organic synthesis. The principal synthetic methods currently employed are oxidation of acetaldehyde derived from ethylene, liquid phase oxidation of butane, and reaction of carbon monoxide with methanol derived from natural gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed. (1981), p. 8, which is incorporated by reference.

The ingredient may also be used in boiler water additives at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived.
