                            <p class="depth0">Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the Authorized  Departmental Officer (ADO) shall make grants to those responsible,  eligible applicants whose applications are judged most meritorious under  the procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the ADO as  the effective date of the grant shall be no later than September 30 of  the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and  funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by  law. It should be noted that the project need not be initiated on the  grant effective date, but as soon thereafter as practical so that  project goals may be attained within the funded project period. All  funds granted by OEPNU under this program shall be expended solely for  the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance   with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part,  the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost  principles, and the applicable Department assistance regulations  (including part 3019 of this title).</p>
