In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by January 1, 1981 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January as additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
