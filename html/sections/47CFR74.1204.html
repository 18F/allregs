For purposes of determining compliance with Sec.  73.207 of this chapter, translator stations will be treated as Class A stations and booster stations will be treated the same as their FM radio broadcast station equivalents. FM radio broadcast station equivalents will be determined in accordance with Sec. Sec.  73.210 and 73.211 of this chapter, based on the booster station's ERP and HAAT. Provided, however, that FM translator stations and booster stations operating with less than 100 watts ERP will be treated as class D stations and will not be subject to intermediate frequency separation requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An application for an FM translator station will not be accepted for filing if it specifies a location within 320 kilometers (approximately 199 miles) of either the Canadian or Mexican borders and it does not comply with Sec.  74.1235(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> FM booster stations shall be subject to the requirement that the signal of any first adjacent channel station must exceed the signal of the booster station by 6 dB at all points within the protected contour of any first adjacent channel station, except that in the case of FM stations on adjacent channels at spacings that do not meet the minimum distance separations specified in Sec.  73.207 of this chapter, the signal of any first adjacent channel station must exceed the signal of the booster by 6 dB at any point within the predicted interference free contour of the adjacent channel station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> FM translator stations authorized prior to June 1, 1991 with facilities that do not comply with the predicted interference protection provisions of this section, may continue to operate, provided that operation is in conformance with Sec.  74.1203 regarding actual interference. Applications for major changes in FM translator stations must specify facilities that comply with provisions of this section.
