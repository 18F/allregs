Except as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, a Medicare enrollee is entitled to receive from an HMO or CMP all the Medicare-covered services that are available to individuals residing in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Part A and Part B services. Except as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, a Medicare enrollee is entitled to receive from an HMO or CMP all the Medicare-covered services that are available to individuals residing in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medicare Part A and Part B services if the enrollee is entitled to benefits under both programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Medicare Part B services if the enrollee is entitled only under that program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplemental services elected by an enrollee. (i) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP may elect to pay for optional services that are offered by the HMO or CMP in addition to the covered Part A and Part B services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP may elect to pay for optional services that are offered by the HMO or CMP in addition to the covered Part A and Part B services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An HMO or CMP may elect to provide qualified prescription drug coverage (as defined at Sec. 423.104 of this chapter) as an optional supplemental service in accordance with the applicable requirements under part 423 of this chapter, including Sec. 423.104(f)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The HMO or CMP may not set health status standards for those enrollees whom it accepts for these optional supplemental services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Supplemental services imposed by a risk HMO or CMP. (i) Subject to CMS's approval, a risk HMO or CMP may require Medicare enrollees to accept and pay for services in addition to those covered by Medicare. (ii) If the HMO or CMP elects this option, it must impose the requirement on all Medicare enrollees, without regard to health status. (iii) CMS approves supplemental benefits of this type if CMS determines that imposition of the requirements will not discourage other Medicare beneficiaries from enrolling in the risk HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional benefits from risk HMOs or CMPs required by statute. Subject to the conditions stated in Sec. 417.442, a new Medicare enrollee or a current nonrisk Medicare enrollee who converts to risk reimbursement under Sec. 417.444 is eligible to receive, in addition to the covered Part A and Part B benefits for which he or she is eligible, benefits consisting of one or both of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reduction in the HMO's or CMP's premium rate or in other charges for services furnished to Medicare enrollees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provision of health benefits or services beyond the required Part A and Part B coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special supplemental benefits.

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a Medicare enrollee who elects to receive hospice care under Sec. 418.24 of this chapter waives the right to receive from the HMO or CMP any Medicare services (including services equivalent to hospice care) that are related to the terminal condition for which the enrollee elected hospice care, or to a related condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Basic rule.

For the period that the Medicare enrollee's election of hospice care is in effect, CMS pays a cost HMO or CMP only as described in Sec. 417.585.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on provision of inpatient hospital services. If a beneficiary's effective date of coverage, as specified in Sec. 417.450, in a risk HMO or CMP occurs during an inpatient stay in a hospital paid for under part 412 of this chapter, the HMO or CMP--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not responsible for the provision of any of the inpatient hospital services under Part A during the stay and is not required to pay for those services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must assume responsibility for payment for or provision of inpatient hospital services under Part A on the day after the day of discharge from the inpatient stay; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is responsible for the full scope of services under paragraph (b) of this section, other than inpatient hospital services under Part A, beginning on the effective date of enrollment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Extension of provision of inpatient hospital services. If an enrollee's effective date of disenrollment, as defined by Sec. 417.460, occurs during an inpatient stay in a hospital paid for under part 412 of this chapter and the stay is provided or arranged for by the HMO or CMP, or the HMO or CMP is financially responsible for the hospitalization under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the HMO or CMP--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is financially responsible for payment of the inpatient services under Part A through the date the beneficiary is discharged from the inpatient stay; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not responsible for the provision of services, furnished on or after the effective date of disenrollment, other than inpatient hospital services under Part A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care. (1) If an enrollee is an inpatient of a hospital, entitlement to inpatient hospital care continues until he or she receives notice of noncoverage of that care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an enrollee is an inpatient of a hospital, entitlement to inpatient hospital care continues until he or she receives notice of noncoverage of that care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before giving notice of noncoverage, the HMO or CMP must obtain the concurrence of its affiliated physician responsible for the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The HMO or CMP must give the enrollee written notice that includes the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reason why inpatient hospital care is no longer needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effective date of the enrollee's liability for continued inpatient care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The enrollee's appeal rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the HMO or CMP delegates to the hospital the determination of noncoverage of inpatient care, the hospital obtains the concurrence of the HMO- or CMP-affiliated physician responsible for the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP, and sends notice, following the procedures set forth in Sec. 412.42(c)(3) of this chapter.
