                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Method of conducting. Any referendum held as provided in section  5 of the Act shall be conducted by the Division in accordance with this  section. The Director shall determine (1) the market or group of markets  to be covered by a referendum; (2) when a referendum is to be held; and  (3) the period during which growers, entitled to vote therein, may cast  their ballots. When a referendum is held for a group of markets, the  result of such referendum may be construed to apply either individually  or collectively to such markets. Before holding a referendum, the  Division shall establish from the records of the collectors of internal  revenue for the preceding marketing season, or in the absence of such  records then from such other reliable sources of information as are  available, a list showing the names of all growers who are entitled to  vote in the referendum, and from the list so established the eligibility  of growers to vote in a referendum shall be determined by the Division:  Provided, That if a grower, whose name appears on such lists for two or  more markets selling the same class of tobacco, votes in one referendum  for a market selling such type, he shall not be eligible to vote in a  referendum for any other market selling such type. If no growers sold  tobacco at auction on a proposed new market during the preceding  marketing season, then the list of growers entitled to vote in the  referendum shall be comprised of the growers residing in the county  where the pRoposed new market is located and in the adjacent counties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Form of ballot. Ballots to be used for voting in a referendum  held under the Act shall be in a form approved for the purpose by the  Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distribution of ballots. Ballots to be used by growers in a  referendum under the act may be distributed by mail or otherwise as the  Director may select. The Director may establish and publish a list of  voting places for the purpose of any referendum and distribute ballots  therefrom. When ballots are not mailed directly to growers who are  entitled to vote, insofar as their addresses are known, the Director  shall announce the voting places at which ballots can be secured, and  copies of such announcement shall be given to the press and mailed, for  posting and distribution, to the post offices of the market or group of  markets covered by the referendum and to post offices in the vicinity of  such markets or group of markets. Any explanatory statement with  reference to a referendum, provisions of the Act and these regulations,  or the operation and benefits of the services authorized by the act may  be attached to or supplied with ballots.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Filing and tabulation of votes. Each ballot, when filled in and  signed by a grower entitled to vote in a referendum, shall be mailed or  delivered by him as specified in the ballot. Persons authorized by the  Director to receive votes in any referendum shall promptly file all  votes received or collected by them with the Division. All ballots filed  in a referendum shall be examined to verify the eligibility of the voter  and the Director shall have   compiled the result of the referendum and furnish the Secretary a  statement showing whether or not two-thirds of the growers voting  favored the designation of the market or group of markets covered by the  referendum. In verifying votes, ballots which do not show the desire of  the voter, or ballots which are defective or illegible, or ballots on  which the signature or other identification does not correspond with the  established list shall not be counted. The choice of any individual  voter shall not be divulged by any official of the Division, except to  the Secretary when requested. Votes, ballots, and other documents  pertaining to a referendum shall be preserved in the Division for a  period of 2 years from the closing date of such referendum, and may be  destroyed thereafter.  [13 FR 9474, Dec. 31, 1948; 19 FR 57, Jan. 6, 1954, as amended at 55 FR  21738, May 29, 1990]    Sec. 29.74a  Producer referenda on mandatory grading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Method of conducting. Referenda shall be conducted among  producers who were engaged in the production of the following types of  tobacco harvested in the immediately preceding crop year: flue-cured  tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, 14; Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured tobacco,  types 22 and 23; Virginia fire-cured tobacco, type 21; Virginia sun- cured tobacco, type 37; dark air-cured tobacco, types 35 and 36; burley  tobacco, type 31; and cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 53,  54, and 55. A referendum will be conducted for each kind of tobacco and  the results will apply to each individual kind. A producer is eligible  to vote in referenda for each kind of tobacco they produce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Farmers engaged in the production of tobacco. For purposes of  the referenda, persons engaged in the production of tobacco includes any  person who is entitled to share in a crop of the tobacco or the proceeds  thereof because he or she shares in the risks of production of the crop  as an owner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper (a landlord whose return  from the crop is fixed regardless of the amount of the crop produced is  excluded) on a farm on which such crop is planted in a workmanlike  manner for harvest: Provided, That any failure to harvest the crop  because of conditions beyond the control of such person shall not affect  his or her status as a person engaged in the production of the crop. In  addition, persons engaged in the production of tobacco also includes  each person who it is determined would have had an interest as a  producer in the crop on a farm for which a farm allotment under the  quota program (7 CFR part 723, subpart B) for the crop was established  and no acreage of the crop was planted but an acreage of the crop was  regarded as planted for history acreage purposes under the applicable  Farm Service Agency commodity regulations of the Department of  Agriculture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> One vote limitation. Each person eligible to vote in a  particular referendum shall be entitled to only one vote in such  referendum regardless of the number of farms in which such person is  interested or the number of communities, counties, or States in which  farms are located in which farms such person is interested: Provided,  That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual members of a partnership shall each be entitled  to one vote, but the partnership as an entity shall not be entitled to  vote;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual eligible voter shall be entitled to one vote even  though he or she is interested in an entity (including but not limited  to a corporation) which entity is also eligible to vote;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A person shall also be entitled to vote in each instance of  his or her capacity as a fiduciary (including but not limited to a  guardian, administrator, executor or trustee) if in such fiduciary  capacity he or she is eligible to vote but the person for whom he or she  acts as a fiduciary shall not be eligible to vote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Joint and family interest. Where several persons, such as  members of a family, have participated or will participate in the  production of tobacco under the same lease or cropping agreement, only  the person or persons who signed the lease or agreement, or agreed to an  oral lease or agreement, shall be eligible to vote. Where two or more  persons have produced or will produce tobacco as joint tenants, tenants  in common, or owners of community property, each such person shall   be entitled to one vote if otherwise eligible. The eligibility of one  spouse does not affect the eligibility of the other spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Minors. A minor shall be entitled to one vote if he or she is  otherwise eligible and is 18 years of age or older when he or she votes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Interpretation. In the case of tobacco on a farm where no  acreage of tobacco is actually planted but an acreage of the commodity  is regarded as planted under applicable regulations of the Department of  Agriculture, persons on the farm who it is determined would have had an  interest in the commodity as a producer if an acreage of the commodity  had been actually planted shall be eligible to vote in the referendum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Referenda procedures. See part 717 of chapter VII of this title  for eligibility criteria and the procedures to be used in carrying out  mandatory grading referenda. Where not inconsistent with this part, the  definitions contained in parts 717, 718 and 723 of this title will  govern administration of these referenda. A copy of the regulations in  parts 717, 718, and 723 of this title, a referendum ballot, and voting  procedures are available for review in any USDA Service Center.  [67 FR 9896, Mar. 5, 2002]</p>
