                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Generally. A registered foreign board of trade that wishes to make an additional futures, option or swap contract available for trading by identified members or other participants located in the United States with direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system must submit a written request prior to offering the contracts from within the United States. Such a written request must include the terms and conditions of the additional futures, option or swap contracts and a certification that the additional contracts meet the requirements of Sec.  48.8(c), if applicable, and that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the requirements and conditions of registration. The foreign board of trade can make available for trading by direct access the additional contracts ten business days after the date of receipt by the Commission of the written request, unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade that additional time is needed to complete its review of policy or other issues pertinent to the additional contracts. A registered foreign board of trade may list for trading by direct access an additional futures or option contract on a non-narrow-based security index pursuant to the Commission certification procedures set forth in Sec.  30.13(d) and appendix D to part 30 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Option contracts on previously approved futures contracts.
