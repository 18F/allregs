                            <p class="depth0">When an incident of substantial interest to the Service, involving Service property or affiliated personnel, occurs off-installation, the Service law enforcement organization exercising area responsibility will--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Obtain copies of civilian law enforcement reports for processing or forwarding according to applicable Service parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Return apprehended persons to representatives of their Service as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 631--Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board</p><p class="depth0">Procedures Guide</p><p class="depth0">A-1. Purpose. This guide prescribes procedures for the establishment, operation, and coordination of AFDCBs. AFDCB proceedings are not adversarial in nature.</p><p class="depth0">A-2. Meetings.</p><p class="depth0">a. The board will meet quarterly. The commander establishing the AFDCB may specify whether the meetings will be open or closed. If not specified, the decision is at the discretion of the president of the board. Normally proceedings are closed, but may be opened to the public when circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth0">b. Special meetings may be called by the president of the board. Except by unanimous consent of members present, final action will be taken only on the business for which the meeting was called.</p><p class="depth0">c. A majority of voting members constitutes a quorum for board proceedings.</p><p class="depth0">A-3. AFDCB composition. Voting members will be selected per section 631.7.</p><p class="depth0">A-4. Attendance of observers or witnesses.</p><p class="depth0">a. The board may invite individual persons or organization representatives as witnesses or observers if they are necessary or appropriate for the conduct of board proceedings. The below listed authorities may assist in addressing installation or command concerns or issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal, State, and local judicial, legislative, and law enforcement officials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Housing part and enforcement authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Health, and social service authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Environmental protection authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alcoholic beverage control authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Equal employment opportunity authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Consumer affairs advocates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Chamber of Commerce representatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Public works or utility authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Local fire marshal, and public safety authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> State and local school board or education officials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Any other representation deemed appropriate by the sponsoring command such as, news media, union representatives, and so forth.</p><p class="depth0">b. Invited witnesses and observers will be listed in the minutes of the meeting.</p><p class="depth0">A-5. Appropriate areas for board consideration.</p><p class="depth0">a. Boards will study and take appropriate action on all reports of conditions considered detrimental to the good order and discipline, health, morale, welfare, safety, and morals of Armed Forces personnel. These adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, those identified in Sec. 631.9.</p><p class="depth0">b. The board will immediately forward to the local commander reported circumstances involving discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, age, or national origin.</p><p class="depth0">A-6. Off-limit procedures.</p><p class="depth0">a. Off-limits restrictions should be invoked only when there is substantive information indicating that an establishment or area frequented by Armed Forces personnel presents conditions, which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale, or morals. It is essential that boards do not act arbitrarily. Actions must not be of a punitive nature. Boards should work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of business establishments, and seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative efforts. Boards should encourage personal visits by local military, and civilian enforcement or health officials to establishments considered below standard. AFDCBs should point out unhealthy conditions or undesirable practices to establishment owners or operators to produce the desired corrective action.</p><p class="depth0">b. In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on letters written by the Equal Opportunity Office, and Military Affairs Committee or investigations of alleged racial discrimination.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment, the president or a designee will prepare, and submit a report of findings, and recommendations at the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete, and documented information concerning questionable adverse conditions.</p><p class="depth0">d. When the board concludes that conditions adverse to Armed Forces personnel do exist, the owner or manager will be sent a letter of notification (Annex A). This letter will advise him or her to raise standards by a specified date, and, if such conditions or practices continue, off-limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals responsible for adverse conditions, which may lead to off-limits action, will be by certified mail.</p><p class="depth0">e. If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions previously noted the board should send a letter of appreciation (Annex B) recognizing this cooperation.</p><p class="depth0">f. If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to appear before the AFDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off-limits (Annex C). Any proprietor may designate in writing a representative to appear before the board in his or her behalf.</p><p class="depth0">g. In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board, the president of the board will perform the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to calling the proprietor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Call for inspection reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allow those present to ask questions, and discuss the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the proprietor or his or her representative is called before the board--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Present the proprietor with a brief summary of the complaint concerning the establishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the questioning period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement before being dismissed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended only by board members.</p><p class="depth0">h. The board should recommend an off-limits restriction only after the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The letter of notification (Annex A) has been sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been extended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Further investigation indicates that improvements have not been made.</p><p class="depth0">i. The minutes will indicate the AFDCB's action in each case. When a recommendation is made to place an establishment off-limits, the minutes will show the procedural steps followed in reaching the decision.</p><p class="depth0">j. Recommendations of the AFDCB will be submitted to the sponsoring commander for consideration. The recommendations will then be forwarded to other installation commanders who are represented on the board (Annex D). If no objection to the recommendations is received within 10 days, the sponsoring commander will approve or disapprove the recommendations and forward the decision to the AFDCB president.</p><p class="depth0">k. Upon approval of the AFDCB's recommendations, the president will write the proprietor that the off-limits restriction has been imposed (Annex E).</p><p class="depth0">l. A time limit should not be specified when an off-limits restriction is revoked. The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment must be the determining factor in removing the off-limits restriction.</p><p class="depth0">m. Military authorities may not post off-limits signs or notices on private property.</p><p class="depth0">n. In emergencies, commanders may temporarily declare establishments or areas off-limits to service members subject to their jurisdiction. The circumstances for the action will be reported as soon as possible to the commander sponsoring the board. Detailed justification for this emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.</p><p class="depth0">o. Appropriate installation commanders will publish a list of off-limits establishments and areas using command and media channels.</p><p class="depth0">A-7. Removal of off-limits restrictions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Removal of an off-limits restriction requires AFDCB action. Proprietors of establishments declared off-limits should be advised that they may appeal to the appropriate AFDCB at any time. In their appeal they should submit the reason why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of the off-limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor if the AFDCB does not remove the off-limits restriction (Annex F). The proprietor may appeal to the next higher commander if not satisfied with continuance after exhausting all appeals at the local sponsoring commander level. Boards should make at least quarterly inspections of off-limits establishments. A statement that an inspection has been completed should be included in AFDCB minutes.</p><p class="depth0">b. When the board learns that the proprietor has taken adequate corrective measures, the AFDCB will take the following actions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Discuss the matter at the next meeting and make an appropriate recommendation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Forward a recommendation for removal of the off-limits restriction to the sponsoring commander. If approved, a letter removing the restriction (Annexes G & H) will be sent to the proprietor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The minutes will reflect action taken.</p><p class="depth0">A-8. Duties of the AFDCB president.</p><p class="depth0">The president of the AFDCB will--</p><p class="depth0">a. Schedule and preside at all AFDCB meetings.</p><p class="depth0">b. Provide an agenda to each voting member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting.</p><p class="depth0">c. Ensure records, minutes, and correspondence are prepared, distributed, and maintained per Sec. 631.10(d).</p><p class="depth0">A-9. Commanders.</p><p class="depth0">The installation commander, and commanders within an AFDCB's area of responsibility must be thoroughly acquainted with the mission and services provided by AFDCBs. AFDCB members should keep their respective commanders informed of command responsibilities pertaining to AFDCB functions and actions.</p><p class="depth0">A-10. Public affairs.</p><p class="depth0">a. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, there will not be a media release in connection with AFDCB meetings. However, any AFDCB proceeding, which is open to the public, will also be open to representatives of the news media. Representatives of the news media will be considered observers, and will not participate in matters considered by the AFDCB. Members of the news media may be invited to participate in an advisory status in coordination with the public affairs office.</p><p class="depth0">b. News media interviews and releases will be handled through the public affairs office according to applicable Service parts.</p><p class="depth0">A-11. Minutes.</p><p class="depth0">a. Minutes will be prepared in accordance with administrative formats for minutes of meetings prescribed by the Service of the sponsoring commander (Annex I). The written minutes of AFDCB meetings will constitute the official record of the AFDCB proceedings. Verbatim transcripts of board meetings are not required. The reasons for approving or removing an off-limits restriction, to include a complete address of the establishment or area involved, should be indicated in the order of business. In addition, the AFDCB's action will be shown in the order or sequence of actions taken. A change in the name of an establishment or areas in an off-limits restriction will also be included.</p><p class="depth0">b. Distribution of the minutes of AFDCB meetings will be limited to the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each voting member, sponsoring command, and commands and installations represented by the board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each civilian and military advisory member, if deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Civilian and Government agencies within the State in which member installations are located having an interest in the functions of the board, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">c. AFDCB minutes are subject to release and disclosure in accordance with applicable Service parts and directives.</p><p class="depth0">d. Minutes and recommendations of the board will be forwarded to the sponsoring commander for approval.</p><p class="depth0">Annex A--Letter of Notification</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Letterhead)</em></p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate AFDCB)
