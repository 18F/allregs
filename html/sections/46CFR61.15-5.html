                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Main steam piping shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test equal  to 1\1/4\ times the maximum allowable working pressure at the same  periods prescribed for boilers in Sec. 61.05-10. The hydrostatic test  shall be applied from the boiler drum to the throttle valve. If the  covering of the piping is not removed, the test pressure shall be  maintained on the piping for a period of ten minutes. If any evidence of  moisture or leakage is detected, the covering shall be removed and the  piping thoroughly examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All steam piping subject to pressure from the main boiler should  be subjected to a hydrostatic test at a pressure of 1\1/4\ times the  maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler after every five years  of service except as otherwise provided for in paragraph (a) of this  section. Unless the covering of the piping is removed, the test pressure  must be maintained on the piping for ten minutes. If any evidence of  moisture or leakage is detected, the covering should be removed and the  piping thoroughly examined. No piping with a nominal size of 3 inches or  less need be hydrostatically tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The setting of safety and relief valves installed in piping  systems shall be checked by the marine inspector at each inspection for  certification for vessels whose Certificates of Inspection are renewed  each year. For other vessels, the setting must be checked twice within  any 5-year period, and no more than 3 years may elapse between any check  and its immediate predecessor.
