                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. An employer must have a fire prevention plan when  an OSHA standard in this part requires one. The requirements in this  section apply to each such fire prevention plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written and oral fire prevention plans. A fire prevention plan  must be in writing, be kept in the workplace, and be made available to  employees for review. However, an employer with 10 or fewer employees  may communicate the plan orally to employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum elements of a fire prevention plan. A fire prevention  plan must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of all major fire hazards, proper handling and storage  procedures for hazardous materials, potential ignition sources and their  control, and the type of fire protection equipment necessary to control  each major hazard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures to control accumulations of flammable and combustible  waste materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for regular maintenance of safeguards installed on  heat-producing equipment to prevent the accidental ignition of  combustible materials;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name or job title of employees responsible for maintaining  equipment to prevent or control sources of ignition or fires; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The name or job title of employees responsible for the control  of fuel source hazards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee information. An employer must inform employees upon  initial assignment to a job of the fire hazards to which they are  exposed. An employer must also review with each employee those parts of  the fire prevention plan necessary for self-protection.  [67 FR 67961, Nov. 7, 2002]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix to Subpart E of Part 1910-Exit Routes, Emergency Action</p><p class="depth2">Plans, and Fire Prevention Plans</p><p class="depth2">This appendix serves as a nonmandatory guideline to assist employers  in complying with the appropriate requirements of subpart E.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. 1910.38  Employee emergency plans.</p><p class="depth2">1. Emergency action plan elements. The emergency action plan should  address emergencies that the employer may reasonably expect in the  workplace. Examples are: fire; toxic chemical releases; hurricanes;  tornadoes; blizzards; floods; and others. The elements of the emergency  action plan presented in paragraph 1910.38(c) can be supplemented by the  following to more effectively achieve employee safety and health in an  emergency. The employer should list in detail the procedures to be taken  by those employees who have been selected to remain behind to care for  essential plant operations until their evacuation becomes absolutely  necessary. Essential plant operations may include the monitoring of  plant power supplies, water supplies, and other essential services which  cannot be shut down for every emergency alarm. Essential plant  operations may also include chemical or manufacturing processes which  must be shut down in stages or steps where certain employees must be  present to assure that safe shut down procedures are completed.</p><p class="depth2">The use of floor plans or workplace maps which clearly show the  emergency escape routes should be included in the emergency action plan.  Color coding will aid employees in determining their route assignments.</p><p class="depth2">The employer should also develop and explain in detail what rescue  and medical first aid duties are to be performed and by whom. All  employees are to be told what actions they are to take in these  emergency situations that the employer anticipates may occur in the  workplace.</p><p class="depth2">2. Emergency evacuation. At the time of an emergency, employees  should know what type of evacuation is necessary and what their role is  in carrying out the plan. In some cases where the emergency is very  grave, total and immediate evacuation of all employees is necessary. In  other emergencies, a partial evacuation of nonessential employees with a  delayed evacuation of others may be necessary for continued plant  operation. In some cases, only those employees in the immediate area of  the fire may be expected to evacuate or move to a safe area such as when  a local application fire suppression system discharge employee alarm is  sounded. Employees must be sure that they know what is expected of them  in all such emergency possibilities which have been   planned in order to provide assurance of their safety from fire or other  emergency.</p><p class="depth2">The designation of refuge or safe areas for evacuation should be  determined and identified in the plan. In a building divided into fire  zones by fire walls, the refuge area may still be within the same  building but in a different zone from where the emergency occurs.</p><p class="depth2">Exterior refuge or safe areas may include parking lots, open fields  or streets which are located away from the site of the emergency and  which provide sufficient space to accommodate the employees. Employees  should be instructed to move away from the exit discharge doors of the  building, and to avoid congregating close to the building where they may  hamper emergency operations.</p><p class="depth2">3. Emergency action plan training. The employer should assure that  an adequate number of employees are available at all times during  working hours to act as evacuation wardens so that employees can be  swiftly moved from the danger location to the safe areas. Generally, one  warden for each twenty employees in the workplace should be able to  provide adequate guidance and instruction at the time of a fire  emergency. The employees selected or who volunteer to serve as wardens  should be trained in the complete workplace layout and the various  alternative escape routes from the workplace. All wardens and fellow  employees should be made aware of handicapped employees who may need  extra assistance, such as using the buddy system, and of hazardous areas  to be avoided during emergencies. Before leaving, wardens should check  rooms and other enclosed spaces in the workplace for employees who may  be trapped or otherwise unable to evacuate the area.</p><p class="depth2">After the desired degree of evacuation is completed, the wardens  should be able to account for or otherwise verify that all employees are  in the safe areas.</p><p class="depth2">In buildings with several places of employment, employers are  encouraged to coordinate their plans with the other employers in the  building. A building-wide or standardized plan for the whole building is  acceptable provided that the employers inform their respective employees  of their duties and responsibilities under the plan. The standardized  plan need not be kept by each employer in the multi-employer building,  provided there is an accessible location within the building where the  plan can be reviewed by affected employees. When multi-employer  building-wide plans are not feasible, employers should coordinate their  plans with the other employers within the building to assure that  conflicts and confusion are avoided during times of emergencies. In  multi-story buildings where more than one employer is on a single floor,  it is essential that these employers coordinate their plans with each  other to avoid conflicts and confusion.</p><p class="depth2">4. Fire prevention housekeeping. The standard calls for the control  of accumulations of flammable and combustible waste materials.</p><p class="depth2">It is the intent of this standard to assure that hazardous  accumulations of combustible waste materials are controlled so that a  fast developing fire, rapid spread of toxic smoke, or an explosion will  not occur. This does not necessarily mean that each room has to be swept  each day. Employers and employees should be aware of the hazardous  properties of materials in their workplaces, and the degree of hazard  each poses. Certainly oil soaked rags have to be treated differently  than general paper trash in office areas. However, large accumulations  of waste paper or corrugated boxes, etc., can pose a significant fire  hazard. Accumulations of materials which can cause large fires or  generate dense smoke that are easily ignited or may start from  spontaneous combustion, are the types of materials with which this  standard is concerned. Such combustible materials may be easily ignited  by matches, welder's sparks, cigarettes and similar low level energy  ignition sources.</p><p class="depth2">5. Maintenance of equipment under the fire prevention plan. Certain  equipment is often installed in workplaces to control heat sources or to  detect fuel leaks. An example is a temperature limit switch often found  on deep-fat food fryers found in restaurants. There may be similar  switches for high temperature dip tanks, or flame failure and flashback  arrester devices on furnaces and similar heat producing equipment. If  these devices are not properly maintained or if they become inoperative,  a definite fire hazard exists. Again employees and supervisors should be  aware of the specific type of control devices on equipment involved with  combustible materials in the workplace and should make sure, through  periodic inspection or testing, that these controls are operable.  Manufacturers' recommendations should be followed to assure proper  maintenance procedures.
