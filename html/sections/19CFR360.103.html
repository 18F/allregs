                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Steel import licenses will be issued to registered importers, customs brokers or their agents through an automatic steel import licensing system. The licenses will be issued automatically after the completion of the form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Customs entry number. Filers are not required to report a Customs entry number to obtain an import license but are encouraged to do so if the Customs entry number is known at the time of filing for the license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required to obtain an import license. (1) The following information is required to be reported in order to obtain an import license (if using the automatic licensing system, some of this information will be provided automatically from information submitted as part of the registration process):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following information is required to be reported in order to obtain an import license (if using the automatic licensing system, some of this information will be provided automatically from information submitted as part of the registration process):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Filer company name and address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Filer contact name, phone number, fax number and email address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Entry type (i.e., Consumption, FTZ)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Importer name;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Exporter name;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Manufacturer name (filer may state ``unknown'');</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Country of origin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Country of exportation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Expected date of export;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Expected date of import;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Expected port of entry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Current HTS number (from Chapters 72 or 73);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Quantity (in kilograms) and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Customs value (U.S. $).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain fields will be automatically filled out by the automatic license system based on information submitted by the filer (e.g., product category, unit value). Filers should review these fields to help confirm the accuracy of the submitted data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon completion of the form, the importer, customs broker or the importer's agent will certify as to the accuracy and completeness of the information and submit the form electronically. After refreshing the page, the system will automatically issue a steel import license number. The refreshed form containing the submitted information and the newly issued license number will appear on the screen (the ``license form''). Filers can print the license form themselves only at that time. For security purposes, users will not be able to retrieve licenses themselves from the license system at a later date for reprinting. If needed, copies of completed license forms can be requested from Commerce during normal business hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration of the steel import license. The steel import license can be applied for up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation and until the date of filing of the entry summary documents, or in the case of FTZ entries, the filing of Customs form 214. The steel import license is valid for 75 days; however, import licenses that were valid on the date of importation but expired prior to the filing of entry summary documents will be accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Correcting submitted license information. Users will need to correct licenses themselves if they determine that there was an error submitted. To access a previously issued license, a user must log on with his user identification code and identify the license number and the volume (in kilograms) for the first product shown on the license. The information on the license should match the information presented on the CF-7501 entry summary document as closely as possible; this includes the value and volume of the shipment, the expected date of importation, and the customs district of entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Low-value licenses. There is one exception to the requirement for obtaining a unique license for each Customs entry. If the total value of the covered steel portion of an entry is less than $250, applicants may apply to Commerce for a low-value license that can be used in lieu of a single entry license for low-value entries.</p>
