Sec. 1275.26 and 1275.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When the matter certified to the Board by the Senior Archival Panel involves a determination required in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the Board shall prepare a final written decision, together with dissenting and concurring opinions, of the proper categorization and disposition of the pertinent materials. The Board's decision will be the final administrative determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When the matter certified to the Board by the Senior Archival Panel involves a determination required in paragraph (c) of this section, the Board shall recommend an initial determination to the Senior Archival Panel, which shall retain the sole responsibility for the initial determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> When the Board considers a matter referred to it by the Archivist as provided in Sec. 1275.44(d), it shall follow these procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board shall notify the claimant of its consideration of the claim, and invite the claimant to supplement at his discretion the basis for the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board will publish notice in the Federal Register, advising the public of its consideration of the claim, and describing the materials in question as fully as reasonably possible without disclosing arguably private or personal information.
