This section applies to dominant carriers whose gross annual revenues exceed $500,000 for the most recent 12 month period of operations or are estimated to exceed $500,000 for a representative 12 month period. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers serving 50,000 or fewer access lines in a given study area that are described as subset 3 carriers in Sec. 69.602 of this chapter may submit Access Tariff filings for that study area pursuant to either this section or Sec. 61.39. However, the Commission may require any issuing carrier to submit such information as may be necessary for a review of a tariff filing. This section (other than the preceding sentence of this paragraph) shall not apply to tariff filings proposing rates for services identified in Sec. 61.42 (d), (e), and (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explanation and data supporting either changes or new tariff offerings. The material to be submitted for a tariff change which affects rates or charges or for a tariff offering a new service, must include an explanation of the changed or new matter, the reasons for the filing, the basis of ratemaking employed, and economic information to support the changed or new matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a tariff change the issuing carrier must submit the following, including complete explanations of the bases for the estimates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A cost of service study for all elements for the most recent 12 month period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A study containing a projection of costs for a representative 12 month period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Estimates of the effect of the changed matter on the traffic and revenues from the service to which the changed matter applies, the issuing carrier's other service classifications, and the carrier's overall traffic and revenues. These estimates must include the projected effects on the traffic and revenues for the same representative 12 month period used in (b)(1)(ii) above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a tariff filing offering a new service, the issuing carrier must submit the following, including complete explanations of the bases for the estimates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A study containing a projection of costs for a representative 12 month period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estimates of the effect of the new matter on the traffic and revenues from the service to which the new matter applies, the issuing carrier's other service classifications, and the issuing carrier's overall traffic and revenues. These estimates must include the projected effects on the traffic and revenues for the same representative 12 month period used in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For a tariff that introduces a system of density pricing zones, as described in Sec. 69.123 of this chapter, the issuing carrier must, before filing its tariff, submit a density pricing zone plan including, inter alia, documentation sufficient to establish that the system of zones reasonably reflects cost-related characteristics, such as the density of total interstate traffic in central offices located in the respective zones, and receive approval of its proposed plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Working papers and statistical data. (1) Concurrently with the filing of any tariff change or tariff filing for a service not previously offered, the issuing carrier must file the working papers containing the information underlying the data supplied in response to paragraph (b) of this section, and a clear explanation of how the working papers relate to that information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Concurrently with the filing of any tariff change or tariff filing for a service not previously offered, the issuing carrier must file the working papers containing the information underlying the data supplied in response to paragraph (b) of this section, and a clear explanation of how the working papers relate to that information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All statistical studies must be submitted and supported in the form prescribed in Sec. 1.363 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form and content of additional material to be submitted with certain rate increases. In the circumstances set out in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the issuing carrier must submit all additional cost, marketing and other data underlying the working papers to justify a proposed rate increase. The issuing carrier must submit this information in suitable form to serve as the carrier's direct case in the event the rate increase is set by the Commission for investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rate increases affecting single services or tariffed items.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A rate increase in any service or tariffed item which results in more than $1 million in additional annual revenues, calculated on the basis of existing quantities in service, without regard to the percentage increase in such revenues; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A single rate increase in any service or tariffed item, or successive rate increases in the same service or tariffed item within a 12 month period, either of which results in:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least a 10 percent increase in annual revenues from that service or tariffed item, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least $100,000 in additional annual revenues, both calculated on the basis of existing quantities in service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rate increases affecting more than one service or tariffed item.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A general rate increase in more than one service or tariffed item occurring at one time, which results in more than $1 million in additional revenues calculated on the basis of existing quantities in service, without regard to the percentage increase in such revenues; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A general rate increase in more than one service or tariffed item occurring at one time, or successive general rate increases in the same services or tariffed items occurring within a 12 month period, either of which results in:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least a 10 percent increase in annual revenues from those services or tariffed items, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least $100,000 in additional annual revenues, both calculated on the basis of existing quantities in service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submission of explanation and data by connecting carriers.
