                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  unless that person has satisfactorily completed the certificate holder's  FAA-approved initial or recurrent hazardous materials training program  within the past 24 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New hire or new job function. A person who is a new hire and has  not yet satisfactorily completed the required initial hazardous  materials training, or a person who is changing job functions and has  not received initial or recurrent training for a job function involving  storage incidental to transport, or loading of items for transport on an  aircraft, may perform those job functions for not more than 30 days from  the date of hire or a change in job function, if the person is under the  direct visual supervision of a person who is authorized by the  certificate holder to supervise that person and who has successfully  completed the certificate holder's FAA-approved initial or recurrent  training program within the past 24 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons who work for more than one certificate holder. A  certificate holder that uses or assigns a person to perform or directly  supervise a job function specified in Sec. 135.501(a), when that person  also performs or directly supervises the same job function for another  certificate holder, need only train that person in its own policies and  procedures regarding those job functions, if all of the following are  met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certificate holder using this exception receives written  verification from the person designated to hold the training records  representing the other certificate holder that the person has  satisfactorily completed hazardous materials training for the specific  job function under the other certificate holder's FAA approved hazardous  material training program under appendix O of part 121 of this chapter;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certificate holder who trained the person has the same  operations specifications regarding the acceptance, handling, and  transport of hazardous materials as the certificate holder using this  exception.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recurrent hazardous materials training--Completion date. A  person who satisfactorily completes recurrent hazardous materials  training in the calendar month before, or the calendar month after, the  month in which the recurrent training is due, is considered to have  taken that training during the month in which it is due. If the person  completes this training earlier than the month before it is due, the  month of the completion date becomes his or her new anniversary month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Repair stations. A certificate holder must ensure that each  repair station performing work for, or on the certificate holder's  behalf is notified in writing of the certificate holder's policies and  operations specification authorization permitting or prohibition against  the acceptance, rejection, handling, storage incidental to transport,  and transportation of hazardous materials,   including company material. This notification requirement applies only  to repair stations that are regulated by 49 CFR parts 171 through 180.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certificate holders operating at foreign locations. This  exception applies if a certificate holder operating at a foreign  location where the country requires the certificate holder to use  persons working in that country to load aircraft. In such a case, the  certificate holder may use those persons even if they have not been  trained in accordance with the certificate holder's FAA approved  hazardous materials training program. Those persons, however, must be  under the direct visual supervision of someone who has successfully  completed the certificate holder's approved initial or recurrent  hazardous materials training program in accordance with this part. This  exception applies only to those persons who load aircraft.</p>
