                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A transcranial magnetic stimulator device for  headache is a device that delivers brief duration, rapidly alternating,  or pulsed, magnetic fields that are externally directed at spatially  discrete regions of the brain to induce electrical currents for the  treatment of headache.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special  controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate analysis/testing must demonstrate electromagnetic  compatibility, electrical safety, and thermal safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appropriate verification, validation, and hazard analysis must  be performed on the device software and firmware.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The elements of the device that contact the patient must be  assessed to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-clinical testing data must demonstrate that the device  performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use. This includes  full characterization of the magnetic pulse output   and resulting magnetic field map. This also includes characterization of  the sound level of the device during use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Clinical testing must demonstrate that the device is safe and  effective for treating headache in the indicated patient population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The physician and patient labeling must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A summary of the clinical performance testing, including any  adverse events and complications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The intended use population in terms of the types of headaches  appropriate for use with the device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information on how to report adverse events and device  malfunctions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A diagram or picture depicting the proper placement of the  device on the user.
