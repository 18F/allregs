                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards  apply to the following vehicles, subject to the phase-in requirements in  Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(3) and (4):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 2010 and later model year LDV/LLDTs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 2012 and later model year HLDT/MDPVs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vehicles imported by ICIs as defined in 40 CFR 85.1502.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Useful life requirements. Full useful life requirements for cold  temperature NMHC standards are defined in Sec. 86.1805-04(g). There is  not an intermediate useful life standard for cold temperature NMHC  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Altitude. Altitude requirements for cold temperature NMHC  standards are provided in Sec. 86.1810-09(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Small volume manufacturer certification procedures.  Certification procedures for small volume manufacturers are provided in  Sec. 86.1838-01.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cold temperature NMHC standards. Fleet average cold temperature  NMHC standards are provided in Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Phase-in. Phase-in of the cold temperature NMHC standards are  provided in Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(3) and (4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Phase-in flexibilities for small volume manufacturers. Phase-in  flexibilities for small volume manufacturer compliance with the cold  temperature NMHC standards are provided in Sec. 86.1811-04(k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Hardship provisions for small volume manufacturers. Hardship  provisions for small volume manufacturers related to the cold  temperature NMHC standards are provided in Sec. 86.1811-04(q)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> In-use standards for applicable phase-in models. In-use cold  temperature NMHC standards for applicable phase-in models are provided  in Sec. 86.1811-10(u).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Durability procedures and method of determining deterioration  factors (DFs). The durability data vehicle selection procedures of  Sec. 86.1822-01 and the durability demonstration procedures of  Sec. 86.1823-06 apply for cold temperature NMHC standards. For  determining compliance with full useful life cold temperature NMHC  emission standards, the 68-86 F, 120,000 mile full useful life NMOG DF  may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Vehicle test procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test procedure for demonstrating  compliance with cold temperature NMHC standards is contained in subpart  C of this part. With prior EPA approval, alternative testing procedures  may be used, as specified in Sec. 86.106-96(a), provided cold  temperature NMHC emissions test results are equivalent or superior.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing of all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs to determine compliance with  cold temperature NMHC exhaust emission standards set forth in this  section must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis, as defined in  Sec. 86.1803-01.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Testing for the purpose of providing certification data is  required only at low altitude conditions and only for vehicles that can  operate on gasoline, except as requested in Secs. 86.1810-09(f) and  86.1844-01(d)(11). If hardware and software emission control strategies  used during low altitude condition testing are not used similarly across  all altitudes for in-use operation, the manufacturer must include a  statement in the application for certification, in accordance with  Secs. 86.1844-01(d)(11) and 86.1810-09(f), stating what the different  strategies are and why they are used. If hardware and software emission  control strategies used during testing with gasoline are not used  similarly with all fuels that can be used in multi-fuel vehicles, the  manufacturer will include a statement in the application for  certification, in accordance with Secs. 86.1844-01(d)(11) and 86.1810- 09(f), stating what the different strategies are and why they are used.  For example, unless a manufacturer states otherwise, air pumps used to  control emissions on dedicated gasoline vehicles or multi-fuel vehicles  during low altitude conditions must also be used to control emissions at  high altitude conditions, and software used to control emissions or  closed loop operation must also operate similarly at low and high  altitude conditions and similarly when multi-fueled vehicles are  operated on gasoline and alternate fuels. These examples are for  illustrative purposes only; similar strategies would apply to other  currently used emission control technologies and/or emerging or future  technologies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Emission data vehicle (EDV) selection. Provisions for selecting  the appropriate EDV for the cold temperature NMHC standards are provided  in Secs. 86.1828-10(g) and 86.1829-01(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Calculating the fleet average cold temperature NMHC standard.  Manufacturers must compute separate sales-weighted fleet average cold  temperature NMHC emissions at the end of the model year for LDV/LLDTs  and HLDT/MDPVs, using actual sales, and certifying test groups to FELs,  as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01. The FEL becomes the standard for each  test group, and every test group can have a different FEL. The  certification resolution for the FEL will be 0.1 grams/mile. LDVs and  LLDTs must be grouped together when calculating the fleet average, and  HLDTs and MDPVs must also be grouped together to determine the fleet  average. Manufacturers must compute the sales-weighted cold temperature  NMHC fleet averages using the following equation, rounded to the nearest  0.1 grams/mile:  Fleet average cold temperature NMHC exhaust emissions (grams/mile) =  [Sigma](N x FEL) / Total number of vehicles sold of the applicable  weight category (i.e., either LDV + LLDTs, or HLDT + MDPVs) Where:  N = The number of LDVs and LLDTs, or HLDTs and MDPVs, sold within the</p><p class="depth2">applicable FEL, based on vehicles counted to the point of</p><p class="depth2">first sale. FEL = Family Emission Limit (grams/mile).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Certification compliance and enforcement requirements for cold  temperature NMHC standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance and enforcement requirements  are provided in Sec. 86.1864-10 and Sec. 86.1848-10(c)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certificate issued for each test group requires all vehicles  within that test group to meet the emission standard or FEL to which the  vehicles were certified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable cold  temperature NMHC fleet average standard on a sales-weighted average  basis, at the end of each model year, using the procedure described in  paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Manufacturers must compute separate cold temperature NMHC fleet  averages for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs. The sales-weighted cold  temperature NMHC fleet averages must be compared with the applicable  fleet average standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each manufacturer must comply on an annual basis with the fleet  average standards as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers must report in their annual reports to the Agency  that they met the relevant corporate average standard by showing that  their sales-weighted average cold temperature NMHC emissions of LDV/ LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, as applicable, are at or below the applicable  fleet average standard;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the sales-weighted average is above the applicable fleet  average standard, manufacturers must obtain and apply sufficient NMHC  credits as permitted under paragraph (o)(8) of this section. A  manufacturer must show via the use of credits that they have offset any  exceedence of the corporate average standard. Manufacturers must also  include their credit balances or deficits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average cold  temperature NMHC standard for two consecutive years, the vehicles  causing the corporate average exceedence will be considered not covered  by the certificate of conformity (see paragraph (o)(8) of this section).  A manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle  basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> EPA will review each manufacturer's sales to designate the  vehicles that caused the exceedence of the corporate average standard.  EPA will designate as nonconforming those vehicles in test groups with  the highest certification emission values first, continuing until  reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of  noncomplying vehicles as determined above. In a group where only a  portion of vehicles would be deemed nonconforming, EPA will determine  the actual nonconforming vehicles by counting backwards from the last  vehicle produced in that test group. Manufacturers will be liable for  penalties for each vehicle sold that is not covered by a certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Requirements for the cold temperature NMHC averaging, banking  and trading (ABT) program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers must average the cold  temperature NMHC emissions of their vehicles and comply with the cold  temperature NMHC fleet average corporate standard. Manufacturers may  generate credits during and after the phase-in period. Manufacturers may  generate credits prior to the phase-in periods as described in paragraph  (o)(5) of this section. A manufacturer whose cold temperature NMHC fleet  average emissions exceed the applicable standard must complete the  calculation in paragraph (o)(4) of this section to determine the size of  its NMHC credit deficit. A manufacturer whose cold temperature NMHC  fleet average emissions are less than the applicable standard must  complete the calculation in paragraph (o)(4) of this section to generate  NMHC credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are no property rights associated with NMHC credits  generated under this subpart. Credits are a limited authorization to  emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in this part or any  other provision of law should be construed to limit EPA's authority to  terminate or limit this authorization through a rulemaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each manufacturer must comply with the reporting and  recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (p) of this section for NMHC  credits, including early credits. The averaging, banking and trading  program is enforceable through the certificate of conformity that allows  the manufacturer to introduce any regulated vehicles into commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credits are earned on the last day of the model year.  Manufacturers must   calculate, for a given model year, the number of credits or debits it  has generated according to the following equation, rounded to the  nearest 0.1 grams/mile:  NMHC Credits or Debits = (Cold Temperature NMHC Standard--Manufacturer's  Sales-Weighted Fleet Average Cold Temperature NMHC Emissions) x (Total  Number of Vehicles Sold)  Where:  Cold Temperature NMHC Standard = 0.3 grams/mile for LDV/LLDTs or 0.5</p><p class="depth3">grams/mile for HLDT/MDPV, per Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(2). Manufacturer's Sales-Weighted Fleet Average Cold Temperature NMHC</p><p class="depth3">Emissions = average calculated according to paragraph (m) of</p><p class="depth3">this section. Total Number of Vehicles Sold = Total 50-State sales based on the point</p><p class="depth3">of first sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following provisions apply for early banking:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers may certify LDV/LLDTs to the cold temperature NMHC  exhaust standards in Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(2) for model years 2008-2009 to  bank credits for use in the 2010 and later model years. Manufacturers  may certify HLDT/MDPVs to the cold temperature NMHC exhaust standards in  Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(2) for model years 2010-2011 to bank credits for use  in the 2012 and later model years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This process is referred to as ``early banking'' and the  resultant credits are referred to as ``early credits.'' To bank early  credits, a manufacturer must comply with all exhaust emission standards  and requirements applicable to LDV/LLDTs and/or HLDT/MDPVs. To generate  early credits, a manufacturer must separately compute the sales-weighted  cold temperature NMHC average of the LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs it  certifies to the exhaust requirements and separately compute credits  using the calculations in paragraph (o)(4) of this section. Early HLDT/ MDPV credits may not be applied to LDV/LLDTs before the 2010 model year.  Early LDV/LLDT credits may not be applied to HLDT/ MDPV before the 2012  model year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> NMHC credits are not subject to any discount or expiration date  except as required under the deficit carryforward provisions of  paragraph (o)(8) of this section. There is no discounting of unused  credits. NMHC credits have unlimited lives, subject to the limitations  of paragraph (o)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Credits may be used as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Credits generated and calculated according to the method in  paragraph (o)(4) of this section may be used only to offset deficits  accrued with respect to the standard in Sec. 86.1811-10(g)(2). Credits  may be banked and used in a future model year in which a manufacturer's  average cold temperature NMHC level exceeds the applicable standard.  Credits may be exchanged between the LDT/LLDT and HLDT/MDPV fleets of a  given manufacturer. Credits may also be traded to another manufacturer  according to the provisions in paragraph (o)(9) of this section. Before  trading or carrying over credits to the next model year, a manufacturer  must apply available credits to offset any credit deficit, where the  deadline to offset that credit deficit has not yet passed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of credits shall not be permitted to address Selective  Enforcement Auditing or in-use testing failures. The enforcement of the  averaging standard occurs through the vehicle's certificate of  conformity. A manufacturer's certificate of conformity is conditioned  upon compliance with the averaging provisions. The certificate will be  void ab initio if a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average  standard and does not obtain appropriate credits to cover its shortfalls  in that model year or in the subsequent model year (see deficit  carryforward provision in paragraph (o)(8) of this section).  Manufacturers must track their certification levels and sales unless  they produce only vehicles certified to cold temperature NMHC levels  below the standard and do not plan to bank credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The following provisions apply if debits are accrued:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a manufacturer calculates that it has negative credits (also  called ``debits'' or a ``credit deficit'') for a given model year, it  may carry that deficit forward into the next model year. Such a carry- forward may only   occur after the manufacturer exhausts any supply of banked credits. At  the end of that next model year, the deficit must be covered with an  appropriate number of credits that the manufacturer generates or  purchases. Any remaining deficit is subject to an enforcement action, as  described in this paragraph (o)(8). Manufacturers are not permitted to  have a credit deficit for two consecutive years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If debits are not offset within the specified time period, the  number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average cold temperature NMHC  standards (and therefore not covered by the certificate) must be  calculated by dividing the total amount of debits for the model year by  the fleet average cold temperature NMHC standard applicable for the  model year in which the debits were first incurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> EPA will determine the number of vehicles for which the  condition on the certificate was not satisfied by designating vehicles  in those test groups with the highest certification cold temperature  NMHC emission values first and continuing until reaching a number of  vehicles equal to the calculated number of noncomplying vehicles as  determined above. If this calculation determines that only a portion of  vehicles in a test group contribute to the debit situation, then EPA  will designate actual vehicles in that test group as not covered by the  certificate, starting with the last vehicle produced and counting  backwards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a manufacturer ceases production of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/ MDPVs, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for offsetting any  debits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to  offset the debits will be considered a violation of paragraph (o)(8)(i)  of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement  action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to  paragraphs (o)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with, or otherwise  combines with another manufacturer, the controlling entity is  responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required  time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a  violation of paragraph (o)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the  manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered  by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (o)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a  violation of the requirements of paragraph (o)(8)(i) of this section, a  failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued  and hence a sale of vehicles not covered by the certificate, all occur  upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting debits specified in  paragraph (o)(8)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The following provisions apply to NMHC credit trading:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a  transaction that a manufacturer could not cover by the reporting  deadline for the model year in which the trade occurred, both the buyer  and seller are liable, except in cases involving fraud. EPA may void ab  initio the certificates of conformity of all engine families  participating in such a trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A manufacturer may only trade credits that it has generated  pursuant to paragraph (o)(4) of this section or acquired from another  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Reporting and recordkeeping. Keep records and submit information  for demonstrating compliance with the fleet average cold temperature  NMHC standard as described in Sec. 86.1862-04.
