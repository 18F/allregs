                            <p class="depth0">This subpart explains what happens when you receive less or more than the correct amount of SVB than you are entitled to receive. Sections 408.901 through 408.903 define overpayment and underpayment and describe how we determine the amount of the overpayment or underpayment. When you receive less than the correct amount of SVB (which we refer to as an underpayment), we will take the actions described in Secs. 408.904 and 408.905. Waiver of recovery of overpayments (payments of more than the correct amount) is discussed in Secs. 408.910 through 408.914, and the methods we use to recover overpayments are discussed in Secs. 408.920 through 408.946. In Sec. 408.950, we explain when we will accept a compromise settlement of an overpayment or suspend or terminate collection of an overpayment.</p>
