                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and  expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant  and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position  of the Office or Division over which the applicant has prevailed was  substantially justified. The position of the Office or Division  includes, in addition to the position taken by the Office or Division in  the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Office  or Division upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden  of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing  applicant is on counsel for an Office or Division of the Commission,  which must show that its position was reasonable in law and fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly  or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances  make the award sought unjust.  [47 FR 610, Jan. 6, 1982, as amended at 54 FR 53051, Dec. 27, 1989]</p>
