                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You may assign any share of the costs to the BIG grant only if the  BIG-funded facility or a discrete element of the BIG-funded facility  benefits only eligible users. If a cost does not exclusively benefit  eligible users, you must allocate costs accordingly. A discrete element  has a distinct purpose, such as a fuel station, pumpout facility,  breakwater, or dock system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must clearly show and explain in the project statement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The anticipated benefits of each project, discrete elements, and  major components;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The breakdown of costs, as described at Sec.  86.43(i),  including the basis or method you use to allocate costs between eligible  and ineligible users; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your reasoning in determining how to allocate costs, based on  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and any other guidance in the  annual NOFO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After you submit the application, if we do not agree with your  cost allocation using paragraph (a) of this section, we will contact  you. We may ask you to clarify your information. If we do not agree that  the allocation is equitable, we may negotiate an equitable allocation.  We must be able to agree that you are appropriately allocating costs  between eligible and ineligible users based on the expected use before  we consider your application for award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a proposed BIG-funded facility, or a discrete element, minor  component, or single action of the BIG-funded project, gives a secondary  or minimal benefit to all users, we will not require you to allocate  costs between eligible and ineligible users for that benefit. Examples  of how we will apply this rule are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The primary purpose is to benefit eligible users directly, with  the secondary benefit for both eligible and ineligible users. You must  clearly state the exclusive benefit to eligible users in your  application. The secondary benefit cannot exclude eligible users from  the primary purpose. For example, if you construct a dock system for  exclusive use by eligible vessels and a secondary benefit of the dock  system is protection of the marina from wave action, you would not have  to allocate costs for the secondary benefit. However, the secondary  benefit cannot be docking for ineligible vessels because it would  exclude eligible users from the primary purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The secondary benefit to ineligible users is not the primary  purpose, is minimal, and you do not add special features to accommodate  ineligible users. For example, you do not have to allocate costs between  user groups for a gangway from the transient dock, designed exclusively  for eligible users, even though it is accessible to the general public.  However, if you construct the gangway to accommodate the expected  ineligible users, then you must allocate costs between user groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The expected benefits to both eligible and ineligible users have  minimal value. If the component has a value of .0025 percent or less  than the maximum available Federal award plus required match, you do not  have to allocate costs for that component. We will post the amount of  the minimal value each year in the annual NOFO. For example, if the  total maximum Federal award and required match for a BIG Tier 2-- National project is $2 million, you do not have to allocate costs  between user groups for any discrete project element, component, or  action with a value of $5,000 or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples of actions for which you must allocate costs between  user groups are the following, unless paragraph (b) of this section  applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You propose a 200-foot dock for eligible user tie-up spaces that  you attach to the shore at a boat launch. It will attract ineligible use  as a tie-up for boaters as they enter and exit the water. You must  allocate costs between the expected eligible and ineligible use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You propose a breakwater, fuel station, pumpout station,  restroom, dredging, navigational aids, or other multiuse or multipurpose  action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples of actions for which you do not need to allocate costs  between user groups are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You propose to construct, renovate, or maintain docks  specifically for eligible vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You propose to produce information and educational materials  specific to BIG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must clearly inform boaters when access by ineligible users  is limited or restricted following the guidance at Sec.  86.94.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We may ask you to clarify or change how you allocate costs in  your grant application if they do not meet our standards. We may reject  costs or applications that do not allocate costs between eligible and  ineligible users according to the requirements of this section and the  NOFO.</p>
