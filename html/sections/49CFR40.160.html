You must make this determination by  personally conducting, or causing to be conducted, a medical evaluation.  In addition, if appropriate, you may also consult with the employee's  physician to gather information you need to reach this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you do not personally conduct the medical evaluation, as the  MRO, you must ensure that one is conducted by a licensed physician  acceptable to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, the MRO or the physician  conducting the evaluation may conduct an alternative   test (e.g., blood) as part of the medically appropriate procedures in  determining clinical evidence of drug use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the medical evaluation reveals no clinical evidence of drug  use, as the MRO, you must report this to the employer as a negative test  result with written notations regarding the medical examination. The  report must also state why the medical examination was required (i.e.,  either the basis for the determination that a permanent or long-term  medical condition exists or because the recollection under direct  observation resulted in another invalid result for the same reason, as  appropriate) and for the determination that no signs and symptoms of  drug use exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Check ``Negative'' (Step 6) on the CCF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sign and date the CCF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the medical evaluation reveals clinical evidence of drug use,  as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a cancelled  test with written notations regarding the results of the medical  examination. The report must also state why the medical examination was  required (i.e., either the basis for the determination that a permanent  or long-term medical condition exists or because the recollection under  direct observation resulted in another invalid result for the same  reason, as appropriate) and state the reason for the determination that  signs and symptoms of drug use exist. Because this is a cancelled test,  it does not serve the purpose of an actual negative test result (i.e.,  the employer is not authorized to allow the employee to begin or resume  performing safety-sensitive functions, because a negative test result is  needed for that purpose).
