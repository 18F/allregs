                            <p class="depth0">Service of process on the Authorized Agent or his designee may be  made in person or by certified or registered mail, with return receipt  requested, at the address of the Authorized Agent. Service may also be  made on the Authorized Agent by means of any private delivery service  pursuant to its authority for the private carriage of letters under an  exception to the Private Express Statutes, 39 U.S.C. 601-606, provided  that the private delivery organization issues a receipt bearing the name  and address of both the addressee and sender, as well as the date of  delivery and the signature of the receiving agent. No garnishment is  effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent or his  designee regardless of the chosen mode of delivery. Process addressed  to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the  Authorized Agent or his designee, may, at the sole discretion of the  employee, be returned to the issuing court marked ``Not Effectively  Served.'' A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included.  Employees are not authorized to redirect or forward garnishment process  to the Authorized Agent. In the event that the address of the Authorized  Agent is changed, mail may be forwarded from his last published address  to his new official address until such time as these regulations are  amended to reflect the new address.</p>
