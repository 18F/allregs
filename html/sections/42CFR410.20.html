Medicare Part B pays for physicians'  services, including diagnosis, therapy, surgery, consultations, and  home, office, and institutional calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By whom services must be furnished.

Sec. 410.22 through  410.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior determination of medical necessity for physicians'  services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A ``Prior Determination of Medical  Necessity'' means an individual decision by a Medicare contractor,  before a physician's service is furnished, as to whether or not the  physician's service is covered consistent with the requirements of  section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act relating to medical necessity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ``eligible requester'' includes the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A participating physician (or a physician that accepts  assignment), but only with respect to physicians' services to be  furnished to an individual who is entitled to receive benefits under  this part and who has consented to the physician making the request  under this section for those physicians' services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An individual entitled to benefits under this part, but only  with respect to physicians' services for which the individual receives,  from a physician, an advance beneficiary notice under section 1879(a) of  the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rule. Each Medicare contractor will, through the  procedures established in CMS manual instructions, allow requests for  prior determinations of medical necessity from eligible requesters under  its respective jurisdiction for those services identified by CMS  (updated annually in conjunction   with the update to the MPFS and posted on that specific Medicare  contractor's Web site by the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System  procedure code and code description). Only those services listed on that  Medicare contractor's Web site on the date the request for a prior  determination is made are subject to prior determination. Each  contractor's list will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The national list, provided by CMS, of the most expensive  physicians' services (as defined in section 1848(j)(3) of the Act)  included in the MPFS which are performed at least 50 times annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The national list, provided by CMS, of plastic and dental  surgeries that may be covered by Medicare and that have an amount of at  least $1,000 on the MPFS (not including the adjustment for location by  the GPCI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Services with local coverage determinations (LCDs) or national  coverage determinations (NCDs). In instances where an LCD or an NCD  exists that has sufficiently specific reasonable and necessary criteria  addressing the particular clinical indication for the procedure for  which the prior determination is requested, the contractor will send a  copy of the LCD or NCD to the requestor along with an explanation that  the LCD or NCD serves as the prior determination and that no further  determination will be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identification of eligible services. CMS will identify the  number of services that are eligible for a prior determination through  manual instructions consistent with the criteria established in the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Statutory procedures. Under sections 1869(h)(3) through (h)(6)  of the Act, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Request for prior determination--(A) In general. An eligible  requester may submit to the contractor a request for a determination,  before the furnishing of a physician's service, as to whether the  physician's service is covered under this title consistent with the  applicable requirements of section 1862(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of the Act (relating to  medical necessity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(ii)</em> of the Act, the Secretary may require that the request  also be accompanied by a copy of the advance beneficiary notice  involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Response to request--(A) General rule. The contractor will  provide the eligible requester with written notice of a determination as  to whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> of the  Act relating to medical necessity); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The physician's service is not covered (the physician's service  is not covered consistent with the requirements of section 1862(a)(1)(A)  of the Act relating to medical necessity); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contractor lacks sufficient information to make a coverage  determination with respect to the physician's service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contents of notice for certain determinations--(1) Coverage. If  the contractor makes the determination described in paragraph  (d)(5)(ii)(A)(1) of this section, the contractor will indicate in the  prior determination notice that the physician service is covered  consistent with the requirements of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act  relating to medical necessity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, the contractor will  include in the notice a brief explanation of the basis for the  determination, including on what national or local coverage or  noncoverage determination (if any) the determination is based, and a  description of any applicable rights under section 1869(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section,  the contractor will include in the notice a description of the  additional information required to make the coverage determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Deadline to respond. The notice described in paragraphs  (d)(5)(ii)(A)(1) through (d)(5)(ii)(A)(3) of this section   will be provided by the contractor within 45 days of the date the  request for a prior determination is received by the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Informing beneficiary in case of physician request. In the case  of a request by a participating physician or a physician accepting  assignment, the process will provide that the individual to whom the  physician's service is to be furnished will be informed of any  determination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(2) of this section  (relating to a determination of non-coverage). The beneficiary will also  be notified that, notwithstanding the determination of non-coverage, the  beneficiary has the right to obtain the physician's service in question  and have a claim submitted for the physician's service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Binding nature of positive determination. If the contractor  makes the determination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(1) of this  section, that determination will be binding on the contractor in the  absence of fraud or evidence of misrepresentation of facts presented to  the contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation on further review--(A) General rule. Contractor  determinations described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(2) of this section  or paragraph (d)(5)(ii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(3)</em> of this section (relating to pre-service  claims) are not subject to administrative appeal or judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Decision not to seek prior determination or negative  determination does not impact the right to obtain services, seek  reimbursement, or appeal rights. Nothing in this paragraph will be  construed as affecting the right of an individual who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Decides not to seek a prior determination under this paragraph  with respect to physicians' services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, from receiving  (and submitting a claim for) those physicians' services and from  obtaining administrative or judicial review respecting that claim under  the other applicable provisions of this part 405 subpart I of this  chapter. Failure to seek a prior determination under this paragraph with  respect to physicians' services will not be taken into account in that  administrative or judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No prior determination after receipt of services. Once an  individual is provided physicians' services, there will be no prior  determination under this paragraph with respect to those physicians'  services.
