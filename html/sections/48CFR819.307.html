                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All protests relating to whether a Service-Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) is  a ``small'' business for the purposes of any Federal program are subject  to 13 CFR part 121 and must be filed in accordance with that part.  SDVOSB and VOSB status shall be determined in accordance with 38 CFR  part 74.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A contracting officer or an interested party may protest the  apparently successful offeror's SDVOSB or VOSB status. ``Interested  party'' for the purpose of filing a status protest is an actual offeror  whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a  contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All status protests shall be in writing and shall state all  specific grounds for the protest. Assertions that a protested concern is  not an SDVOSB or VOSB concern, without setting forth specific facts or  allegations, are insufficient. An interested party must submit its  status protest to the contracting officer by close of business on the  fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions) or by  close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the  contracting officer of the apparently successful offeror (in negotiated  acquisitions). An interested party must deliver their protest in person,  by electronic mail, by facsimile, by express delivery service, or by the  U.S. Postal Service within the applicable time period to the contracting  officer. Any status protest received after these time limits is  untimely. Any status protest received prior to bid opening or  notification of intended award, whichever applies, is premature and  shall be returned to the protester. Except for premature status  protests, the contracting officer must forward to the Director, Center  for Verification and Evaluation (CVE), any status protest received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Director, CVE, will notify the protester and the contracting  officer of the date the status protest was received by CVE and whether  the status protest will be processed or dismissed for lack of timeliness  or specificity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Director, CVE, will determine the SDVOSB or VOSB status of  the protested concern based upon the totality of circumstances within 21  business days after receipt of the status protest. If the Director, CVE,  does not contact the contracting officer within 21 business days, the  contracting officer may award the contract to the apparently successful  offeror, unless the contracting officer has granted the Director, CVE,  an extension. The contracting officer may award the contract after  receipt of a status protest if the contracting officer determines in  writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest. The  contracting officer shall document this determination for the contract  file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A denial decision by the Director, CVE, that is based on the  failure to meet any service-disabled Veteran or Veteran criterion as  defined in 38 CFR 74.1 is not subject to an appeal to the Executive  Director, Office of Small and   Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and is a final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Director, CVE, will notify the contracting officer, the  protester, and the protested concern of its determination. The  determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned on  appeal by the Executive Director, OSDBU. The determination may be sent  by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic  means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the Director, CVE, sustains an SDVOSB or VOSB status protest  and the contract has already been awarded, then the awarded contract  shall be deemed void ab initio and the contracting officer shall rescind  the contract and award the contract to the next SDVOSB or VOSB in line  for the award. The ineligible SDVOSB or VOSB concern shall not be  permitted to submit another offer as a SDVOSB or VOSB on a future SDVOSB  or VOSB procurement under this part, unless it successfully appeals the  determination of the Director, CVE, to the Executive Director, OSDBU, or  unless it applies for and receives verified SDVOSB or VOSB status in  accordance with 38 CFR part 74.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in subsection (f), the protestor or the  protested SDVOSB or VOSB concern may file an appeal of the status  protest determination with the Executive Director, OSDBU. The Executive  Director must receive the appeal no later than 5 business days after the  date of receipt of the status protest determination. The Executive  Director will dismiss any appeal received after the 5-day period.  ``Filing'' means a document is received by the Executive Director by  5:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on that day. Documents may be filed by  hand delivery, mail, commercial carrier, or facsimile transmission. Hand  delivery and other means of delivery may not be practicable during  certain periods due to, for example, security concerns or equipment  failures. The filing party bears the risk that the delivery method  chosen will not result in timely receipt by the Executive Director,  OSDBU. Submit appeals to: Executive Director, OSDBU (00VE), U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC  20420.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The appeal must be in writing. The appeal must identify the  status protest determination being appealed and must set forth a full  and specific statement as to why the decision was based on clear error  of fact or law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The party appealing the determination must provide notice of the  appeal to the contracting officer. The Executive Director will decide  all appeals under this subpart solely on a review of the evidence in the  written protest file, arguments made in the appeal petition and  response(s) filed thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The Executive Director will make a decision within 10 business  days of the receipt of the appeal, if practicable, and will base the  decision only on the information and documentation in the protest record  as supplemented by the appeal. The Executive Director will provide a  copy of the decision to the contracting officer and the protested SDVOSB  or VOSB concern. The Executive Director's decision, if received before  the award, will apply to the pending acquisition. If the Executive  Director decides in favor of the appealing party and the decision is  received after the award, the contracting officer may terminate the  contract or not exercise the next option. The Executive Director's  decision is the final decision. The decision may be sent by mail,  commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means.
