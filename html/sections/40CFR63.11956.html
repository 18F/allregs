                            <p class="depth0">You must operate a reliable and accurate vinyl chloride monitoring  system for detection of major leaks and identification of the general  area of the affected source where a leak is located. A vinyl chloride  monitoring system means a device which obtains air samples from one or  more points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples  with gas chromatography or, if you assume that all hydrocarbons measured  are vinyl chloride, analyzes the samples with infrared  spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an equivalent or alternative  method. You must operate the vinyl chloride monitoring system according  to a program that you develop for your affected source. You must submit  a description of the program to the Administrator within 45 days of your  compliance date, unless a waiver of compliance is granted by the  Administrator, or the program has been approved and the Administrator  does not request a review of the program. Approval of a program will be  granted by the Administrator provided the Administrator finds:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The location and number of points to be monitored and the  frequency of monitoring provided for in the program are acceptable when  they are compared with the number of pieces of equipment in vinyl  chloride service and size and physical layout of the affected source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It contains a definition of leak which is acceptable when  compared with the background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the  areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring  system. Measurements of background concentrations of vinyl chloride in  the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring  system are to be included with the description of the program. The   definition of leak for a given plant may vary among the different areas  within the plant and is also to change over time as background  concentrations in the plant are reduced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It contains an acceptable plan of action to be taken when a leak  is detected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It provides for an acceptable calibration and maintenance  schedule for the vinyl chloride monitoring system and portable  hydrocarbon detector. For the vinyl chloride monitoring system, a daily  span check must be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride  equal to the concentration defined as a leak according to paragraph (b)  of this section. The calibration must be done with either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in  sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 at 40 CFR part 61, appendix B,  and in accordance with section 10.1 of Method 106, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate  concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration  gas cylinder standard must have been certified by the manufacturer. The  manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each  cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than [5  percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation,  certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf  life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the  manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl  chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to  prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1  and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2  of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for  establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be  followed.</p>
