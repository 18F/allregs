                            <p class="depth0">The following steps shall be taken for each test:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Check the device(s) for removing water from the exhaust sample  and the sample filter(s). Remove any water from the water trap(s). Clean  and replace the filter(s) as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Set the zero and span points of the CO analyzer with the  electrical spanning network or with analytical gases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Achieve normal engine operating condition. The transient engine  or chassis dynamometer test is an acceptable technique for warm-up to  normal operating condition for the idle test. If the emission test is  not performed prior to the idle emission test, a heavy-duty engine may  be warmed up according to 40 CFR part 1065, subpart F. A light-duty  truck may be warmed up by operation through one Urban Dynamometer  Driving Schedule test procedure (see Sec. 86.115-78 and appendix I to  this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operate the warm engine at 2500 [50 rpm, or rated torque speed  for diesel-cycle engines, and zero load for a minimum of 30 seconds and  a maximum of 6 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the CVS sampling system is used, the following procedures  apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If bag samples are drawn, with the sample selector valves in the  standby position connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute  exhaust and dilution air sample collection systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps,  integrators, and the raw CO2 analyzer, as applicable. (The  heat exchanger of the constant volume sampler, if used, shall be running  at operating temperature before sampling begins.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set  the gas flow measuring devices to zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Operate the engine or vehicle at curb idle for 30[5 seconds with  the clutch disengaged or in neutral gear. A heavy-duty engine may also  be disconnected from the dynamometer, or the dynamometer may be shut  off.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Begin raw and dilute sampling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For bag sampling, sample idle emissions long enough to obtain a  sufficient bag sample, but in no case shorter than 60 seconds nor longer  than 6 minutes. Follow the sampling and exhaust measurements  requirements of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart F, for conducting the raw  CO2 measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> As soon as possible, transfer the idle test exhaust and dilution  air samples to the analytical system and process the samples according  to Sec. 86.1540-84. Obtain a stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on  all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection  phase of the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the raw exhaust sampling and analysis technique specified in  40 CFR part 1065 is used, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Warm up the engine or vehicle per paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section. Operate the engine or vehicle at the conditions specified in  paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Follow the sampling and exhaust measurement requirements of 40  CFR part 1065, subpart F. The idle sample shall be taken for 60 seconds  minimum, and no more than 64 seconds. The chart reading procedures of 40  CFR part 1065, subpart F, shall be used to determine the analyzer  response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the engine or vehicle stalls at any time during the test run,  the test is void.
