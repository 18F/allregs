If necessary, follow the manufacturer's instructions for initial start-up and basic operating adjustments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calibration curve. Develop a calibration curve for each range used as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero the analyzer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Span the analyzer to give a response of approximately 90 percent of full-scale chart deflection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent of full scale, repeat steps in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Record the response of calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of full-scale concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve shall be of fourth order or less, have five or fewer coefficients, and be of the form of equation (1) or (2). Include zero as a data point. Compensation for known impurities in the zero gas can be made to the zero-data point. The calibration curve must fit the data points within 2 percent of point or 1 percent of full scale, whichever is less. Equations (1) and (2) follow:
y = Ax\4\+Bx\3\+Cx\2\+Dx+E (1)y = x/(Ax\4\+Bx\3\+Cx\2\+Dx+E) (2)
where:
y = concentration.x = chart deflection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Option.

To determine if this criterion is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Perform a linear least-square regression on the data generated. Use an equation of the form y=mx, where x is the actual chart deflection and y is the concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the equation z=y/m to find the linear chart deflection (z) for each calibration gas concentration (y).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the linearity (%L) for each calibration gas by:
Percent L=(100)(z-x)/(Full-scale chart deflection)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than [2 percent for each data point generated. For each emission test, a calibration curve of the

form y=mx is to be used. The slope (m) is defined for each range by the spanning process.</p>
