The operator of  each FFV that receives unsorted, unprocessed fish from foreign catching  vessels (Activity Code 2) for processing or receives U.S.-harvested fish  from U.S. fishing vessels in a joint venture (Activity Code 4) must  maintain a daily joint venture log of the effort, catch and production  of its associated U.S. or foreign fishing vessels and the processing  vessel as modified by the regulations for the fishery in which the FFV  is engaged. This log is separate and in addition to the log required by  paragraph (d) of this section. The operator must maintain a separate log  for each fishery in which the FFV is engaged, on a daily and cumulative  basis, according to this section and in the format specified in the  instructions provided with the permit or other format authorized under  paragraph (i) of this section. Receipts of fish caught outside the EEZ  must be included.

The logs required by paragraphs (e)  through (g) of this section must be maintained separately for each  fishery (see table 2 to Sec. 600.502).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effort section (all of ``SECTION ONE'') of the daily logs  must be updated within 2 hours of the hauling or receipt time. The catch  or receipt by trawl or set (``SECTION TWO'') must be entered within 12  hours of the hauling or receipt time. The daily and cumulative total  catch or receipts (``SECTION TWO'') and the production portion  (``SECTION THREE'') of the log must be updated within 12 hours of the  end of the day on which the catch was taken. The date of catch is the  day and time (GMT) the gear is hauled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Entries for total daily and cumulative catch or receipt weights  (disposition ``C'' or ``M'') must be based on the most accurate method  available to the vessel, either scale round weights or factory weights  converted to round weights. Entries for daily and cumulative weights of  discarded or returned fish (disposition ``D'' or ``R'') must be based on  the most accurate method available to the vessel, either actual count,  scale round weight, or estimated deck weights. Entries for product  weights must be based on the number of production units (pans, boxes,  blocks, trays, cans, or bags) and the average weight of the production  unit, with reasonable allowances for water added. Allowances for water  added cannot exceed 5 percent of the unit weight. Product weights cannot  be based on the commercial or arbitrary wholesale weight of the product,  but must be based on the total actual weight of the product as  determined by representative samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must make all entries in indelible ink,  with corrections to be accomplished by lining out and rewriting, rather  than erasure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Alternative log formats. As an alternative to the use of the  specific formats provided, a Nation may submit a proposed log format for  FFV's of that Nation for a general type of fishery operation in a  fishery (i.e., joint venture operations) to the appropriate Regional  Administrator and the USCG commander (see tables 1 and 2 to  Sec. 600.502). With the agreement of the USCG commander, the Regional  Administrator may authorize the use of that log format for vessels of  the requesting Nation.
