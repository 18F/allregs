                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart applies to each program for which Federal financial  assistance is authorized under a law administered by OPM, including the  federally assisted programs listed in appendix A to this subpart. It  also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal  financial assistance extended under a program after the effective date  of this subpart pursuant to an application approved before that  effective date. This subpart does not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty  contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended  under a program before the effective date of this subpart, except when  the assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of an agency  whose responsibilities are now exercised by OPM;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary  under a program; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employment practices, under a program, of an employer,  employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described  in Sec. 900.404(c).  The fact that a program is not listed in appendix A to this subpart does  not mean, if title VI is otherwise applicable, that the program is not  covered. Other programs under statutes now in force or hereinafter  enacted may be added to appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In a program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form,  or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real  property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under that  property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance,  the nondiscrimination requirement of this subpart extends to a facility  located wholly or in part in that space.</p>
