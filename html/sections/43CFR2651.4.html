                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and  (b) may not select more than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 69,120 acres from land that, prior to January 17, 1969, has been  selected by, or tentatively approved to, but not yet patented to the  State under the Alaska Statehood Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 69,120 acres of land from the National Wildlife Refuge System;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 69,120 acres of land from the National Forest System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the extent necessary to obtain its entitlement, each eligible  village corporation shall select all available lands within the township  or townships within which all or part of the village is located, and  shall complete its selection from among all other available lands.  Selections shall be contiguous and, taking into account the situation  and potential uses of the lands involved, the total area selected shall  be reasonably compact, except where separated by lands which are  unavailable for selection. The total area selected will not be  considered to be reasonably compact if (1) it excludes other lands  available for selection within its exterior boundaries; or (2) lands  which are similar in character to the village site or lands ordinarily  used by the village inhabitants are disregarded in the selection  process; or (3) an isolated tract of public land of less than 1,280  acres remains after selection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The lands selected under sections 12(a) or (b) shall be in whole  sections where they are available, or shall include all available lands  in less than whole sections, and, wherever feasible, shall be in units  of not less than 1,280 acres. Lands selected under section 16(b) of the  Act shall conform to paragraph (b) of this section and shall conform as  nearly as practicable to the U.S. land survey system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Village corporation selections within sections 11 (a)(1) and  (a)(3) areas shall be given priority over regional corporation  selections for the same lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Village or regional corporations are not required to select  lands within an unpatented mining claim or millsite. Unpatented mining  claims and millsites shall be deemed to be selected, unless they are  excluded from the selection by metes and bounds or other suitable  description and there is attached to the selection application a copy of  the notice of location and any amendments thereto. If the village or  regional corporation selection omits lands within an unpatented mining  claim or millsite, this will not be construed as violating the  requirements for compactness and contiguity. If, during the selection  period, the excepted mining claims or millsites are declared invalid, or  under the State of Alaska mining laws are determined to be abandoned,  the selection will no longer be considered as compact and contiguous.  The corporation shall be required to amend its selection, upon notice  from the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management, to include  the lands formerly included in the mining claim or millsite. If the  corporation fails to amend its selection to include such lands, the  selection may be rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligible village corporations may file applications in excess of  their total entitlement. To insure that a village acquires its selection  in the order of its priorities, it should identify its choices  numerically in the order it wishes them granted. Such selections must be  filed not later than December 18, 1974, as to sections 12(a) or 16(b)  selections and December 18, 1975, as to section 12(b) selections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whenever the Secretary determines that a dispute exists between  villages over land selection rights, he shall accept, but not act on,  selection applications from any party to the dispute until the dispute  has been resolved in accordance with section 12(e) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Village or regional corporations may, but are not required to,  select   lands within pending Native allotments. If the village or regional  corporation selection omits lands within a pending Native allotment,  this will not be construed as violating the requirements for compactness  and contiguity. If, during the selection period, the pending Native  allotment is finally rejected and closed, the village or regional  corporation may amend its selection application to include all of the  land formerly in the Native allotment application, but is not required  to do so to meet the requirements for compactness and contiguity.
