                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), 2672, and  2675, a claim is deemed to have been presented when OPM receives from a  claimant, his or her authorized agent or legal representative, an  executed Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury or Death), or other  written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money  damages stating a sum certain (a specific dollar amount) for injury to  or loss of property, personal injury, or death alleged to have occurred  as a result of the incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All claims filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act as a result  of the alleged negligence or wrongdoing of OPM or its employees will be  mailed or delivered to the Office of the General Counsel, United States  Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415- 1300.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A claim must be presented to the Federal agency whose activities  gave rise to the claim. A claim that should have been presented to OPM,  but was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is  presented to OPM, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), as of the date the  claim is received by OPM. When a claim is mistakenly presented to OPM,  OPM will transfer the claim to the appropriate Federal agency, if  ascertainable, and advise the claimant of the transfer, or return the  claim to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A claimant whose claim arises from an incident involving OPM and  one or more other Federal agencies, will identify each agency to which  the claim has been submitted at the time the claim is presented to OPM.  OPM will contact all other affected Federal agencies in order to  designate the single agency that will investigate and decide the merits  of the claim. In the event a designation cannot be agreed upon by the  affected agencies, the Department of Justice will be consulted and will  designate an agency to investigate and determine the merits of the  claim. The designated agency will notify the claimant that all future  correspondence concerning the claim must be directed to that Federal  agency. All involved Federal agencies may agree to conduct their own  administrative reviews and to coordinate the results, or to have the  investigation conducted by the designated Federal agency. But, in either  event, the designated agency will be responsible for the final  determination of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this  section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency  action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C.  2675(a). Amendments must be in writing and signed by the claimant or his  or her authorized agent or legal representative. Upon timely filing of  an amendment to a pending claim, OPM will have 6 months in which to make  a final disposition of the claim as amended and claimant's option under  28 U.S.C. 2675 (a) will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of an  amendment.</p>
