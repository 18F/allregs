                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acknowledgements of requests. Upon receipt of a perfected request, the CFPB will assign to the request a unique tracking number. The CFPB will send an acknowledgement letter to the requester by mail or email within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request. The acknowledgment letter will contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable request tracking number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with section 1070.14(d) of this subpart, as well as the date when the requester may expect a response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A brief statement identifying the subject matter of the request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A confirmation, with respect to any fees that may apply to the request pursuant to Sec. 1070.22 of this subpart, that the requester has sought a waiver or reduction in such fees, has agreed to pay any and all applicable fees, or has specified an upper limit (of not less than $25) that the requester is willing to pay in fees to process the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination to grant or deny a request. (1) The officer designated in Sec. 1070.15(b) to this subpart, or his or her delegate, shall make initial determinations either to grant or to deny in whole or in part requests for records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The officer designated in Sec. 1070.15(b) to this subpart, or his or her delegate, shall make initial determinations either to grant or to deny in whole or in part requests for records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the request is granted in full or in part, and if the requester requests a copy of the records requested, then a copy of the records shall be mailed or emailed to the requester in the requested format, to the extent the records are readily producible in the requested format. The CFPB shall also send the requester a statement of the applicable fees, either at the time of the determination or shortly thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a request for inspection, the requester shall be notified in writing of the determination, when and where the requested records may be inspected, and of the fees incurred in complying with the request. The CFPB shall then promptly make the records available for inspection at the time and place stated, in a manner that will not interfere with CFPB's operations and will not exclude other persons from making inspections. The requester shall not be permitted to remove the records from the room where inspection is made. If, after making inspection, the requester desires copies of all or a portion of the requested records, copies shall be furnished upon payment of the established fees prescribed by Sec. 1070.22 of this subpart. Fees may be charged for search and review time as stated in Sec. 1070.22 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If it is determined that the request for records should be denied in whole or in part, the requester shall be notified by mail or by email. The letter of notification shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the exemptions relied upon in denying the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If technically feasible, indicate the amount of information deleted and the exemptions under which the deletion is made at the place in the record where such deletion is made (unless providing such indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption relied upon to deny such material);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Set forth the name and title or position of the responsible official;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Advise the requester of the right to administrative appeal in accordance with Sec. 1070.21 of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Specify the official or office to which such appeal shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it is determined, after a reasonable search for records, that no responsive records have been found to exist, the requester shall be notified in writing or by email. The notification shall also advise the requester of the right to administratively appeal the CFPB's determination that no responsive records exist (i.e., to challenge the adequacy of the CFPB's search for responsive records) in accordance with Sec. 1070.21 of this subpart. The response shall specify the official or office to which the appeal shall be submitted for review.</p>
