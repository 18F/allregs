                            <p class="depth0">The royalty rate for digital phonorecord deliveries where the  reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the  transmission which constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, as  specified in 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(C) and (D), is deferred for  consideration until the next digital phonorecord delivery rate  adjustment proceeding pursuant to the schedule set forth in Sec.  255.7;  provided, however, that any owner or user of a copyrighted work with a  significant interest in such royalty rate, as provided in 17 U.S.C.  803(a)(1), may petition the Librarian of Congress to establish a rate  prior to the commencement of the next digital phonorecord delivery rate  adjustment proceeding. In the event such a petition is filed, the  Librarian of Congress shall proceed in accordance with 17 U.S.C.  115(c)(3)(D), and all applicable regulations, as though the petition had  been filed in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 803(a)(1).
