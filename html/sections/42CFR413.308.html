After evaluating an SNF's request for prospectively determined payment rates, the contractor notifies the SNF in writing as to whether the SNF meets any of the eligibility criteria described in Sec. 413.304 and the timely election requirements

under Sec. 413.308(a). The contractor must notify the SNF of its initial and final determinations within 10 working days after it receives all the data necessary to make each determination. The contractor's determination is limited to one cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibition against revocation. An SNF may not revoke its request after it has received the initial determination of eligibility from the contractor and the cost reporting period has begun.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revocation by contractor. If an SNF is given tentative approval to receive a prospectively determined payment rate, and, after the start of the applicable cost reporting period, the contractor determines that the SNF does not meet the eligibility criteria, the contractor must revoke the prospectively determined payment option.</p>
