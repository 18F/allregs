A refiner must apply for a motor vehicle baseline for each refinery in order to generate credits under Sec. 80.535 and apply for a non-highway baseline for each refinery to use the provisions of Sec. 80.554 (a), (b), or (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The baseline must be sent to the following address: U.S. EPA--Attn: Nonroad Rule Diesel Fuel Baseline, Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (regular mail) or U.S. EPA, Attn: Nonroad Rule Diesel Fuel Baseline, Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005 (express mail).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A baseline application must be submitted for each refinery or import facility and include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A listing of the names and addresses of all refineries or import facilities owned by the company for which the refiner or importer is applying for a motor vehicle or non-highway baseline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For purposes of a motor vehicle baseline volume for use in determining early credits per Sec. 80.535(a) and (b) and for purposes of a non-highway baseline volume used in determining compliance with the provisions of Sec. 80.554(a) or (d), the baseline volume produced during the three calendar years beginning January 1, 2003, 2004, and 2005, as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of a motor vehicle baseline volume for use in determining early credits per Sec. 80.535(a) and (b) and for purposes of a non-highway baseline volume used in determining compliance with the provisions of Sec. 80.554(a) or (d), the baseline volume produced during the three calendar years beginning January 1, 2003, 2004, and 2005, as calculated under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of a motor vehicle baseline volume for use in determining early credits per Sec. 80.535(c) and for purposes of a non-highway baseline volume used in determining compliance with the provisions of Sec. 80.554(b), the baseline volumes produced during the three calendar years beginning January 1, 2006, 2007, and 2008, as calculated under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of a total diesel baseline volume for use in determining compliance with the provisions of Sec. 80.554(d), the baseline volumes of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced during the calendar years beginning January 1, 1998 and 1999 (per Sec.
