                            <p class="depth0">The ranking of the ``community-oriented connectivity'' benefits of  the Project will be based on documentation in support of the need for  services, benefits derived from the proposed services, characteristics  of the PFSA, local community involvement in planning and implementation  of the Project, and the level of experience of the management team. In  ranking applications the Agency will consider the following criteria  based on a scale of 100 possible points:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An analysis of the challenges of the following criteria, laid  out on a community-wide basis, and how the Project proposes to address  these issues (up to 50 points):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The economic characteristics;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational challenges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Health care needs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public safety issues;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The extent of the Project's planning, development, and support  by local residents, institutions, and Critical Community Facilities.  Documentation must include evidence of community-wide involvement, as  exemplified by community meetings, public forums, and surveys. In  addition, applicants should provide evidence of local residents'  participation in the Project planning and development (up to 40 points).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The level of experience and past success of operating broadband  systems for the management team. (up to 10 points)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In making a final selection among and between applications with  comparable rankings and geographic distribution, the Administrator may  take into consideration the characteristics of the PFSA. Only  information provided in the application will be considered. Applicants  should therefore specifically address each of the following criteria to  differentiate their applications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persistent poverty counties that will be served within the PFSA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Out-migration Communities that will be served within the PFSA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rurality of the PFSA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The speed of service provided by the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Substantially underserved trust areas that will be served within  the PFSA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Community members with disabilities that will be served within  the PFSA; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other additional factors that may be outlined in the NOFA.</p>
