                            <p class="depth0">Metallic frames, casings, and other enclosures of electric equipment that can become ``alive'' through failure of insulation or by contact with energized parts shall be grounded by methods approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary.


Sec. 77.701-1  Approved methods of grounding of equipment receiving powerfrom ungrounded alternating current power systems.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of grounding metallic frames, casings and other enclosures of equipment receiving power from ungrounded alternating current power systems, the following methods of grounding will be approved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A solid connection between the metallic frame; casing, or other metal enclosure and the grounded metallic sheath, armor, or conduit enclosing the power conductor feeding the electric equipment enclosed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A solid connection to metal waterlines having low resistance to earth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A solid connection to a grounding conductor extending to a low-resistance ground field; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any other method of grounding, approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary, which insures that there is no difference in potential between such metal enclosures and the earth.


Sec. 77.701-2  Approved methods of grounding metallic frames, casings, and other enclosures of electric equipment receiving power from a direct-current power system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following methods of grounding metallic frames, casings, and other enclosures of electric equipment receiving power from a direct-current power system with one polarity grounded will be approved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A solid connection to the grounded power conductor of the system; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any other method, approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary, which insures that there is no difference in potential between such metal enclosures and the earth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A method of grounding of metallic frames, casings, and other enclosures of electric equipment receiving power from a direct-current power system other than a system with one polarity grounded, will be approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary if the method insures that there is no difference in potential between such frames, casings, and other enclosures, and the earth.


Sec. 77.701-3  Grounding wires; capacity.</p><p class="depth0">Where grounding wires are used to ground metallic sheaths, armors, conduits, frames, casings, and other metallic enclosures, such grounding wires will be approved if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Where the power conductor used is No. 6 A.W.G., or larger, the cross-sectional area of the grounding wire is at least one-half the cross-sectional area of the power conductor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where the power conductor used is less than No. 6 A.W.G., the cross-sectional area of the grounding wire is equal to the cross-sectional area of the power conductor.


Sec. 77.701-4  Use of grounding connectors.</p><p class="depth0">If ground wires are attached to grounded power conductors, separate clamps, suitable for such purpose, shall be used and installed to provide a solid connection.</p>
