insurance wage base and the hospital insurance wage base, respectively, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Tier 1 tax.

See also Sec. 31.3221-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Computation. The employer tax is computed by multiplying the amount of the compensation with respect to which the employer tax is imposed by the rate applicable to such compensation, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section. The applicable rate is the rate in effect at the time the compensation is paid. For rules relating to the time of payment, see Sec. 31.3121(a)-2(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Computation.
