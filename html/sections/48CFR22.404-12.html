                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each time the contracting officer exercises an option to extend  the term of a contract for construction, or a contract that includes  substantial and segregable construction work, the contracting officer  must modify the contract to incorporate the most current wage  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a contract with an option to extend the term of the contract  has indefinite-delivery or indefinite-quantity construction  requirements, the contracting officer must incorporate the wage  determination incorporated into   the contract at the exercise of the option into task orders issued  during that option period. The wage determination will be effective for  the complete period of performance of those task orders without further  revision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contracting officer must include in fixed-price contracts a  clause that specifies one of the following methods, suitable to the  interest of the Government, to provide an allowance for any increases or  decreases in labor costs that result from the inclusion of the current  wage determination at the exercise of an option to extend the term of  the contract:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer may provide the offerors the opportunity  to bid or propose separate prices for each option period. The  contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a  result of the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at  the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract.  Generally, this method is used in construction-only contracts (with  options to extend the term) that are not expected to exceed a total of 3  years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer may include in the contract a separately  specified pricing method that permits an adjustment to the contract  price or contract labor unit price at the exercise of each option to  extend the term of the contract. At the time of option exercise, the  contracting officer must incorporate a new wage determination into the  contract, and must apply the specific pricing method to calculate the  contract price adjustment. An example of a contract pricing method that  the contracting officer might separately specify is incorporation in the  solicitation and resulting contract of the pricing data from an annually  published unit pricing book (e.g., the U.S. Army Computer-Aided Cost  Estimating System or similar commercial product), which is multiplied in  the contract by a factor proposed by the contractor (e.g., .95 or 1.1).  At option exercise, the contracting officer incorporates the pricing  data from the latest annual edition of the unit pricing book, multiplied  by the factor agreed to in the basic contract. The contracting officer  must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the  incorporation of the new or revised wage determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contracting officer may provide for a contract price  adjustment based solely on a percentage rate determined by the  contracting officer using a published economic indicator incorporated  into the solicitation and resulting contract. At the exercise of each  option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer will  apply the percentage rate, based on the economic indicator, to the  portion of the contract price or contract unit price designated in the  contract clause as labor costs subject to the provisions of the  Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. The contracting officer  must insert 50 percent as the estimated portion of the contract price  that is labor unless the contracting officer determines, prior to  issuance of the solicitation, that a different percentage is more  appropriate for a particular contract or requirement. This percentage  adjustment to the designated labor costs must be the only adjustment  made to cover increases in wages and/or benefits resulting from the  incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of  the option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contracting officer may provide a computation method to  adjust the contract price to reflect the contractor's actual increase or  decrease in wages and fringe benefits (combined) to the extent that the  increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by  the contractor as a result of incorporation of, a new or revised wage  determination at the exercise of the option to extend the term of the  contract. Generally, this method is appropriate for use only if contract  requirements are predominately services subject to the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute and the construction requirements are  substantial and segregable. The methods used to adjust the contract  price for the service requirements and the construction requirements  would be similar.
