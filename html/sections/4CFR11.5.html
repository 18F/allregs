Such revocation is not effective unless it is in writing and signed by the principal and until the written revocation is received by the Government Accountability Office. Upon notification of the death of the principal during the pendency of any matter involving representation of the principal by an attorney or other party, the Government Accountability Office will consider the representative's authority to have been automatically revoked.</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER B_GENERAL PROCEDURES</p>
