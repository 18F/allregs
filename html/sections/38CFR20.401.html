                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Merged appeal. If the administrative appeal is merged, the appellate decision on the merged appeal will constitute final disposition of the claimant's appellate rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal not merged. If the claimant does not authorize merger, normal appellate rights on the same issue are preserved, and the Chairman will assign the proceeding to a Member or panel of Members of the Board who did not make the decision on the administrative appeal. The period of time from the date of notification to the claimant of the administrative appeal to the date of the Board's decision on the administrative appeal is not chargeable to the claimant for purposes of determining the time limit for perfecting his or her separate appeal.
