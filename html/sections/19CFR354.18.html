                            <p class="depth0">If there is a final decision under Sec.  354.15 to impose sanctions, or if a charging letter is settled under Sec.  354.7(b), notice of the Secretary's decision or of the existence of a settlement will be published in the Federal Register. If a final decision is reached, such publication will be no sooner than 30 days after issuance of a final decision or after a motion to reconsider has been denied, if such a motion was filed. In addition, whenever the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade subjects a charged or affected party to a sanction under Sec.  354.3(a)(1), the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade also will provide such information to the ethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate bar associations or other professional associations and to any Federal agency likely to have an interest in the matter. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will cooperate in any disciplinary actions by any association or agency. Whenever the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade subjects a charged or affected party to a private letter of reprimand under Sec.  354.3(a)(5), the Secretary will not make public the identity of the violator, nor will the Secretary make public the specifics of the violation in a manner that would reveal indirectly the identity of the violator.
