                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For states, local governments and Indian tribes, certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., are provided to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual operating agencies (governmental department or agency), normally charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) proposal for each operating agency is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal-awards. Indirect costs include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requirements for development and submission of cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices IV, V and VI to this part.</p>
