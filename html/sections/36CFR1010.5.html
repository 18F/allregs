considered along with technical, financial, and other factors throughout the decision-making process. Most Trust projects have three distinct stages in the decision-making process:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conceptual or preliminary study stage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detailed planning or final decision stage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Implementation stage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental review will be integrated into the decision-making process of the Trust as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the conceptual or preliminary study stage, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator shall determine whether the proposed action or project is one which is categorically excluded under Sec. 1010.7, has been adequately reviewed in a previously prepared EA and/or EIS, or requires further NEPA review (i.e., an EA or an EIS).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the proposed action or project is not categorically excluded and has not been adequately reviewed in a previously prepared EA and/or EIS, then prior to the Trust's proceeding beyond the conceptual or preliminary study stage, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator must determine whether an EIS is required. When appropriate, prior to the determination as to whether an EIS is required, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator may initiate a public scoping process in order to inform such a determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the Trust shall initiate a public scoping process in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7. An EIS, if determined necessary, must be completed and circulated at the earliest point at which meaningful analysis can be developed for the proposed action or project and prior to the Trust's final approval of the proposed action or project.</p>
