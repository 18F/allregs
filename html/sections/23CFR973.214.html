                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of this section, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is no longer acceptable due to traffic interference. The BIA and the FHWA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop criteria to determine when a CMS is to be implemented for a specific federally or tribally owned IRR transportation system that is experiencing congestion. Either the tribe or the BIA, in consultation with the tribe, shall consider the results of the CMS in the development of the IRR transportation plan and the IRRTIP, when selecting strategies for implementation that provide the most efficient and effective use of existing and future transportation facilities to alleviate congestion and enhance mobility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements provided in Sec. 973.204, the CMS must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For those BIA or tribal transportation systems that require a CMS, consideration shall be given to strategies that reduce private automobile travel and improve existing transportation system efficiency. Approaches may include the use of alternate mode studies and implementation plans as components of the CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A CMS will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify and document measures for congestion (e.g., level of service);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the causes of congestion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include processes for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identify the anticipated benefits of appropriate alternative traditional and nontraditional congestion management strategies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Determine methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the multi-modal transportation system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Appropriately consider the following example categories of strategies, or combinations of strategies for each area:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transportation demand management measures;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Traffic operational improvements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Public transportation improvements;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> ITS technologies; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Additional system capacity.</p><p class="depth5">PARTS 974	999 [Reserved]</p>
