The employing agency must credit an employee with compensatory time off for creditable time in a travel status as provided in Sec. 550.1404. The agency may authorize credit in increments of one-

tenth of an hour (6 minutes) or one-quarter of an hour (15 minutes). Agencies must track and manage compensatory time off granted under this subpart separately from other forms of compensatory time off.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee must comply with his or her agency's procedures for requesting credit of compensatory time off under this section. Employees must file such requests within the time period required by the agency. An employee's request for credit of compensatory time off for travel may be denied if the request is not filed within the time period required by the agency.
