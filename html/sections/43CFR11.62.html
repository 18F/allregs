(1) An injury to a biological resource has resulted from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance if concentration of the substance is sufficient to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An injury to a biological resource has resulted from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance if concentration of the substance is sufficient to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cause the biological resource or its offspring to have undergone at least one of the following adverse changes in viability: death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction), or physical deformations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exceed action or tolerance levels established under section 402 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 342, in edible portions of organisms; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exceed levels for which an appropriate State health agency has issued directives to limit or ban consumption of such organism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The method for determining injury to a biological resource, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, shall be chosen based upon the capability of the method to demonstrate a measurable biological response. An injury can be demonstrated if the authorized official determines that the biological response under consideration can satisfy all of the following acceptance criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The biological response is often the result of exposure to oil or hazardous substances. This criterion excludes biological responses that are caused predominately by other environmental factors such as disturbance, nutrition, trauma, or weather. The biological response must be a commonly documented response resulting from exposure to oil or hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exposure to oil or hazardous substances is known to cause this biological response in free-ranging organisms. This criterion identifies biological responses that have been documented to occur in a natural ecosystem as a result of exposure to oil or hazardous substances. The documentation must include the correlation of the degree of the biological response to the observed exposure concentration of oil or hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exposure to oil or hazardous substances is known to cause this biological response in controlled experiments. This criterion provides a quantitative confirmation of a biological response occurring under environmentally realistic exposure levels that may be linked to oil or hazardous substance exposure that has been observed in a natural ecosystem. Biological responses that have been documented only in controlled experimental conditions are insufficient to establish correlation with exposure occurring in a natural ecosystem.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The biological response measurement is practical to perform and produces scientifically valid results. The biological response measurement must be sufficiently routine such that it is practical to perform the biological response measurement and to obtain scientifically valid results. To meet this criterion, the biological response measurement must be adequately documented in scientific literature, must produce reproducible and verifiable results, and must have well defined and accepted statistical criteria for interpreting as well as rejecting results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise provided for in this section, the injury determination must be based upon the establishment of a statistically significant difference in the biological response between samples from populations in the assessment area and in the control area. The determination as to what constitutes a statistically significant difference must be consistent with the quality assurance provisions of the Assessment Plan. The selection of the control area shall be consistent with the guidance provided in Sec. 11.72 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The biological responses listed in this paragraph have been evaluated and found to satisfy the acceptance criteria provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The authorized official may, when appropriate, select from this list to determine injury to fish and wildlife resources or may designate another response as the determiner of injury provided that the designated response can satisfy the acceptance criteria provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The biological responses are listed by the categories of injury for which they may be applied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Category of injury--death. Five biological responses for determining when death is a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Brain cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme activity. Injury has occurred when brain

ChE activity in a sample from the population has been inhibited by at least 50 percent compared to the mean for normal brain ChE activity of the wildlife species. These enzymes are in the nervous system of vertebrate organisms and the rate of ChE activity is associated with the regulation of nerve impulse transmission. This biological response may be used to confirm injury when anti-ChE substances, such as organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides, are suspected to have resulted in death to bird and mammal species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fish kill investigations. Injury has occurred when a significant increase in the frequency or numbers of dead or dying fish can be measured in accordance with the procedures for counting dead or dying fish contained in Part II (Fish-Kill Counting Guidelines) of ``Monetary Values of Freshwater Fish and Fish-Kill Counting Guidelines,'' American Fisheries Society Special Publication Number 13, 1982 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 11.18).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Wildlife kill investigations. Injury has occurred when a significant increase in the frequency or number of dead or dying birds or mammal species can be measured in a population sample from the assessment area as compared to a population sample from a control area. Wildlife kill investigations may be used when acute mortality has occurred to multiple wildlife species, or when detectable quantities of oil or hazardous substances have adherred to, bound to, or otherwise covered surface tissue, or had been ingested or inhaled by dead or dying bird or mammal species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In situ bioassay. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the total mortality and/or mortality rates between population samples exposed in situ to a discharge of oil or a release of hazardous substance and those in a control site. In situ caged or confined bioassay may be used to confirm injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have caused death to fish species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Laboratory toxicity testing. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the total mortality and/or mortality rates between population samples of the test organisms placed in exposure chambers containing concentrations of oil or hazardous substances and those in a control chamber. Published standardized laboratory fish toxicity testing methodologies for acute flow-through, acute static, partial-chronic (early life stage), and chronic (life cycle) toxicity tests may be used to confirm injury. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused death to the natural population of fish.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Category of injury--disease. One biological response for determining when disease is a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance has met the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fin erosion. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of occurrence of fin erosion (also referred to as fin rot) in a population sample from the assessment area as compared to a sample from the control area. Fin erosion shall be confirmed by appropriate histological procedures. Fin erosion may be used when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have caused the disease.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Category of injury--behavioral abnormalities. Two biological responses for determining when behavioral abnormalities are a result of the exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Clinical behavioral signs of toxicity. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of occurrence of clinical behavioral signs of toxicity in a population sample from the assessment area as compared to a sample from the control area. Clinical behavioral signs of toxicity are characteristic behavioral symptoms expressed by an organism in response to exposure to an oil or hazardous substance. The clinical behavioral signs of toxicity used shall be those that have been documented in published literature.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Avoidance. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of avoidance behavior in population samples of fish placed in testing chambers with equal access to water containing oil or a hazardous substance and the control water. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused avoidance to the natural populations of fish. This biological response may be used to confirm injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have resulted in avoidance behavior in fish species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Category of injury--cancer. One biological response for determining when cancer is a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance has met the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fish neoplasm. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of occurrence of the fish neoplasia when comparing population samples from the assessment area and a control area. Neoplasms are characterized by relatively autonomous growth of abnormal cells that by proliferation infiltrate, press upon, or invade healthy tissue thereby causing destruction of cells, interference with physiological functions, or death of the organism. The following type of fish neoplasia may be used to determine injury: liver neoplasia and skin neoplasia. The neoplasms shall be confirmed by histological procedures and such confirmation procedures may also include special staining techniques for specific tissue components, ultra-structural examination using electron microscopy to identify cell origin, and to rule out or confirm viral, protozoan, or other causal agents. Fish neoplasm may be used to determine injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have been the causal agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Category of injury--physiological malfunctions. Five biological responses for determining when physiological malfunctions are a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Eggshell thinning. Injury has occurred when eggshell thicknesses for samples for a population of a given species at the assessment area are thinner than those for samples from a population at a control area, or are at least 15 percent thinner than eggshells collected before 1946 from the same geographic area and stored in a museum. This biological response is a measure of avian eggshell thickness resulting from the adult bird having assimilated the oil or hazardous substance. This biological response may be used when the organochlorine pesticide DDT or its metabolites are suspected to have caused such physiological malfunction injury.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reduced avian reproduction. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the mean number of young fledged per active nest when comparing samples from populations in the assessment area and a control area. The fledging success (the number of healthy young leaving the nest) shall be used as the measurement of injury. Factors that may contribute to this measurement include egg fertility, hatching success, and survival of young. This biological response may be used when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have reduced the nesting success of avian species.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme inhibition. Injury has occurred when brain ChE activity in a sample from the population at the assessment area shows a statistically significant inhibition when compared to the mean activity level in samples from populations in a control area. These enzymes are in the nervous systems of vertebrate organisms and the rate of ChE activity is associated with the regulation of nerve impulse transmission. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of physiological malfunction injury to birds, mammals, and reptiles when anti-ChE substances, such as organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides, have been discharged or released.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) inhibition. Injury has occurred when the activity level of whole blood ALAD in a sample from the population of a given species at an

assessment area is significantly less than mean values for a population at a control area, and ALAD depression of at least 50 percent can be measured. The ALAD enzyme is associated with the formation of hemoglobin in blood and in chemical detoxification processes in the liver. This biological response is a measure of the rate of ALAD activity. This biological response may be used to determine injury to bird and mammal species that have been exposed to lead.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Reduced fish reproduction. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference in reproduction success between the control organisms and the test organisms can be measured based on the use of published standardized laboratory toxicity testing methodologies. This biological response may be used when the oil or hazardous substance is suspected to have caused a reduction in the reproductive success of fish species. Laboratory partial-chronic and laboratory chronic toxicity tests may be used. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused reduced reproductive success in the natural population of fish.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Category of injury--physical deformation. Four biological responses for determining when physical deformations are a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the injury acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Overt external malformations. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of overt external malformation, such as small or missing eyes, when comparing samples from populations of wildlife species from the assessment area and a control area. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of injury when such physical deformations are observed in wildlife species exposed to oil or hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Skeletal deformities. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of skeletal deformities, such as defects in growth of bones, when comparing samples from populations of wildlife species from the assessment area and a control area. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of injury when such physical deformations are observed in wildlife species exposed to oil or hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Internal whole organ and soft tissue malformation. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of malformations to brain, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs, as well as soft tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and vascular system, when comparing samples from populations of wildlife species in the assessment area and a control area. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of injury when such physical deformations are observed in wildlife species exposed to oil or hazardous substances.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Histopathological lesions. Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of tissue or cellular lesions when comparing samples from populations of wildlife species from the assessment area and a control area. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of injury when such physical deformations are observed in wildlife species exposed to oil or hazardous substances.</p>
