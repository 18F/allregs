For doors, if not specified, devices are to  be tested on a minimum 7 foot (2.1 m) wide door and maximum 20 foot (6.1  m) wide door.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If powered by a separate source of power, the power-input supply  terminals are to be connected to supply circuits of rated voltage and  frequency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An external entrapment protection device requiring alignment,  such as a photoelectric sensor, shall be provided with a means, such as  a visual indicator, to show proper alignment and operation of the  device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An operator using an external entrapment protection device,  upon detecting a fault or an obstruction in the path of a downward  moving door, shall initiate reversal and shall return the door to, and  stop the door at, the full upmost position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The door operator is not required to return the door to, and  stop the door at, the full upmost position when an inherent entrapment  circuit senses an obstruction during the upward travel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The door operator is not required to return the door to, and  stop the door at, the full upmost position when a control is actuated to  stop the door during the upward travel--but the door can not be moved  downward until the operator has reversed the door a minimum of 2 inches  (50.8 mm).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Current protection test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There shall be no damage to the  entrapment protection circuitry if low voltage field-wiring terminals or  leads are shortened or miswired to adjacent terminals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  an external entrapment protection device is to be connected to a door  operator or other source of power in the intended manner, after which  all connections to low voltage terminals or leads are to be reversed as  pairs, reversed individually, or connected to any low voltage lead or  adjacent terminal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Splash test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An external entrapment protection device  intended to be installed inside a garage 3 feet or less above the floor  shall withstand a water exposure as described in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section without resulting in a risk of electric shock and shall  function as intended. After exposure, the external surface of the device  may be dried before determining its functionality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> External entrapment protection devices are to be indirectly  sprayed using a hose having the free end fitted with a nozzle as  illustrated in figure 2 and connected to a water supply capable of  maintaining a flow rate of 5 gallons (19 liters) per minute as measured  at the outlet orifice of the nozzle. The water from the hose is to be  played, from all sides and at any angle against the floor under the  device in such a manner most likely to cause water to splash the  enclosure of electric components. However, the nozzle is not to be  brought closer than 10 feet (3.05 m) horizontally to the device. The  water is to be sprayed for 1 minute.

As a result of the test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There shall be no cracking or breaking of the part, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The part shall operate as intended or, if dislodged after the  test, is capable of being restored to its original condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Samples of the external entrapment protection device are to be  subjected to the Impact Test described in the Standard for Polymeric  Materials--   Use in Electrical Equipment Evaluations, UL 746C, 4th ed., dated  December 27, 1995, as incorporated by reference in paragraph (d) of this  section. The external entrapment protection device is to be subjected to  5 foot-pound (6.8 J) impacts. Three samples are to be tested, each  sample being subjected to three impacts at different points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each of three additional samples of a device exposed to outdoor  weather when the door is the closed position are to be cooled to a  temperature of minus 31.03.6 [deg]F (minus  35.02.0 [deg]C) and maintained at this temperature  for 3 hours. Three samples of a device employed inside the garage are to  be cooled to a temperature of 32.0 [deg]F (0.0 [deg]C) and maintained at  this temperature for 3 hours. While the sample is still cold, the  samples are to be subjected to the impact test described in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section.
