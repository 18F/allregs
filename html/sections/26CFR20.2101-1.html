                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of tax. Section 2101 imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of a nonresident who is not a citizen of the United States at the time of death. In the case of estates of decedents dying after November 10, 1988, the tax is computed at the same rates as the tax that is imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of a citizen or resident of the United States in accordance with the provisions of sections 2101(b) and (c). For the meaning of the terms resident, nonresident, and United States, as applied to a decedent for purposes of the estate tax, see Sec. 20.0-1(b)(1) and (2). For the liability of the executor for the payment of the tax, see section 2002. For special rules as to the phaseout of the graduated rates and unified credit, see sections 2001(c)(2) and 2101(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rates in the case of certain decedents. In the case of an estate of a nonresident who was not a citizen of the United States and who died after December 31, 1976, and on or before November 10, 1988, the tax on the nonresident's taxable estate is computed using the formula provided under section 2101(b), except that the rate schedule in paragraph (c) of this section is to be used in lieu of the rate schedule in section 2001(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rate schedule for decedents dying after December 31, 1976 and on or before November 10, 1988.
