                            <p class="depth0">Fifty percent of any civil penalty resulting from activities under a  delegation of authority shall be shared with the delegated State.  However, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be deducted from  any Federal funding owed under a delegation of authority under the  provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1735. ONRR shall maintain records of civil  penalties collected and distributed to the States involved in 30 U.S.C.  1735 delegations. Each quarterly payment will be reduced by the amount  of the civil penalties paid to the delegated State or tribe during the  prior quarter.  [49 FR 37351, Sept. 21, 1984.
