When applied to nuclear power plants licensed pursuant to 10 CFR part 50, dedicating entity means the organization that performs the dedication process. Dedication may be performed by the manufacturer of

the item, a third-party dedicating entity, or the licensee itself.

This assurance is achieved by identifying the critical characteristics of the item and verifying their acceptability by inspections, tests, or analyses performed by the purchaser or third-party dedicating entity after delivery, supplemented as necessary by one or more of the following: commercial grade surveys; product inspections or witness at holdpoints at the manufacturer's facility, and analysis of historical records for acceptable performance. In all cases, the dedication process must be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 50, appendix B.
