                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State Directors are authorized to comment directly on EIS's prepared by other Federal agencies. In so doing, comments should be as specific as possible. Any recommendations for the development of additional information or analyses should indicate why there is a need for the material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comments should concentrate on those matters of primary importance to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and on areas of Agency expertise, such as rural planning and development. Any potential conflicts with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 programs, plans, or actions should be clearly identified. Special attention should be given to the relationship of the alternatives under study to the State Office's natural resource management guide and the objectives of the Department's land use regulation (exhibit A of this subpart). Copies of comments addressing land use questions will be provided to the appropriate chairman of the USDA State-level committee dealing with land use matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever a State Director has serious concerns over the acceptability of the anticipated environmental impacts, the State Director will notify the Administrator.</p>
