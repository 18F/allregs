                                Sec. 825.121  Leave for adoption or foster care.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave for  placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster  care as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employees may take FMLA leave before the actual placement or  adoption of a child if an absence from work is required for the  placement for adoption or foster care to proceed. For example, the  employee may be required to attend counseling sessions, appear in court,  consult with his or her attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth  parent, submit to a physical examination, or travel to another country  to complete an adoption. The source of an adopted child (e.g., whether  from a licensed placement agency or otherwise) is not a factor in  determining eligibility for leave for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee's entitlement to leave for adoption or foster care  expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the  placement. If state law allows, or the employer permits, leave for  adoption or foster care to be taken beyond this period, such leave will  not qualify as FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.701 regarding non-FMLA leave  which may be available under applicable State laws. Under this section,  the employee is entitled to FMLA leave even if the adopted or foster  child does not have a serious health condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the  same covered employer may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of  leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken for the placement  of the employee's son or daughter or to care for the child after  placement, for the birth of the employee's son or daughter or to care  for the child after birth, or to care for the employee's parent with a  serious health condition. This limitation on the total weeks of leave  applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as the spouses  are employed by the same employer. It would apply, for example, even  though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of an  employer located more than 75 miles from each other, or by two different  operating divisions of the same company. On the other hand, if one  spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled  to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where spouses both use a portion of  the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a  child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care for a  parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the  amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for  other purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to  care for a healthy, newly placed child, each could use an additional six  weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for a  child with a serious health condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA leave in order to care  for an adopted or foster child with a serious health condition if the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 825.113 through 825.115 and 825.122(d) are  met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if needed to  care for an adopted or foster child with a serious health condition,  even if both are employed by the same employer, provided they have not  exhausted their entitlements during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An eligible  employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after the  placement of a   healthy child for adoption or foster care only if the employer agrees.  Thus, for example, the employer and employee may agree to a part-time  work schedule after the placement for bonding purposes. If the employer  agrees to permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the  placement for adoption or foster care, the employer may require the  employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or  reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position  for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates  recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position.  Transfer to an alternative position may require compliance with any  applicable collective bargaining agreement, federal law (such as the  Americans with Disabilities Act), and State law. Transfer to an  alternative position may include altering an existing job to better  accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave. The  employer's agreement is not required for intermittent leave required by  the serious health condition of the adopted or foster child. See  Sec. Sec. 825.202-825.205 for general rules governing the use of  intermittent and reduced schedule leave. See Sec. 825.120 for general  rules governing leave for pregnancy and birth of a child. See Sec.  825.601 for special rules applicable to instructional employees of  schools. See Sec. 825.802 for special rules applicable to airline  flight crew employees.
