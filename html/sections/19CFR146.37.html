                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance of admission documentation. The operator shall  maintain either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lot file. The operator shall open and maintain a lot file  containing a copy of the Customs Form 214, the examination invoice, and  all other documentation necessary to account for the merchandise covered  by each Customs Form 214. The lot file will be maintained in sequential  order by using the unique number assigned to each Customs Form 214 as  the file reference number; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized inventory method. Where a Customs authorized  inventory method other than a lot system (specific identification of  merchandise) is used, e.g., First-In-First-Out (FIFO), no lot file is  required but the operator shall maintain a file of all Customs Form's  214 in sequential order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examination invoice. The operator shall give a copy of the  examination invoice to the person making entry to transfer the  merchandise from the zone upon request of that person or the port  director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability for merchandise. The operator will be held liable  under its bond for the receipt of merchandise admitted in the quantity  and condition as   described on the Customs Form 214, except as modified by a discrepancy  report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Signed jointly by the operator and carrier on the Customs Form  214 or other approved form within 15 days after admission of the  merchandise, and reported to the port director within 2 working days  thereafter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitted on Customs Form 5931 under the provisions of subpart  A, part 158, of this chapter within 20 days after admission of the  merchandise. The operator may file a Customs Form 5931 on behalf of the  person who applied for admission of merchandise to the zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Supervision of merchandise. The port director may authorize the  receipt of zone status merchandise at a zone without physical  supervision by a Customs officer (see Sec. 146.3). In that case, the  operator shall supervise the receipt of merchandise into the zone,  report the receipt and condition of the merchandise, and mark packages  with the unique Customs Form 214 number so that the merchandise can be  traced to a particular Customs Form 214. Packages that are accounted for  under a Customs-authorized inventory method other than specific  identification, need not be marked with a unique Customs Form 214 number  but must be adequately identified so Customs can conduct an inventory  count. The operator shall submit the Custom Form 214 to Customs at the  location specified by the port director.</p>
