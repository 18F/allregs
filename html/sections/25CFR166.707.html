                            <p class="depth0">A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the permittee files an appeal under Sec. 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with Sec. 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of cancellation from us.</p>
