                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part sets forth policies and procedures for loan of Army materiel. As used in this regulation, the term ``loan'' includes a lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) This regulation applies to all Department of the Army (DA) agencies, commands, installations, and activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This regulation applies to all Department of the Army (DA) agencies, commands, installations, and activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This regulation applies to the Army National Guard (ARNG) only when the procedure for the loan of equipment under the procedure of National Guard Regulation (NGR) 735-12 does not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the DOD Military Assistance and Sales Manual, DOD 5105.38-M.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This regulation does not apply to loans governed by the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This part outlines when loans of Army materiel may be made. It gives general procedures for requesting and processing loans, and sets forth

responsibilities, including requirements for reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Explanation of terms. (1) The terms ``loan,'' ``lease'' and ``bailment'' are contractual terms and are frequently used interchangeably. They have no meaning by themselves. It is necessary to study the statute to see what is required. Usually, a ``loan'' is thought of as a short-term transfer of property, sometimes with reimbursement; a ``lease'' is a more formal transfer, often long-term and requiring a fair monetary rental; and a ``bailment'' is a loosely-used term, generally reserved for a delivery of property to another in trust for the purpose of doing something to the property and then returning the property to the owner. The term ``issue'' is frequently used in the sense of a transfer of property which will be consumed in use. The terms ``gift,'' meaning a permanent transfer of property without reimbursement, and ``sale,'' meaning a permanent transfer with reimbursement, are outside the scope of this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms ``loan,'' ``lease'' and ``bailment'' are contractual terms and are frequently used interchangeably.
