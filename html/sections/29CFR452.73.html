                            <p class="depth0">In the interest of fair union elections, section 401(g) of the Act  places two limitations upon the use of labor organization funds derived  from dues, assessments, or similar levy. These limitations are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No such funds may be contributed or applied to promote the  candidacy of any person in an election subject to title IV, either in an  election within the organization expending the funds or in any other  labor organization; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No such funds may be used for issuing statements involving  candidates in the election.  This section is not intended to prohibit a union from assuming the cost  of distributing to the membership on an equal basis campaign literature  submitted to the union by the candidates pursuant to the rights granted  by section 401(c), as previously discussed, nor does it prohibit the  expenditure of such funds for notices, factual statements of issues not  involving candidates, and other expenses necessary for the holding of  the election.</p>
