                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. No person may offer for transportation or transport a lighter (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) containing a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material except under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lighter must contain a fuel reservoir not exceeding 4 fluid ounces capacity (7.22 cubic inches), and must contain not more than 10 grams (0.35 ounce) of flammable gas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum filling density may not exceed 85 percent of the volumetric

capacity of each fluid reservoir at 15 C (59 F).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each lighter design, including closures, must be capable of withstanding, without leakage or rupture, an internal pressure of at least two times the pressure of the flammable gas at 55 C (131 F).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each appropriate lighter design must be examined and successfully tested by a person or agency (authorized testing agency) who is authorized by the Associate Administrator to perform such examination and testing under the provisions of subpart E of part 107 of this chapter and who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has the equipment necessary to perform the testing required to the level of accuracy required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is able to demonstrate, upon request, the knowledge of the testing procedures and requirements of the HMR relative to lighters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not manufacture or market lighters, is not financially dependent or owned in whole or in part, by any entity that manufactures or markets lighters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is a resident of the United States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Performs all examination and testing in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Associate Administrator will assign an identification code to each person who is authorized to examine and test lighters. This identification code must be incorporated into a unique test report identifier for each successfully tested lighter design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examination and testing of lighter design types--(1) Lighter design type definition. A new lighter design is one that has never been examined and tested or one that differs from a previous design in any manner that may affect the escape (leakage) of gas. Lighter characteristics that may affect the escape of gas include changes in materials of construction, ignition mechanism, burner valve design, wall thickness, sealing materials, and type of fuel (e.g., vapor pressure differences).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lighter design type definition. A new lighter design is one that has never been examined and tested or one that differs from a previous design in any manner that may affect the escape (leakage) of gas. Lighter characteristics that may affect the escape of gas include changes in materials of construction, ignition mechanism, burner valve design, wall thickness, sealing materials, and type of fuel (e.g., vapor pressure differences).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lighter samples submitted for examination and testing. Samples of a new lighter design are excepted from the requirements of (a)(4) and (d) of this section and may be offered for transportation and transported under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The samples must be transported only to an authorized testing agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 12 lighters may be packaged in a single outer packaging;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inner packagings must conform to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For transportation by aircraft, intermediate or outer packagings must meet the pressure differential requirements of Sec. 173.27(c) of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The outer packaging must conform to the requirements of subpart M of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group I performance level and to the requirements of Sec. 173.24 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The word ``sample'' must appear on the shipping paper as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In addition to other required markings and labels, the package must be marked ``SAMPLE FOR EXAMINATION AND TESTING.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All other applicable requirements of this subchapter must be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examination and testing of sample lighters by an authorized testing agency. Each sample lighter must be examined for conformance with paragraph (a) of this section by a person authorized by the Associate Administrator. In addition, lighters must be subjected to the following leakage test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A minimum of six lighters must be examined and tested at one time. Store the lighters in a desiccator for 24 hours. After drying, weigh each lighter on an analytical balance capable of accurately measuring to within \1/10\ of a milligram (0.0001 grams).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After weighing, place the lighters together in an explosion-proof, controlled-temperature laboratory oven capable of maintaining 38 [1 C (100 [2 F) for 96 continuous hours (4 days). At the end of 96 hours, remove the lighters from the oven and place them in the same desiccator and allow the lighters to cool to ambient temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After cooling, weigh each lighter and determine the net weight differences for each lighter tested (subtract the mass after oven exposure from the original mass before oven exposure).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Weight losses must be assessed to determine the quantity of gas that leaked from the lighters and from the weight change as a result of absorbed moisture. If the net weight has increased, the test facility must run the required test using six empty lighters in parallel with the six filled lighters. The parallel tests are conducted to determine the weight of moisture absorbed in the plastic in order to determine the weight loss of the lighters from gas leakage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the net weight loss for any one of the six lighters exceeds 20 milligrams (0.020 grams), the design must be rejected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Lighters manufactured to a rejected lighter design may not be offered for transportation or transported in commerce unless approved in writing by the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recordkeeping requirements. (i) Following the examination of each new lighter design, the person or agency that conducted the examination and test must prepare a test report and make that test report available to the manufacturer. At a minimum, the test report must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Following the examination of each new lighter design, the person or agency that conducted the examination and test must prepare a test report and make that test report available to the manufacturer.
