                                Sec. 794.120  Meaning of ``annual gross volume of sales.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The annual gross volume of sales of an enterprise consists of its  gross receipts from all types of sales during a 12-month period (Sec.  794.122). The gross volume derived from all sales transactions is  included, and will embrace among other things receipts from service,  credit, or similar charges. However, credits for goods returned or  exchanged (as distinguished from ``trade-ins''), rebates, discounts, and  the like   are not ordinarily included in the annual gross volume of sales. In  determining whether the million dollar limit on annual gross sales  volume is or is not exceeded, the sales volume from all the related  activities which constitute the enterprise must be included; the dollar  volume of the entire business in all establishments is added together.  Thus, the gross volume of sales will include the receipts from sales  made by any gasoline service stations of the enterprise, as well as the  sales made by any other establishments of the enterprise. These  principles and their application are considered in more detail in parts  776 and 779 of this chapter, which contain general discussions of  ``annual gross volume'' as used in other provisions of the Act.</p>
