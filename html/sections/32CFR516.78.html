Purpose</p><p class="depth0">Under Section 301 reference (a) and reference (b), this Directive establishes policy,

assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the release of official DoD information in litigation and for testimony by DoD personnel as witnesses during litigation.</p><p class="depth0">B. Applicability and Scope</p><p class="depth0">1. This Directive applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (OJCS), the Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to as ``DoD Components''), and to all personnel of such DoD Components.</p><p class="depth0">2. This Directive does not apply to the release of official information or testimony by DoD personnel in the following situations:</p><p class="depth0">a. Before courts-martial convened by the authority of the Military Departments or in administrative proceedings conducted by or on behalf of a DoD Component;</p><p class="depth0">b. Pursuant to administrative proceedings conducted by or on behalf of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), or pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement to which the Government is a party;</p><p class="depth0">c. In response to requests by Federal Government counsel in litigation conducted on behalf of the United States;</p><p class="depth0">d. As part of the assistance required in accordance with the Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Program under DoD Directive 5220.6 (reference (c)); or</p><p class="depth0">e. Pursuant to disclosure of information to Federal, State, and local prosecuting and law enforcement authorities, in conjunction with an investigation conducted by a DoD criminal investigative organization.</p><p class="depth0">3. This Directive does not supersede or modify existing laws or DoD programs governing the testimony of DoD personnel or the release of official DoD information during grand jury proceedings, the release of official information not involved in litigation, or the release of official information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 (reference (a)) or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a (reference (a)), nor does this Directive preclude treating any written request for agency records that is not in the nature of legal process as a request under the Freedom of Information or Privacy Acts.</p><p class="depth0">4. This Directive is not intended to infringe upon or displace the responsibilities committed to the Department of Justice in conducting litigation on behalf of the United States in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth0">5. This Directive does not preclude official comment on matters in litigation in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth0">6. This Directive is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operation of the Department of Defense and is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law against the United States or the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">C. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand. Subpoena, order, or other demand of a court of competent jurisdiction, or other specific authority for the production, disclosure, or release of official DoD information or for the appearance and testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses.</p><p class="depth0">2. DoD Personnel. Present and former U.S. military personnel; Service Academy cadets and midshipmen; and present and former civilian employees of any Component of the Department of Defense, including nonappropriated fund activity employees; non-U.S. nationals who perform services overseas, under the provisions of status of forces agreements, for the United States Armed Forces; and other specific individuals hired through contractual agreements by or on behalf of the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0">3. Litigation. All pretrial, trial, and post-trial stages of all existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before civilian courts, commissions, boards (including the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals), or other tribunals, foreign and domestic. This term includes responses to discovery requests, depositions, and other pretrial proceedings, as well as responses to formal or informal requests by attorneys or others in situations involving litigation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Official Information. All information of any kind, however stored, that is in the custody and control of the Department of Defense, relates to information in the custody and control of the Department, or was acquired by DoD personnel as part of their official duties or because of their official status within the Department while such personnel were employed by or on behalf of the Department or on active duty with the United States Armed Forces.</p><p class="depth0">D. Policy</p><p class="depth0">It is DoD policy that official information should generally be made reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">E. Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">1. The General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DoD), shall provide general policy and procedural guidance by the issuance of supplemental instructions or specific orders concerning the release of official DoD information in litigation and the testimony of

DoD personnel as witnesses during litigation.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Heads of DoD Components shall issue appropriate regulations to implement this Directive and to identify official information that is involved in litigation.</p><p class="depth0">F. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">1. Authority To Act</p><p class="depth0">a. In response to a litigation request or demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses, the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments; and the Chief Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with regard to their respective Components, are authorized--after consulting and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation attorneys, as required--to determine whether official information originated by the Component may be released in litigation; whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such release, interview, contact, or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to invoke appropriate claims of privilege before any tribunal, is permitted.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request or demand for official information originated by another Component, the receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the request or demand to the originating Component for action in accordance with this Directive. The receiving Component shall also notify the requestor, court, or other authority of its transfer of the request or demand.</p><p class="depth0">c. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs F.1.a. and b., the GC, DoD, in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, intelligence means or sources, or otherwise as deemed necessary, may notify Components that GC, DoD, will assume primary responsibility for coordinating all litigation requests and demands for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel, or both; consulting with the Department of Justice, as required; and taking final action on such requests and demands.</p><p class="depth0">2. Factors To Consider</p><p class="depth0">In deciding whether to authorize the release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel concerning official information (hereinafter referred to as ``the disclosure'') pursuant to paragraph F.1., DoD officials should consider the following types of factors:</p><p class="depth0">a. Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules;</p><p class="depth0">b. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the request or demand arose;</p><p class="depth0">c. Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive;</p><p class="depth0">d. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;</p><p class="depth0">e. Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DoD Information Security Program under DoD 5200.1-R (reference (d)), unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25 (reference (e)), or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and</p><p class="depth0">f. Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">3. Decisions on Litigation Requests and Demands</p><p class="depth0">a. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel shall not, in response to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the prior written approval of the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such approval shall be made and retained in accordance with the applicable implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">b. If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual seeking such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and relevance of the official information sought. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved by the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</p><p class="depth0">c. Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD personnel for official DoD information or for testimony concerning such information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall immediately notify the DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. for the Component to which

the individual contacted is or, for former personnel, was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of Justice of the request or demands. After due consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the DoD official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the request or demand and shall notify the requestor or the court or other authority of the determination reached.</p><p class="depth0">d. If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD official in accordance with paragraph F.3.c., a response to the request or demand is required before instructions from the responsible official are received, the responsible official designated in paragraph F.1. shall furnish the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of this Directive and applicable implementing regulations, inform the requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the request or demand pending a final determination by the Component concerned.</p><p class="depth0">e. If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority declines to stay the effect of the request or demand in response to action taken pursuant to paragraph F.3.d., or if such court or other authority orders that the request or demand must be complied with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, the DoD personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order. If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's ruling or order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</p><p class="depth0">4. Fees</p><p class="depth0">Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7 (reference (f)), the appropriate officials designated in paragraph F.1. are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited by law, to parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not otherwise available under the DoD Freedom of Information Act Program (reference (g)). Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse the Government for the expense of providing such information, may include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and respond to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any information located in response thereto and for related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340 (1978).</p><p class="depth0">5. Expert or Opinion Testimony</p><p class="depth0">DoD personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice. Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear and testify at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of competent jurisdiction, or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).</p><p class="depth0">G. Effective Date and Implementation</p><p class="depth0">This Directive is effective immediately.

Reissuance and Purpose</p><p class="depth0">This Directive reissues reference (a) to update policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the coordination of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies stemming from investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities. More effective and timely communication of information developed during such investigations will enable the Department of Defense to take the most appropriate of the available measures.</p><p class="depth0">B. Applicability</p><p class="depth0">This Directive applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD); the Military Departments; the Defense Agencies; and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as ``DoD Components'').</p><p class="depth0">C. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. DoD Criminal Investigative Organizations. Refers to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command; the Naval Investigative Service Command; the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations; and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Office of the IG, DoD (OIG, DoD).</p><p class="depth0">2. Significant. Refers to all fraud cases involving an alleged loss of $100,000, or more; all corruption cases related to procurement that involved bribery, gratuities, or conflicts of interest; and any investigation into defective products or product substitution in which a SERIOUS HAZARD to health, safety, or operational readiness is indicated, regardless of loss value.</p><p class="depth0">D. Policy</p><p class="depth0">It is DoD policy that:</p><p class="depth0">1. Each of the DoD Components shall monitor, from its inception, all significant investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities affecting its organizations, for the purpose of ensuring that all possible criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies in such cases are identified to cognizant procurement and command officials and that appropriate remedies are pursued expeditiously. This process shall include appropriate coordination with all other affected DoD Components.</p><p class="depth0">2. All investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities shall be reviewed to determine and implement the appropriate contractual and administrative actions that are necessary to recover funds lost through fraud or corruption and to ensure the integrity of DoD programs and operations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Appropriate civil, contractual, and administrative actions, including those set forth in enclosure 1, shall be taken expeditiously. During an investigation and before prosecution or litigation, and when based in whole or in part on evidence developed during an investigation, such actions shall be taken with the advance knowledge of the responsible DoD criminal investigative organization and, when necessary, the appropriate legal counsel in the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice (DoJ). When appropriate, such actions shall be taken before final resolution of the criminal or civil case.</p><p class="depth0">E. Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">1. The Heads of DoD Components shall:</p><p class="depth0">a. Establish a centralized organization (hereafter referred to as ``the centralized organization'') to monitor and ensure the coordination of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies for each significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities affecting the DoD Component.</p><p class="depth0">b. Establish procedures requiring the centralized organization to discuss regularly with the assigned DoD criminal investigative organization(s) such issues as the current status of significant investigations and their coordination with prosecutive authorities.</p><p class="depth0">c. Establish procedures requiring that all coordination involving the DoJ, during the pendency of a criminal investigation, is accomplished by or with the advance knowledge of the appropriate DoD criminal investigative organization(s).</p><p class="depth0">d. Establish procedures to ensure appropriate coordination of actions between the centralized organizations of any DoD Components affected by a significant investigation of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</p><p class="depth0">e. Establish procedures to ensure that all proper and effective civil, administrative, and contractual remedies available to the Department of Defense are, when found applicable and appropriate, considered and undertaken promptly by the necessary DoD officials (e.g., commanders, programs officials, and contracting officers).

Gather, at the earliest practical point in the investigation, without reliance on grand jury subpoenas whenever possible, relevant information concerning responsible individuals, the organizational structure, finances, and contract history of DoD contractors under investigation for fraud or corruption related to procurement activities, to facilitate the criminal investigation as well as any civil, administrative, or contractual actions or remedies that may be taken. Some available sources of such information are listed in enclosure 2.</p><p class="depth0">g.

Timely notification shall be made to the centralized organization of each DoD

Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.</p><p class="depth0">j. Obtain a DD 350 report in all significant fraud investigations, as defined in subsection C.2. above, whether or not the case involved defective products or product substitution. Timely notification shall be made to the centralized organization of each DoD Component that is identified as having contract actions with the subject of the investigation.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Inspector General, Department of Defense (IG, DoD), shall:</p><p class="depth0">a. Develop training materials relating to fraud and corruption in procurement related activities which shall be utilized in all procurement related training in conjunction with training materials developed by the DoD Components. (See paragraph E.1.h., above.)</p><p class="depth0">b. Establish procedures for providing to the DoD criminal investigative organizations, through the Office of the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing (OAIG-AUD), reports of data contained in the Individual Procurement Action Report (DD Form 350) System.</p><p class="depth0">F. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Transmissions of information by DoD criminal investigative organizations required by subsection E.2., above, shall be made as expeditiously as possible, consistent with efforts not to compromise any ongoing criminal investigation. The transmission of the information may be delayed when, in the judgment of the head of the DoD criminal investigative organization, failure to delay would compromise the success of any investigation or prosecution. The prosecutive authorities dealing with the investigation shall be consulted, when appropriate, in making such determinations.</p><p class="depth0">G. Effective Date and Implementation</p><p class="depth0">This Directive is effective immediately. Forward two copies of implementing documents to the Inspector General, Department of Defense, within 120 days.

Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith,</p><p class="depth0">North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993
Mr. T. Hudson Taylor,Attorney At Law, 105 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167</p><p class="depth0">Dear Mr. Taylor: We have learned that you subpoenaed Captain Roberta Selby to testify at a deposition in the case Kramer v. Kramer, currently filed in state court, and that you directed her to bring her legal assistance file concerning her client, SSG Kramer.</p><p class="depth0">Under 32 CFR Sec. Sec. 97.6(c), 516.35, and 516.40, the Army must authorize the appearance of its personnel or the production of official documents in private litigation. In this case, the Army cannot authorize Captain Selby to appear or produce the requested file absent the following:</p><p class="depth0">You must request in writing her appearance and the production of the file in accordance with Department of Defense directives, 32 CFR Sec. 97.6(c), and Army regulations, 32 CFR Sec. Sec. 516.34-516.40. The request must include the nature of the proceeding, 32 CFR Sec. 516.34(b), and the nature and relevance of the official information sought. Id. Sec. 516.35(d). We cannot act on your request until we receive the required information. See, for example, United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F.2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989); United States v. Bizzard, 674 F.2d 1382 (11th Cir. 1982); United States v. Marino, 658 F.2d 1120 (6th Cir. 1981); United States v. Allen, 554 F.2d 398 (10th Cir. 1977).</p><p class="depth0">To overcome Federal statutory restrictions on the disclosure of the requested file imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a, you must provide either a written release authorization signed by the individual to whom the file pertains (that is, SSG Kramer) or a court ordered release signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. A subpoena signed by a clerk of court, notary, or other official is insufficient. See, for example, Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (DC Cir. 1985).</p><p class="depth0">In this case, because of the attorney-client relationship between Captain Selby and SSG Kramer, you must produce a written waiver of the attorney-client privilege from SSG Kramer. Because the privilege may protect both documents and testimony, Captain Selby may not divulge such information without SSG Kramer's consent. See, for example, Rule of Professional Conduct for Army Lawyers 1.6(a).</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the above requirements, Captain Selby's supervisor must approve her absence from duty. See 32 CFR Sec. 516.43. In this regard, we suggest you take the deposition at Fort Smith. In any event, however, you or your client must pay all travel expenses, as this is purely private litigation and witness' appearance must be at no expense to the United States. See id. Sec. 516.48(c).</p><p class="depth0">Finally, if Captain Selby does appear as a witness, she may only give factual testimony. She may not testify as an opinion or expert witness. This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy that generally prohibits Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. See id. Sec. Sec. 97.6(e), 516.42.</p><p class="depth0">Our sole concern in this matter is to protect the interests of the United States Army; the Army will not block access to witnesses or documents to which you are lawfully entitled. So that the Army can adequately protect its interests in this matter, I request that you respond to this letter by 27 April 1993. If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.</p><p class="depth0">Sincerely,Robert V. Jackansi,Major, JA, Chief, Administrative Law.</p><p class="depth0">Figure G-2.

Mr. T. Hudson Taylor,Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167</p><p class="depth0">Dear Mr. Taylor: This letter responds to your request to interview and depose Captain Buzz Sawyer as a witness in Morgan v. Jones. Subject to the following conditions, your request is approved.</p><p class="depth0">This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness. This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation. See 32 CFR Sec. 516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States. See 32 CFR Sec. 516.48.</p><p class="depth0">If you have any questions, please call CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.</p><p class="depth0">Sincerely,Robert V.

Mr. T. Hudson Taylor,Attorney At Law, l05 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167</p><p class="depth0">Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation: Smithers v. ABC Video. For the following reasons, the request is denied.</p><p class="depth0">Army Regulation 27-40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR Sec. Sec. 97.6(e), 516.42. Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances.</p><p class="depth0">The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest, or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies, a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0">The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government.</p><p class="depth0">This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony. You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception to the Army's policy.</p><p class="depth0">If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919-882-4500.</p><p class="depth0">Sincerely,Robert V.

Sec. 516.33-516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted, or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties.</p><p class="depth0">He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries suffered, or contemplated future treatment.</p><p class="depth0">His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities in private litigation. See 32 CFR Sec. Sec. 97.6(e), 516.42.</p><p class="depth0">The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the depositions.</p><p class="depth0">To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge.

Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted.</p><p class="depth0">4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved. Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA.</p><p class="depth0">5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following:
a. the contract number(s) involvedb. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be testedc. the purpose of the testingd. the alleged defect or the contractual requirement violatede. the CID report of investigation (ROI) number or the DCIS case numberf. cost of the test (a cost proposal should be an attachment to the test</p><p class="depth0">plan)g. where the test will be conductedh. how the test will be conductedi. the name and telephone number of the test team leaderj. the names of all test team membersk. the approximate dates of the testingl. the date that completion of the test is requiredm. a clear statement of the desired product (that is test report, raw</p><p class="depth0">data, analysis of results, evaluation of test results)n. the PRON to fund the testingo. a retention plan.</p><p class="depth0">6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing has approved the test plan.</p><p class="depth0">7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to protect it from being released to the field. A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval of the AUSA.</p><p class="depth0">8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically created to support the test plan.</p><p class="depth0">9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative remedies.

Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing.</p><p class="depth0">10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes regarding funding or any time sensitive issues.</p><p class="depth0">11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the PFA with the investigator and AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve the test plan.</p><p class="depth0">Figure I-1. Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before</p><p class="depth0">Office of Special Counsel</p><p class="depth0">Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before Office of</p><p class="depth0">Special Counsel</p><p class="depth0">1. Overview</p><p class="depth0">a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless the employee or military member--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0">b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0">c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA.</p><p class="depth0">2. Requests for Representation</p><p class="depth0">a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obtain written certification from their supervisor that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> They were acting within the scope of official duties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the OSC.</p><p class="depth0">b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0">c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee.</p><p class="depth0">3. Limitations on Representation</p><p class="depth0">a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary action proposed by the OSC.</p><p class="depth0">b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements contained in this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Attorney-Client Relationship</p><p class="depth0">a. An attorney-client relationship will be established and continued between the suspected or accused individual and assigned DA counsel.</p><p class="depth0">b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time the attorney was assigned.</p><p class="depth0">c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of the DA General Counsel, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel.</p><p class="depth0">d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between the client and the attorney.</p><p class="depth0">5. Funding</p><p class="depth0">This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation by the designated counsel.</p><p class="depth0">6. Status</p><p class="depth0">A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar purposes.</p><p class="depth0">7. Advice to Witnesses</p><p class="depth0">The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries:</p><p class="depth0">a. A witness may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question.</p><p class="depth0">b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.</p><p class="depth0">c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The recorder is used in full view.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All attendees are informed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as a condition of signing.</p>
