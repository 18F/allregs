                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedies for noncompliance. If a Cooperator materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the REE Agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Sec. 550.10, take one or more of the following actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the Cooperator or more severe enforcement action by the REE Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withhold further awards for the project or program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Take other remedies that may be legally available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a Cooperator resulting from obligations incurred by the Cooperator during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the REE Agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or thereafter. Other Cooperator costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the Cooperator before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are non-cancellable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a Cooperator from being subject to debarment and suspension under Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 and USDA implementing regulations (7 CFR part 3017).</p>
