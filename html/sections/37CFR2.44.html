The requirements for an application under section 44(e) of the Act are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The requirements of Sec.  2.34(a)(3)(ii) and (iii); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A verified statement in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Claim of priority, based upon an earlier-filed foreign application, under section 44(d) of the Act.

(1) If the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii)(B), or (a)(4)(iv)(B) of this section is not filed within a reasonable time after it is signed, the Office may require the applicant to submit a substitute verified statement attesting that, as of the application filing date, the mark was in use in commerce and the applicant was exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or, as of the application filing date, the applicant had a bona fide intention, and was entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii)(B), (a)(4)(iv)(B), or (a)(4)(v) of this section is not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must also allege that, as of the application filing date, the mark was in use in commerce and the applicant was exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce; or, as of the application filing date, the applicant had a bona fide intention, and was entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> More than one basis. In an application under section 1 or 44 of the Act, an applicant may claim more than one basis, provided the applicant satisfies all requirements for the bases claimed. In such case, the applicant must specify each basis, followed by the goods, services, or collective membership organization to which that basis applies. An applicant must specify the goods, services, or collective membership organization covered by more than one basis. Section 1(a) and 1(b) of the Act may not both be claimed for identical goods, or services, or the same collective membership organization in one application. A basis under section 66(a) of the Act may not be combined with another basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In an application for concurrent use under Sec.  2.42, the verified statement in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(D) of this section must be modified to indicate that no other persons except members and the concurrent users as specified in the application have the right to use the mark in commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Multiple-class applications.
