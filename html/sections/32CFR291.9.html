                            <p class="depth0">Information that has not been given a security classification  pursuant to the criteria of an Executive Order, but which may be  withheld from the public for one or more of the reasons cited in FOIA  exemptions 2 through 9 shall be considered as being for official use  only. No other material shall be considered or marked ``For Official Use  Only'' (FOUO) and FOUO is not authorized as an anemic form of  classification to protect national security interests. See DNA  Instruction 5230.2A \5\ for additional information regarding FOUO  policy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ See footnote 2, to Sec. 291.6(a) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior FOUO application. The prior application of FOUO markings  is not a conclusive basis for withholding a record that is requested  under the FOIA. When such a record is requested, the information in it  shall be evaluated to determine whether, under current circumstances,  FOIA exemptions apply in withholding the record or portions of it. If  any exemption or exemptions apply or applies, it may nonetheless be  released when it is determined that no governmental interest will be  jeopardized by its release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Historical papers. Records, such as notes, working papers, and  drafts retained as historical evidence of DNA actions enjoy no special  status apart from the exemptions under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time to mark records. The marking of records at the time of  their creation provides notice of FOUO content and facilitates review  when a record is requested under the FOIA. Records requested under the  FOIA that do not bear such markings, shall not be assumed to be  releaseable without examination for the presence of information   that requires continued protection and qualifies as exempt from public  release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Distribution statement. Information in a technical document that  requires a distribution statement pursuant to DNA Instruction 5230.24A  shall bear that statement and may be marked FOUO, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Termination. The originator or other competent authority, e.g.,  initial denial and appellate authorities, shall terminate ``For Official  Use Only'' markings or status when circumstances indicate that the  information no longer requires protection from public disclosure. When  FOUO status is terminated, all known holders shall be notified, to the  extent practical. Upon notification, holders shall efface or remove the  ``For Official Use Only'' markings, but records in file or storage need  not be retrieved solely for that purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Disposal. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nonrecord copies of FOUO materials may be  destroyed by tearing each copy into pieces to preclude reconstructing,  and placing them in regular trash containers. When local circumstances  or experience indicates that this destruction method is not sufficiently  protective of FOUO information, local authorities may direct other  methods but must give due consideration to the additional expense  balanced against the degree of sensitivity of the type of FOUO  information contained in the records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in  accordance with the disposal standards established under 44 U.S.C.  chapter 33, as implemented by DNA instructions concerning records  disposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Unauthorized disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO  records does not constitute an unauthorized disclosure of DNA  information classified for security purposes. Appropriate administrative  action shall be taken, however, to fix responsibility for unauthorized  disclosure whenever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall  be taken against those responsible. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO  information that is protected by the Privacy Act, may also result in  civil and criminal sanctions against responsible persons. The DNA office  that originated the FOUO information shall be informed of its  unauthorized disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
