                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section describes the four steps that we follow to  calculate your program cohort default rate for a fiscal year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the  borrowers in your GE program's cohort for the fiscal year. If the total  number of borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 10, we also include the  borrowers in your cohorts for the two most recent prior fiscal years for  which we have data that identifies those borrowers who entered repayment  during those fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the  borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in default  by the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year those  borrowers entered repayment. If more than one cohort will be used to  calculate your program cohort default rate, we identify defaulted  borrowers separately for each cohort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your  program cohort default rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fourth, we apply your program cohort default rate to your  program at all of your locations--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official  program cohort default rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From the date on which you receive the notice of your official  program cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the  program cohort default rate no longer applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identify the borrowers in a cohort. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, your cohort for a fiscal year consists  of all of your current and former students who, during that fiscal year,  entered repayment on any Federal Stafford Loan, Federal SLS Loan, Direct  Subsidized Loan, or Direct Unsubsidized Loan that they received to  attend the GE program, or on the portion of a loan made under the  Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal Direct Consolidation  Loan Program that is used to repay those loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and  may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Federal Direct  Unsubsidized Loan is not considered for the purpose of calculating and  applying program cohort default rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a borrower in a  cohort for a fiscal year is considered to be in default if, before the  end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year the borrower  entered repayment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The borrower defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include  the borrower in the cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program  loan that repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the  cohort (however, a borrower is not considered to be in default on a  FFELP loan unless a claim for insurance has been paid on the loan by a  guaranty agency or by us);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on  any Direct Loan Program loan that was used to include the borrower in  the cohort or on any Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that  repaid a loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and  the borrower's failure persists for 360 days;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You or your owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other  affiliated entity or individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's  default on a loan that is used to include the borrower in that cohort;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The borrower fails to make an installment payment, when due, on  a Federal Stafford Loan that is held by the Secretary or a Federal  Consolidation Loan that is held by the Secretary and that was used to  repay a Federal Stafford Loan, if such Federal Stafford Loan or Federal  Consolidation Loan was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and  the borrower's failure persists for 360 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan  that is, before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal  year in which it entered repayment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was  submitted or paid in error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Calculate the program cohort default rate. Except as provided in  Sec.  668.503, if there are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ten or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your  program cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dividing the number of borrowers in the cohort who are in  default, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, by the  number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fewer than 10 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your  program cohort default rate is the percentage that is calculated by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the first two years we attempt to calculate program cohort  default rates under this part for a program, dividing the total number  of borrowers in that program's cohort and in the two most recent prior  cohorts for which we have data to identify the individuals comprising  the cohort who are in default, as determined for each program's cohort  under paragraph (c) of this section, by the total number of borrowers in  that program cohort and the two most recent prior cohorts for which we  have data to identify the individuals comprising the cohort, as  determined for each program cohort under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For other fiscal years, by dividing the total number of  borrowers in that program cohort and in the two most recent prior  program cohorts who are in default, as determined for each program  cohort under paragraph (c) of this section, by the total number of  borrowers in that program cohort and the two most recent prior program  cohorts as determined for each program cohort under paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If we identify a total of fewer than ten borrowers under  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we do not calculate a draft program  cohort default rate for that fiscal year.
