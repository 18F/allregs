Every such  motion must state specifically the grounds relied upon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion to reopen hearings. A motion to reopen a hearing to take  further evidence may be filed at any time prior to the issuance of the  Administrator's final order. Every such motion shall state briefly the  nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show that such  evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth good reason why  such evidence was not adduced at a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings, or to reconsider final  orders. A motion to rehear or reargue the proceeding or to reconsider  the final order shall be filed within 10 days after the date of service  of the final order. Every such motion must state specifically the  matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and alleged errors  must be briefly stated. Motions to rehear or reargue proceedings or to  reconsider final orders shall be directed to, and heard by, the  Environmental Appeals Board. Motions under this section directed to the  Administrator will not be considered, except in cases that the  Environmental Appeals Board has referred to the Administrator pursuant  to Sec. 164.2(g) and in which the Administrator has issued the final  order. A motion for reconsideration shall not stay the effective date of  the final order unless specifically so ordered by the Environmental  Appeals Board.
