                            <p class="depth0">A complex credit union must calculate its risk-based capital ratio in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of the risk-based capital ratio. To determine its risk-based capital ratio, a complex credit union must calculate the percentage, rounded to two decimal places, of its risk-based capital ratio numerator as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to its

total risk-weighted assets as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Risk-based capital ratio numerator. The risk-based capital ratio numerator is the sum of the specific capital elements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, minus the regulatory adjustments in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Capital elements of the risk-based capital ratio numerator. The capital elements of the risk-based capital numerator are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Undivided earnings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Appropriation for non-conforming investments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other reserves;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Equity acquired in merger;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Net income</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> ALLL, maintained in accordance with GAAP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Secondary capital accounts included in net worth (as defined in Sec. 702.2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Section 208 assistance included in net worth (as defined in Sec. 702.2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk-based capital ratio numerator deductions. The elements deducted from the sum of the capital elements of the risk-based capital ratio numerator are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> NCUSIF Capitalization Deposit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Goodwill;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other intangible assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Identified losses not reflected in the risk-based capital ratio numerator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Risk-weighted assets--(1) General. Risk-weighted assets includes risk- weighted on-balance sheet assets as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, plus the risk-weighted off-balance sheet assets in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, plus the risk-weighted derivatives in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, less the risk-based capital ratio numerator deductions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If a particular asset, derivative contract, or off balance sheet item has features or characteristics that suggest it could potentially fit into more than one risk weight category, then a credit union shall assign the asset, derivative contract, or off balance sheet item to the risk weight category that most accurately and appropriately reflects its associated credit risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk weights for on-balance sheet assets. The risk categories and weights for assets of a complex credit union are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Category 1--zero percent risk weight. A credit union must assign a zero percent risk weight to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The balance of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash, currency and coin, including vault, automatic teller machine, and teller cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> share-secured loans, where the shares securing the loan are on deposit with the credit union.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The exposure amount of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An obligation of the U.S. Government, its central bank, or a U.S. Government agency that is directly and unconditionally guaranteed, excluding detached security coupons, ex-coupon securities, and interest-only mortgage-backed-security STRIPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal Reserve Bank stock and Central Liquidity Facility stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Insured balances due from FDIC-insured depositories or federally insured credit unions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Category 2--20 percent risk weight.

A credit union must assign a 150 percent risk weight to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The outstanding balance, net of government guarantees and including loans held for sale, of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current junior-lien residential real estate loans that comprise more than 20 percent of assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Junior-lien residential real estate loans that are not current.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consumer loans that are not current.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Current commercial loans (net of contractual compensating balances), which comprise more than 50 percent of assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercial loans (net of contractual compensating balances), which are not current.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The exposure amount of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Perpetual contributed capital at corporate credit unions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Equity investments in CUSOs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Category 7--250 percent risk weight.
