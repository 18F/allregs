                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the suspension  or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on  debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney  General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative  costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if  any. Prior to referring a debt to the DOJ for litigation, DOE may  suspend or terminate collection under this part with respect to debts  arising out of activities of, or referred to, DOE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or  collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such  other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest,  penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or  terminate rests solely with the DOJ. If DOE believes that suspension or  termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, DOE  shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate  litigating division in the DOJ, using the CCLR. The referral should  specify the reasons for DOE's recommendation. If, prior to referral to  the DOJ, DOE determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly  without legal merit, DOE may terminate collection activity regardless of  the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.</p>
