                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policies.

A corporate credit union may enter into a  repurchase agreement provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The corporate credit union, directly or through its agent,  receives written confirmation of the transaction, and either takes  physical possession or control of the repurchase securities or is  recorded as owner of the repurchase securities through the Federal  Reserve Book-Entry Securities Transfer System;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The repurchase securities are legal investments for that  corporate credit union;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The corporate credit union, directly or through its agent,  receives daily assessment of the market value of the repurchase  securities and maintains adequate margin that reflects a risk assessment  of the repurchase securities and the term of the transaction; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The corporate credit union has entered into signed contracts  with all approved counterparties and agents, and ensures compliance with  the contracts. Such contracts must address any supplemental terms and  conditions necessary to meet the specific requirements of this part.

The corporate or  its agent ensures compliance with the agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Investment companies. A corporate credit union may invest in an  investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a), or  a collective investment fund maintained by a national bank under 12 CFR  9.18 or a mutual savings bank under 12 CFR 550.260, provided that the  company or fund prospectus restricts the investment portfolio to  investments and investment transactions that are permissible for that  corporate credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Investment settlement. A corporate credit union may only  contract for the purchase or sale of an investment if the transaction is  settled on a delivery versus payment basis within 60 days for mortgage- backed securities, within 30 days for new issues (other than mortgage- backed securities), and within three days for all other securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prohibitions. A corporate credit union is prohibited from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchasing or selling derivatives, except for embedded options  not required under GAAP to be accounted for separately from the host  contract or forward sales commitments on loans to be purchased by the  corporate credit union;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engaging in trading securities unless accounted for on a trade  date basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engaging in adjusted trading or short sales;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Purchasing mortgage servicing rights, small business related  securities, residual interests in collateralized mortgage obligations,  residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits, or  residual interests in asset-backed securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Purchasing net interest margin securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Purchasing collateralized debt obligations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Purchasing private label residential mortgage-backed securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Purchasing subordinated securities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Purchasing stripped mortgage-backed securities (SMBS), or  securities that represent interests in SMBS, except as described in  subparagraphs (i) and (iii) below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A corporate credit union may invest in exchangeable  collateralized mortgage obligations (exchangeable CMOs) representing  beneficial ownership interests in one or more interest-only classes of a  CMO (IO CMOs) or principal-only classes of a CMO (PO CMOs), but only if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At the time of purchase, the ratio of the market price to the  remaining principal balance is between .8 and 1.2, meaning that the  discount or premium of the market price to par must be less than 20  points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The offering circular or other official information available at  the time of purchase indicates that the notional principal on each  underlying IO CMO should decline at the same rate as the principal on  one or more of the underlying non-IO CMOs, and that the principal on  each underlying PO CMO should decline at the same rate as the principal,  or notional principal, on one or more of the underlying non-PO CMOs; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The credit union investment staff has the expertise dealing with  exchangeable CMOs to apply the conditions in paragraphs (h)(5)(i)(A) and  (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A corporate credit union that invests in an exchangeable CMO  may exercise the exchange option only if all of   the underlying CMOs are permissible investments for that credit union.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A corporate credit union may accept an exchangeable CMO  representing beneficial ownership interests in one or more IO CMOs or PO  CMOs as an asset associated with an investment repurchase transaction or  as collateral in a securities lending transaction. When the exchangeable  CMO is associated with one of these two transactions, it need not  conform to the conditions in paragraphs (h)(5)(i)(A) or (B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Conflicts of interest. A corporate credit union's officials,  employees, and immediate family members of such individuals, may not  receive pecuniary consideration in connection with the making of an  investment or deposit by the corporate credit union. Employee  compensation is exempt from this prohibition. All transactions not  specifically prohibited by this paragraph must be conducted at arm's  length and in the interest of the corporate credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Grandfathering. A corporate credit union's authority to hold an  investment is governed by the regulation in effect at the time of  purchase. However, all grandfathered investments are subject to the  requirements of Secs. 704.8 and 704.9.  [75 FR 64839, Oct. 20, 2010]</p>
