                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each cargo tank must be pressure and leakage tested in  accordance with this section and Secs. 178.346-5, 178.347-5, or 178.348- 5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure test. Each cargo tank or cargo tank compartment must be  tested hydrostatically or pneumatically. Each cargo tank of a multi- cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with the adjacent cargo tanks  empty and at atmospheric pressure. Each closure, except pressure relief  devices and loading/unloading venting devices rated at less than the  prescribed test pressure, must be in place during the test. If the  venting device is not removed during the test, such device must be  rendered inoperative by a clamp, plug or other equally effective  restraining device, which may not prevent the detection of leaks, or  damage the device. Restraining devices must be removed immediately after  the test is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hydrostatic method. Each cargo tank, including its domes, must  be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, the  temperature of which may not exceed 100 F. The cargo tank must then be  pressurized as prescribed in the applicable specification. The pressure  must be gauged at the top of the cargo tank. The prescribed test  pressure must be maintained for at least 10 minutes during which time  the cargo tank must be inspected for leakage, bulging, or other defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pneumatic method. A pneumatic test may be used in place of the  hydrostatic test. However, pneumatic pressure testing may involve higher  risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be  provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during  the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas.  Test pressure must be reached gradually by increasing the pressure to  one half of test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in  steps of approximately one tenth of the test pressure until test   pressure is reached. Test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes.  The pressure must then be reduced to the inspection pressure which must  be maintained while the entire cargo tank surface is inspected for  leakage and other sign of defects. The inspection method must consist of  coating all joints and fittings with a solution of soap and water or  other equally sensitive method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Leakage test. The cargo tank with all its accessories in place  and operable must be leak tested at not less than 80 percent of tank's  MAWP with the pressure maintained for at least 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any cargo tank that leaks, bulges or shows any other sign of  defect must be rejected. Rejected cargo tanks must be suitably repaired  and retested successfully prior to being returned to service. The retest  after any repair must use the same method of test under which the cargo  tank was originally rejected.
