Any employee who believes that he has been discriminated against in  violation of section 11(c) of the Act may, within 30 days after such  violation occurs, lodge a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging  such violation. The Secretary shall then cause appropriate investigation  to be made. If, as a result of such investigation, the Secretary  determines that the provisions of section 11(c) have been violated civil  action may be instituted in any appropriate United States district  court, to restrain violations of section 11(c)(1) and to obtain other  appropriate relief, including rehiring or reinstatement of the employee  to his former position with back pay. Section 11(c) further provides for  notification of complainants by the Secretary of determinations made  pursuant to their complaints.</p>
