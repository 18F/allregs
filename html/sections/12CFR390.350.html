                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Examinations and audits. Each State savings association and  affiliate thereof shall be examined periodically, and may be examined at  any time, by the FDIC, with appraisals when deemed advisable, in  accordance with general policies from time to time established by the  FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appraisals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise ordered by the FDIC, appraisal  of real estate by the FDIC in connection with any examination or audit  of a State savings association or its affiliate shall be made by an  appraiser, or by appraisers, selected by the appropriate FDIC region, as  that term is defined in Sec. 303.2 of this chapter, in which such State  savings association is located. The cost of such appraisal shall  promptly be paid by such State savings association or its affiliate  direct to such appraiser or appraisers upon receipt by the State savings  association or its affiliate of a statement of such cost as approved by  the appropriate regional director. A copy of the report of each  appraisal made by the FDIC pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions  of this section shall be furnished to the State savings association or  its affiliate, as appropriate within a reasonable time, not to exceed 90  days, following the completion of such appraisals and the filing of a  report thereof by the appraiser, or appraisers, with the appropriate  FDIC office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC may obtain at any time, at its expense, such appraisals  of any of the assets, including the security therefor, of a State  savings association or its affiliate as the FDIC deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establishment and maintenance of records. To enable the FDIC to  examine State savings associations and affiliates and audit State  savings associations and its affiliates, pursuant to the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section, each State savings association, and its  affiliate shall establish and maintain such accounting and other records  as will provide an accurate and complete record of all business it  transacts. This includes, without limitation, establishing and  maintaining such other records as are required by statute or any other  regulation to which the State savings association and its affiliate is  subject. The documents, files, and other material or property comprising  said records shall at all times be available for such examination and  audit wherever any of said records, documents, files, material, or  property may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change in location of records. A State savings association shall  not transfer the location of any of its general accounting or control  records, or the maintenance thereof, from its home office to a branch or  service office, or from a branch or service office to its home office or  to another branch or service office unless prior to the date of transfer  its board of directors has:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By resolution authorized the transfer or maintenance and;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sent a certified copy of the resolution to the appropriate  regional director for the region in which the principal office of the  State savings association is located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of data processing services for maintenance of records. A  State savings association which determines to maintain any of its  records by means of data processing services shall so notify the  appropriate regional director for the region in which the principal  office of such State savings association is located, in writing, at  least 90 days prior to the date on which such maintenance of records  will begin. Such notification shall include identification of the  records to be maintained by data processing services and a statement as  to the location at which such records will be maintained. Any contract,  agreement, or arrangement made by a State savings association pursuant  to which data processing services are to be performed for such State  savings association shall be in writing and shall expressly provide that  the records to be maintained by such services shall at all times be  available for examination and audit.</p>
