The Commission will review information to  determine whether disclosure would be reasonably related to effectuating  one or more of the specific purposes of the CPSA, as set forth in  sections 2(b) and 5, 15 U.S.C. 2051(b) and 2054.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purposes of the FHSA, FFA, PPPA and RSA. The Commission will  also review information concerning products subject to the transferred  acts it administers and to the Commission's specific functions under  those acts to determine whether disclosure of information would be  reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of those acts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purposes of the FOIA. FOIA requests will be reviewed to  determine whether disclosure of the information is reasonably related to  effectuating one or more of the purposes of the acts administered by the  Commission. In the event of a close question on this issue, the  Commission will defer to the purposes of the FOIA. The FOIA establishes  a general right of the public to have access to information in the  Commission's possession, particularly information that reveals whether  the Commission is meeting its statutory responsibilities or information  upon which the Commission bases a decision that affects the public  health and safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In reviewing proposed information disclosures, the Commission  will consider disclosing the material on the basis of whether release of  the information, when taken as a whole, was prepared or is maintained in  the course of or to support an activity of the Commission designed to  accomplish one or more of the statutory purposes.</p>
