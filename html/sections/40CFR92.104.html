Unless specified otherwise in this subpart, all provisions apply to both locomotive and engine testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The test procedures for engine testing are intended to produce emission measurements that are essentially identical to emission measurements produced during locomotive testing using the same engine configuration.

The following requirements apply for all engine tests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engine speed setpoints for each mode shall be within 2 percent of the speed of the engine when it is operated in the locomotive. Engine load setpoints for each mode shall be within 2 percent (or 3.0 horsepower, whichever is greater) of the load of the engine when it is operated in the locomotive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The temperature of the air entering the engine after any charge air cooling shall be within 5 F of the typical intake air temperature when the engine is operated in the locomotive under similar ambient conditions. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain engine cooling during operation on the dynamometer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The engine air inlet system used during testing shall have an air inlet restriction within 1 inch of water of the upper limit of a typical engine as installed with clean air filters, as established by the manufacturer or remanufacturer for the engine being tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testers performing engine testing under this subpart shall not use test procedures otherwise allowed by the provisions of this subpart where such procedures are not consistent with good engineering practice and the regulatory goal specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provisions that specify different requirements for locomotive and/or engine testing are described in Secs. 92.106, 92.108(a) and (b)(1), 92.111(b)(2) and (c), 92.114(a)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(ii), (c)(2)(iii)(A) and (d), 92.115(c), 92.116, 92.123(a)(2) and (b), 92.124(d), 92.125(a) and (b), 92.126(a)(7)(iii)(A).
