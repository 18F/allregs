The Court may direct that books, papers, documents, or other objects designated in the subpoena be produced before the Court at a time before the trial or before the time when they are to be offered into evidence. It may, upon their production, allow the books, papers, documents, or objects or portions thereof to be inspected by the parties and their representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any peace officer or any other person who is not a party and who is at least 18 years of age may serve a subpoena.
