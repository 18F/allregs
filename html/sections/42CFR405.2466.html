                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Payments made to RHCs or FQHCs that are authorized to  bill under the reasonable cost system during a reporting period are  subject to annual reconciliation to assure that those payments do not  exceed or fall short of the allowable costs attributable to covered  services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during that period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of reconciliation for RHCs or FQHCs that are  authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total  reimbursement amount due the RHC or FQHC for covered services furnished  to Medicare beneficiaries is based on the report specified in Sec.  405.2470(c)(2) and is calculated by the MAC as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average cost per visit is calculated by dividing the total  allowable cost incurred for the reporting period by total visits for RHC  or FQHC services furnished during the period. The average cost per visit  is subject to tests of reasonableness which may be established in  accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total cost of RHC or FQHC services furnished to Medicare  beneficiaries is calculated by multiplying the average cost per visit by  the number of visits for covered RHC or FQHC services by beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total payment due the RHC is 80 percent of the amount  calculated by subtracting the amount of deductible incurred by  beneficiaries that is attributable to RHC services from the cost of  these services. FQHC services are not subject to a deductible and the  payment computation for FQHCs does not include a reduction related to  the deductible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For RHCs and FQHCs, payment for pneumococcal and influenza  vaccine and their administration is 100 percent of Medicare reasonable  cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total reimbursement amount due is compared with total  payments made to the RHC or FQHC for the reporting period, and the  difference constitutes the amount of the reconciliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of program reimbursement. The MAC notifies the RHC or  FQHC that is authorized to bill under the reasonable-cost system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Setting forth its determination of the total reimbursement  amount due the RHC or FQHC for the reporting period and the amount, if  any, of the reconciliation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Informing the RHC or FQHC of its right to have the determination  reviewed at a hearing under the procedures set forth in subpart R of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of reconciliation amount--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Underpayments. If the  total reimbursement due the RHC or FQHC that is authorized to bill under  the reasonable cost system exceeds the payments made for the reporting  period, the MAC makes a lump-sum payment to the RHC or FQHC to bring  total payments into agreement with total reimbursement due the RHC or  FQHC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overpayments. If the total payments made to a RHC or FQHC for  the reporting period exceed the total reimbursement due the RHC or FQHC  for the period, the MAC arranges with the RHC or FQHC for repayment  through a lump-sum refund, or, if that poses a hardship for the RHC or  FQHC, through offset against subsequent payments or a combination of  offset and refund. The repayment must be completed as quickly as  possible, generally within 12 months from the date of the notice of  program reimbursement. A longer repayment period may be agreed to by the  MAC if the MAC is satisfied that unusual circumstances exist which  warrant a longer period.
