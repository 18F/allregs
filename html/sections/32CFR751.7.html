                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Losses in unassigned quarters in the United States. Claims for property damaged or lost at quarters occupied by the claimant within the United States that are not assigned or otherwise provided by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Currency or jewelry shipped or stored in baggage. Claims for lost currency, shipped or stored in baggage are not payable. Small, valuable, highly pilferable items should normally be hand-carried rather than shipped, however, if expensive or valuable jewelry or coin collections are shipped, a full description of each item of expensive jewelry and of any coin or money collection must be listed and described on the inventory for its loss to be payable. Each item must also be listed as missing at the time of delivery. If not noted at the time of delivery, the claimant must satisfactorily explain why.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enemy property or war trophies. This includes only property that was originally enemy property or a war trophy that passed into the hands of a collector and was then purchased by a claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unserviceable or Worn-Out Property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loss or damage to property to the extent of any available insurance coverage. Except for claims for loss or damage to household goods or privately-owned vehicles (POVS) while shipped or stored at Government expense, when the property lost, damaged, or destroyed is insured, the claimant must make a demand for payment against the insurance company under the terms of the policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Inconvenience or loss of use. Expenses arising from late delivery of personal property, including but not limited to the expenses for food, lodging, and furniture rental, loss of use, interest, carrying charges, attorney's

fees, telephone calls, additional costs of transporting claimant or family members, time spent in preparation of claim, or cost of insurance are not compensable. While such claims do not lie against the Government, members should be referred to the Personal Property Office for assistance in filing their inconvenience claims against the commercial carriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Items of speculative value. Theses, manuscripts, unsold paintings, or a similar creative or artistic work done by the claimant, friend, or a relative is limited to the cost of materials only. The value of such items is speculative. Compensation for a utilitarian object made by the claimant, such as a quilt or bookcase, is limited to the value of an item of similar quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Loss or damage to property due to negligence of the claimant. Negligence is a failure to exercise the degree of care expected under the circumstances that is the proximate cause of the loss. Losses due, in whole or in part, to the negligence of the claimant, the claimant's spouse, child, houseguest, employee, or agent are not compensable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Business property. Losses of items acquired for resale or use in a private business are not compensable. If property is acquired for both business and personal use, compensation will not be allowed if business use is substantial, or is the primary purpose for which the item was purchased, or if the item is designed for professional use and is not normally intended for personal use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Motor vehicles. Collision damage is not payable unless it meets the criteria for payment as property used for the benefit of the Government as established in Sec. 751.6(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Violation of law or directives. Property acquired, possessed, or transported unlawfully or in violation of competent regulations or directives. This includes vehicles, weapons, or property shipped to accommodate another person, as well as property used to transport contraband.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Sales tax. Sales taxes associated with repair or replacement costs will not be considered unless the claimant provides proof that the sales tax was actually paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Appraisal fees. An appraisal, as distinguished from an estimate of replacement or repair, is defined as a valuation of an item provided by a person who is not in the business of selling or repairing that type of property. Normally, claimants are expected to obtain appraisals on expensive items at their own expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Quantities of property not reasonable or useful under the circumstances are not compensable. Factors to be considered are claimant's living conditions, family size, social obligations, and any particular need to have more than average quantities, as well as the actual circumstances surrounding the acquisition and loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Intangible Property, such as Bankbooks, Checks, Promissory Notes, Stock Certificates, Bonds, Bills of Lading, Warehouse Receipts, Baggage Checks, Insurance Policies, Money Orders, and Traveler's Checks are not Compensable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Property Owned by the United States, Except where the Claimant is Responsible to an Agency of the Government other than the DON.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Contractual coverage. Losses, or any portion thereof, that have been recovered or are recoverable pursuant to contract are not compensable.
