                                Sec. 1.911-2  Qualified individuals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An individual is a qualified individual if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual's tax home is in a foreign country or countries  throughout--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individual is either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A citizen of the United States who establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate that the individual has  been a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an  uninterrupted period which includes an entire taxable year, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A citizen or resident of the United States who has been  physically present in a foreign country or countries for at least 330  full days during any period of twelve consecutive months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tax home. For purposes of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the  term ``tax home'' has the same meaning which it has for purposes of  section 162(a)(2) (relating to travel expenses away from home). Thus,  under section 911, an individual's tax home is considered to be located  at his regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business  or, if the individual has no regular or principal place of business  because of the nature of the business, then at his regular place of  abode in a real and substantial sense. An individual shall not, however,  be considered to have a tax home in a foreign country for any period for  which the individual's abode is in the United States. Temporary presence  of the individual in the United States does not necessarily mean that  the individual's abode is in the United States during that time.  Maintenance of a dwelling in the United States by an individual, whether  or not that dwelling is used by the individual's spouse and dependents,  does not necessarily mean that the individual's abode is in the United  States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of bona fide residence. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section, whether an individual is a bona fide resident  of a foreign country shall be determined by applying, to the extent  practical, the principles of section 871 and the regulations thereunder,  relating to the determination of the residence of aliens. Bona fide  residence in a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period  may be established, even if temporary visits are made during the period  to the United States or elsewhere on vacation or business. An individual  with earned income from sources within a foreign country is not a bona  fide resident of that country if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual claims to be a nonresident of that foreign  country in a statement submitted to the authorities of that country, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The earned income of the individual is not subject, by reason of  nonresidency in the foreign country, to the income tax of that country.  If an individual has submitted a statement of nonresidence to the  authorities of a foreign country the accuracy of which has not been  resolved as of any date when a determination of the individual's bona  fide residence is being made, then the individual will not be considered  a bona fide resident of the foreign country as of that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of physical presence. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the following rules apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Twelve-month test. A period of twelve consecutive months may  begin with any day but must end on the day before the corresponding day  in the twelfth succeeding month. The twelve-month period may begin  before or after arrival in a foreign country and may end before or after  departure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the  term ``transit between two points outside the United States'' has the  same meaning that it has when used in section 7701(b)(6)(C).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Illustrations of the physical presence requirement. The physical  presence requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. B, a U.S. citizen, arrives in Venezuela from New York at  12 noon on April 24, 1982. B remains in Venezuela until 2 p.m. on March  21, 1983, at which time B departs for the United States. Among other  possible twelve month periods, B is present in a foreign country an  aggregate of 330 full days during each of the following twelve month  periods: March 21, 1982 through March 20, 1983; and April 25, 1982  through April 24, 1983.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. C, a U.S. citizen, travels extensively from the time C  leaves the United States on March 5, 1982, until the time C departs the  United Kingdom on January 1, 1984, to return to the United States  permanently. The schedule of C's travel and the number of full days at  each location are listed below:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Full days</p><p class="depth3">in</p><p class="depth3">Country                      Time and date of arrival   Time and date of departure   foreign</p><p class="depth3">country ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- United States................................  ..........................  10 p.m. (by air) Mar. 5,</p><p class="depth3">1982.

For purposes only of establishing that an  individual is a qualified individual under paragraph (a) of this  section, residence or presence in a foreign country while there employed  by the U.S. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.  government counts towards satisfaction of the requirements of  Sec. 1.911-2(a). (But see section 911(b)(1)(B)(ii) and Sec. 1.911- 3(c)(3) for the rule excluding amounts paid by the U.S. government to an  employee from the definition of foreign earned income.) Time spent in a  foreign country prior to January 1, 1982, counts toward satisfaction of  the bona fide residence and physical presence requirements, even though  no exclusion or deduction may be allowed under section 911 for income  attributable to services performed during that time. For purposes or  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the term ``resident of the United  States'' includes an individual for whom a valid election is in effect  under section 6013 (g) or (h) for the taxable year or years during which  the physical presence requirement is satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver of period of stay in foreign country due to war or civil  unrest. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section, an individual whose tax home is in, a foreign country, and who  is a bona fide resident of, or present in a foreign country for any  period, who leaves the foreign country after August 31, 1978, before  meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, may as  provided in this paragraph, qualify to make an election under section  911(a) and Sec. 1.911-7(a). If the Secretary determines, after  consultation with the Secretary of State or his delegate, that war,  civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions existed in a foreign  country, then the Secretary shall publish the name of the foreign  country and the dates between which such conditions were deemed to  exist. In order to qualify to make an election under this paragraph, the  individual must establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the  individual left a foreign country, the name of which has been published  by the Secretary, during the period when adverse conditions existed and  that the individual could reasonably have expected to meet the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section but for the adverse  conditions. The individual shall attach to his return for the taxable  year a statement that the individual expected to meet the requirements  of paragraph (a) of this section but for the conditions in the foreign  country which precluded the normal conduct of business by the  individual. Such individual shall be treated as a qualified individual,  but only for the actual period of residence or presence. Thus, in  determining the number of the individual's qualifying days, only days  within the period of actual residence or presence shall be counted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> United States. The term ``United States'' when used in a  geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of the  United States. It includes the states, the District of Columbia, the  possessions and territories of the United States, the territorial waters  of the United States, the air space over the United States, and the  seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the  territorial waters of the United States and over which the United States  has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect  to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Foreign country. The term ``foreign country'' when used in a  geographical sense includes any territory under the sovereignty of a  government other than that of the United States. It includes the  territorial waters of the foreign country (determined in accordance with  the laws of the United States), the air space over the foreign country,  and the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent  to the territorial waters of the foreign country and over which the  foreign country has exclusive rights, in accordance with international  law, with respect to the exploration and exploitation of natural  resources.  (Sec. 911 (95 Stat. 194; 26 U.S.C. 911) and sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26  U.S.C. 7805) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)  [T.D. 8006, 50 FR 2965, Jan. 23, 1985]</p>
