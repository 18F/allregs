Strengthening bonds, filed to increase the bond liability of the surety, shall not be construed in any sense to be substitute bonds, and the appropriate TTB officer shall not approve a strengthening bond

containing any notation which may be interpreted as a release of any former bond or as limiting the amount of either bond to less than its full amount.</p>
