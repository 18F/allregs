In addition the terms of payment of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall provide for discharge of the obligation at a definite date or dates or intervals, in amount specified on or computable from the face of the instrument. A loan which is payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation, or at a time not specified or computable from the language in the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or which contemplates periodic renewals at the option of the holder to satisfy the repayment requirements of this section, is not eligible for guaranty or insurance, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No guaranteed or insured obligation shall contain a provision to the effect that the holder shall have the right to declare the indebtedness due, or to pursue one or more legal or equitable remedies, if holder ``shall feel insecure,'' or upon the occurrence of one or more such conditions optional to the holder, without regard to an act or omission by the debtor, which condition by the terms of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument would at the option of the holder afford a basis for declaring a default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding the inclusion in the guaranteed or insured obligation of a provision contrary to the provisions of this section, the right of the holder to payment of the guaranty or insurance shall not be thereby impaired: Provided,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Default was declared or maturity was accelerated under some other provision of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activation or enforcement of such provision is warranted under Sec. 36.4350(i)(2), or if there exist conditions justifying the appointment of a receiver for the property (without reference to any contractual provisions for such appointment), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prior approval of the Secretary was obtained.

A delinquency will include all installment payments (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, advances, etc.) due and unpaid and any accumulated late charges plus any reasonable expenses incurred and paid by the holder if termination proceedings have begun (e.g., advertising costs, foreclosure costs, attorney or trustee fees, recording fees, etc.).
