The assurance shall be in effect for  the period during which funds made available through the Department are  extended. The Department specifies the form of the assurance, including  the extent to which assurances will be required concerning the  compliance obligations of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors,  and other participants, and provisions that give the United States a  right to seek its judicial enforcement. An applicant may incorporate  this assurance by reference in subsequent applications to the  Department.
