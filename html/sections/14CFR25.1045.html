The cooling tests must be conducted with the airplane in the configuration, and operating under the conditions, that are critical relative to cooling during each stage of flight. For the cooling tests, a temperature is ``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than two degrees F. per minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated, unless the entry condition normally is not one during which component and the engine fluid temperatures would stabilize (in which case, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated in order to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at the time of entry). The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The stage of flight is completed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An operating limitation is reached.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it may be assumed, for cooling test purposes, that the takeoff stage of flight is complete when the airplane reaches an altitude of 1,500 feet above the takeoff surface or reaches a point in the takeoff where the transition from the takeoff to the en route configuration is completed and a speed is reached at which compliance with Sec. 25.121(c) is shown, whichever point is at a higher altitude. The airplane must be in the following configuration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Landing gear retracted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wing flaps in the most favorable position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cowl flaps (or other means of controlling the engine cooling supply) in the position that provides adequate cooling in the hot-day condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Critical engine inoperative and its propeller stopped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Remaining engines at the maximum continuous power available for the altitude.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For hull seaplanes and amphibians, cooling must be shown during taxiing downwind for 10 minutes, at five knots above step speed.
