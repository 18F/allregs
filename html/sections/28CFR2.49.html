                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the parolee requests a local revocation hearing, he shall be given a revocation hearing reasonably near the place of the alleged violation(s) or arrest, if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parolee has not been convicted of a crime committed while under supervision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parolee denies that he has violated any condition of his release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The parolee shall also be given a local revocation hearing if he admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged violations, but denies at least one unadjudicated charge that may be determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or reparole, and requests the presence of one or more adverse witnesses regarding that contested charge. If the appearance of such witness at the hearing is precluded by the Commission for good cause, a local revocation hearing shall not be ordered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there are two or more alleged violations, the hearing may be conducted near the place of the violation chiefly relied upon as a basis for the issuance of the warrant or summons as determined by the Regional Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> A parolee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing upon the parolee's return or recommitment to an institution if the parolee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A parolee shall be given an institutional revocation hearing upon the parolee's return or recommitment to an institution if the parolee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Voluntarily waives the right to a local revocation hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Admits (or has been convicted of) one or more charged violations without contesting any unadjudicated charge that may be determinative of the Commission's decision regarding revocation and/or reparole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On his own motion, the Regional Commissioner may designate any case described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a local revocation hearing. The difference in procedures between a ``local revocation hearing'' and an ``institutional revocation hearing'' is set forth in Sec.  2.50(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A parolee retaken on a warrant issued by the Commission shall be retained in custody until final action relative to revocation of his release, unless otherwise ordered by the Regional Commissioner under Sec.  2.48(e)(2). A parolee who has been given a revocation hearing pursuant to the issuance of a summons under Sec.  2.44 shall remain on supervision pending the decision of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A local revocation hearing shall be scheduled to be held within sixty days of the probable cause determination. Institutional revocation hearings shall be scheduled to be held within ninety days of the date of the execution of the violator warrant upon which the parolee was retaken. However, if a parolee requests and receives any postponement or consents to a postponed revocation proceeding, or if a parolee by his actions otherwise precludes the prompt conduct of such proceedings, the above-stated time limits may be extended. A local revocation hearing may be conducted by a hearing examiner, hearing examiner panel, or other official designated by the Regional Commissioner.
