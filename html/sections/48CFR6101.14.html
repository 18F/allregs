                            <p class="depth0">Upon order from the Board permitting such discovery, a party may  serve on another party written interrogatories, requests for admission,  and requests for production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written interrogatories. Written interrogatories shall be  answered separately in writing, signed under oath or accompanied by a  declaration under penalty of perjury, and answered within 30 calendar  days after service. Objections shall be filed within the time limits set  forth in 6101.13(f)(2) (Rule 13(f)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Option to produce business records. Where the answer to an  interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of  the party upon which the interrogatory has been served, or from an  examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, including a  compilation, abstract, or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or  ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving  the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to  such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be  derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the  interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such  records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries  thereof. Such specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the  interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the  party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> is  for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission for  any other purpose, nor may it be used against the party in any other  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written requests for production. A written request for the  production, inspection, and copying of any documents, electronically  stored information, or things shall be answered within 30 calendar days  after service. Objections shall be filed within the time limits set  forth in 6101.13(f)(2) [Rule 13(f)(2)].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Change in time for response. Upon request of a party, or on its  own initiative, the Board may prescribe a period of time other than that  specified in 6101.14 (Rule 14).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Responses. A party that has responded to written  interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for production of  documents, electronically stored information, or things, upon becoming  aware of deficiencies or inaccuracies in its original responses, or upon  acquiring additional information or additional documents, electronically  stored information, or things relevant thereto, shall, as quickly as  practicable, and as often as necessary, supplement its responses to the  requesting party with correct and sufficient additional information and  such additional documents, electronically stored information, and things  as are necessary to give a complete and accurate response to the  request.
