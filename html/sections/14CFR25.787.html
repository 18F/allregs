If the airplane has a passenger-seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 10 seats or more, each stowage compartment in the passenger cabin, except for under seat and overhead compartments for passenger convenience, must be completely enclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There must be a means to prevent the contents in the compartments from becoming a hazard by shifting, under the loads specified in paragraph (a) of this section. For stowage compartments in the passenger and crew cabin, if the means used is a latched door, the design must take into consideration the wear and deterioration expected in service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If cargo compartment lamps are installed, each lamp must be installed so as to prevent contact between lamp bulb and cargo.
