                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General conditions. Prior to the STD obtaining final environmental approval, the STD may request FHWA agreement to provide reimbursement for advance acquisition of a particular parcel or a limited number of parcels, to prevent imminent development and increased costs on the preferred location (Protective Buying), or to alleviate hardship to a property owner or owners on the preferred location (Hardship Acquisition), provided the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project is included in the currently approved STIP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The STD has complied with applicable public involvement requirements in 23 CFR parts 450 and 771;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A determination has been completed for any property subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 138; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation are completed for properties subject to 16 U.S.C. 470(f) (historic properties).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protective buying. The STD must clearly demonstrate that development of the property is imminent and such development would limit future transportation choices. A significant increase in cost may be considered as an element justifying a protective purchase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hardship acquisitions. The STD must accept and concur in a request for a hardship acquisition based on a property owner's written submission that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supports the hardship acquisition by providing justification, on the basis of health, safety or financial reasons, that remaining in the property poses an undue hardship compared to others; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documents an inability to sell the property because of the impending

project, at fair market value, within a time period that is typical for properties not impacted by the impending project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Environmental decisions. Acquisition of property under this section shall not influence the environmental assessment of a project, including the decision relative to the need to construct the project or the selection of a specific location.</p>
