                            <p class="depth0">An applicant may apply for market-based rates by filing a request  for a market-power determination that complies with the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The applicant must set forth its specific request and adequately  demonstrate that it lacks market power in the market to be served, and  must include an executive summary of its statement of position and a  statement of material facts in addition to its complete statement of  position. The   statement of material facts must include citation to the supporting  statements, exhibits, affidavits, and prepared testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant must include with its application the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Statement A--geographic market. This statement must describe the  geographic markets for storage services in which the applicant seeks to  establish that it lacks significant market power. It must include the  market related to the service for which it proposes to charge market- based rates. The statement must explain why the applicant's method for  selecting the geographic markets is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement B--product market. This statement must identify the  product market or markets for which the applicant seeks to establish  that it lacks significant market power. The statement must explain why  the particular product definition is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Statement C--the applicant's facilities and services. This  statement must describe the applicant's own facilities and services, and  those of all parent, subsidiary, or affiliated companies, in the  relevant markets identified in Statements A and B in paragraphs (b)(1)  and (2) of this section. The statement must include all pertinent data  about the storage facilities and services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Statement D--competitive alternatives. This statement must  describe available alternatives in competition with the applicant in the  relevant markets and other competition constraining the applicant's  rates in those markets. Such proposed alternatives may include an  appropriate combination of other storage, local gas supply, LNG,  financial instruments and pipeline capacity. These alternatives must be  shown to be reasonably available as a substitute in the area to be  served soon enough, at a price low enough, and with a quality high  enough to be a reasonable alternative to the applicant's services.  Capacity (transportation, storage, LNG, or production) owned or  controlled by the applicant and affiliates of the applicant in the  relevant market shall be clearly and fully identified and may not be  considered as alternatives competing with the applicant. Rather, the  capacity of an applicant's affiliates is to be included in the market  share calculated for the applicant. To the extent available, the  statement must include all pertinent data about storage or other  alternatives and other constraining competition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Statement E--potential competition. This statement must describe  potential competition in the relevant markets. To the extent available,  the statement must include data about the potential competitors,  including their costs, and their distance in miles from the applicant's  facilities and major consuming markets. This statement must also  describe any relevant barriers to entry and the applicant's assessment  of whether ease of entry is an effective counter to attempts to exercise  market power in the relevant markets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Statement F--maps. This statement must consist of maps showing  the applicant's principal facilities, pipelines to which the applicant  intends to interconnect and other pipelines within the area to be  served, the direction of flow of each line, the location of the  alternatives to the applicant's service offerings, including their  distance in miles from the applicant's facility. The statement must  include a general system map and maps by geographic markets. The  information required by this statement may be on separate pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Statement G--market-power measures. This statement must set  forth the calculation of the market concentration of the relevant  markets using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. The statement must also  set forth the applicant's market share, inclusive of affiliated service  offerings, in the markets to be served. The statement must also set  forth the calculation of other market-power measures relied on by the  applicant. The statement must include complete particulars about the  applicant's calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Statement H--other factors. This statement must describe any  other factors that bear on the issue of whether the applicant lacks  significant market power in the relevant markets. The description must  explain why those other factors are pertinent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Statement I--prepared testimony. This statement must include the  proposed testimony in support of the application and will serve as the  applicant's case-in-chief, if the Commission sets the application for  hearing. The proposed witness must subscribe to the testimony and swear  that all statements of fact contained in the proposed testimony are true  and correct to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and  belief.</p>
