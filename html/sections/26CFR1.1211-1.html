The rules provided by this subparagraph are for the purpose of computing the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of section 1212(b)(3) and this subparagraph. More specifically, their operation permits the limited use of a long-term capital loss carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before December 31, 1969, in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis in computing the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year. These rules have no application to, or effect upon, a determination of the character or amount of capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) reportable in the taxable year. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.1212-1 for the determination of the amount and character of capital gains and losses reportable in the taxable year. Further, except to the extent that their application may affect the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year and thus the amount to be treated as short-term capital loss for carryover purposes under section 1212(b) and Sec. 1.1212-1(b)(2), these rules have no effect upon a determination of the character or amount of capital losses carried to or from the taxable year pursuant to section 1212(b) and Sec. 1.1212-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Order of application of capital losses to additional allowance or transitional additional allowance. In applying the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain and the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain to the additional allowance or transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) and this paragraph, such excesses shall, subject to the limitations of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, be used in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First, there shall be applied to the additional allowance or transitional

additional allowance the excess, if any, of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, if such transitional additional allowance exceeds the amount so applied thereto as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, there shall next be applied thereto as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain to the extent of the transitional net long-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Third, if such additional allowance or transitional additional allowance exceeds the sum of the amounts so applied thereto as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, there shall be applied thereto one-half of the balance, if any, of the excess net long-term capital loss not applied pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1970. For any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1970, subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed as a deduction only to the extent of gains from such sales or exchanges, plus (if such losses exceed such gains) the taxable income of the taxpayer or $1,000, whichever is smaller.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rules. (i) For purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph, taxable income is to be computed without regard to gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets and without regard to the deductions provided in section 151 (relating to personal exemptions) or any deduction in lieu thereof. For example, the deductions available to estates and trusts under section 642(b) are in lieu of the deductions allowed under section 151, and, in the case of estates and trusts, are to be added back to taxable income for the purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph, taxable income is to be computed without regard to gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets and without regard to the deductions provided in section 151 (relating to personal exemptions) or any deduction in lieu thereof. For example, the deductions available to estates and trusts under section 642(b) are in lieu of the deductions allowed under section 151, and, in the case of estates and trusts, are to be added back to taxable income for the purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, in case the tax is computed under section 3 and the regulations thereunder (relating to optional tax tables for individuals), the term taxable income as used in section 1211(b) and this paragraph shall be read as adjusted gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a joint return, the limitation under section 1211(b) and this paragraph, relating to the allowance of losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, is to be computed and the net capital loss determined with respect to the combined taxable income and the combined capital gains and losses of the spouses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Married taxpayers filing separate returns--(i) In general. In the case of a husband or a wife who files a separate return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000 amounts specified in subparagraphs (2)(ii) and (3)(i)(b) of this paragraph shall instead be $1,500, $1,000, and $500, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a husband or a wife who files a separate return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000 amounts specified in subparagraphs (2)(ii) and (3)(i)(b) of this paragraph shall instead be $1,500, $1,000, and $500, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule. If, pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.1212-1(b) and subparagraph (3) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph, there is carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a short-term capital loss or a long-term capital loss, the $1,500, $1,000 and $500 amounts specified in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall instead be maximum amounts of $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000 respectively, equal to $1,500, $1,000, and $500, respectively, plus the total of the transitional net long-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph and the transitional net short-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subparagraph (3)(iv) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The provisions of section 1211(b) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, an unmarried individual with one exemption allowable as a deduction under section 151, has the following transactions in 1970:
Taxable income exclusive of capital gains and losses.........     $4,400Deduction provided by section 151............................        625</p><p class="depth0">------------Taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b)...............      5,025Long-term capital gain............................     $1,200Long-term capital loss............................

(1,200)Additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b)........      1,000</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0">The net long-term capital loss of $4,100 is deductible in 1970 only to the extent of an additional allowance of $1,000 which is smaller than the taxable income of $5,025. Under section 1211(b) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, $2,000 of excess net long-term capital loss was required to produce the $1,000 additional allowance. Therefore, a net long-term capital loss of $2,100 ($4,100 minus $2,000) is carried over under section 1212(b) to the succeeding taxable year. If A had the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transactions in 1977, the additional allowance would be $2,000, and a net long-term capital loss of $100 would be carried over. For a taxable year beginning in 1978 or thereafter, these facts would give rise to a $2,050 additional allowance and no carryover.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, an unmarried individual with one exemption allowable as a deduction under section 151, has the following transactions in 1970:

(1,200)Additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b)........        715</p><p class="depth0">==========</p><p class="depth0">The net long-term capital loss of $4,000 is deductible in 1970 only to the extent of an additional allowance of $715, since the $715 of taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) is smaller than $1,000. Under section 1211(b) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, $1,430 of net long-term capital loss was required to produce the $715 additional allowance. Therefore, a net long-term capital loss of $2,570 ($4,000 minus $1,430) is carried over under section 1212(b) to the succeeding taxable year. For illustration of the result if the net capital loss for the taxable year is smaller than both $1,000 and taxable income for the purposes of section 1211(b), see examples (3) and (4) of this subparagraph. For carryover of a net capital loss, see Sec. 1.1212-1. Assuming the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transations for taxable years beginning in 1977 or thereafter, the same result would be reached.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A, an unmarried individual with one exemption allowable as a deduction under section 151, has the following transactions in 1971:

The $600 additional allowance, therefore, consists of the net short-term capital loss of $500, plus $100 (one-half of the net long-term capital loss of $200), the total of which is smaller than both $1,000 and taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b). No amount of net capital loss remains to be carried over under section 1212(b) to the succeeding taxable year since the entire amount of the net short-term capital loss of $500 plus the entire amount of the net long-term capital loss of $200 required to produce $100 of the deduction was absorbed by the additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for 1971. Assuming the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transactions for taxable years beginning in 1977 or thereafter, the result would remain unchanged.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

Since there is no net short-term capital loss in excess of net long-term capital gains for the taxable year, the $200 additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) consists entirely of excess net long-term capital loss. No amount of net capital loss remains to be carried over under section 1212(b) to the succeeding taxable year.

The $1,000 additional allowance, therefore, consists of net long-term capital loss. Since $2,000 of the net long-term capital loss of $4,000 was required to produce the $1,000 additional allowance, the $2,000 balance of the net long-term capital loss is carried over under section 1212(b) to 1971.

The entire $500 long-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969 is applicable in full to the transitional additional allowance because there was no net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) actually realized in 1970. The $1,000 transitional additional allowance, therefore, consists of the net short-term capital loss of $300, the $500 long-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969, plus one-half of enough of the balance of the 1970 net long-term capital loss ($400) to make up the $200 balance of the $1,000 transitional additional allowance. A long-term capital loss of $1,600 ($2,500 minus $900), all of which is attributable to 1970, is carried over under section 1212(b) to 1971.

The entire $500 long-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969 is applicable in full to the transitional additional allowance because the net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) for the taxable year (computed without regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) consisted entirely of net short-term capital gain not in excess of the short-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969. The $1,000 transitional additional allowance, therefore, consists of the net short-term capital loss of $400, the $500 long-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969, plus one-half of enough of the balance of the 1970 net long-term capital loss ($200) to make up the $100 balance of the $1,000 transitional additional allowance. A long-term capital loss of $1,800 ($2,500 minus $700), all of which is attributable to 1970, is carried over under section 1212(b) to 1971. Assuming the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transactions for taxable years beginning in 1977 or thereafter, the transitional additional allowance would be $1,900. No amount would remain to be carried over to the succeeding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the facts in Example (7) but assume that the individual with one exemption allowable as a deduction under section 151 is married and files a separate return for 1970. The maximum transitional additional allowance to which the individual would be entitled for 1970 pursuant to subparagraph (7)(ii) of this paragraph would be the sum of $500 plus (i) $2,400 of the short-term capital loss of $3,000 carried to 1970 from 1969 (the amount by which such carryover exceeds the $600 net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) actually realized in 1970, all of which is net short-term capital gain) and (ii) the $500 long-term capital loss carried to 1970 from 1969. However, since this sum ($3,400) exceeds $1,000, the maximum transitional additional allowance to which the individual is entitled for 1970 is limited to $1,000. If for 1971, the same married individual had taxable income of $13,925 for purposes of section 1211(b) and no capital transactions, and filed a separate return, the additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for 1971 would be limited to $500 by reason of subdivision (i) of subparagraph (7) of this paragraph, since, as illustrated in Example 7, no part of the capital loss carried over to 1971 under section 1212 (b) is attributable to 1969. Assuming the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transactions as in example (7) for a married individual filing a separate return for a taxable year beginning in 1977 or thereafter, the transitional additional allowance would be $1,900. No amount would remain to be carried over to the succeeding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9.

The transitional net long-term capital loss component for 1971 under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph is $1,800, that is, the amount by which

the $5,000 long-term loss treated as carried over from 1969 to 1971 exceeds (a) the net long-term capital gain of $2,500 actually realized in 1971 plus (b) the $700 excess of the $2,700 net short-term capital gain actually realized in 1971 over the $2,000 short-term capital loss treated as carried over to 1971 from 1969. The transitional additional allowance for 1971 consists of the $300 net short-term capital loss plus $700 of the net long-term capital loss attributable to 1969. A net long-term capital loss of $1,800 ($2,500 minus $700) is carried over to 1972 under section 1212(b). Only $1,100 of the $1,800 will be treated in 1972 as carried over from 1969 since under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph the transitional net long-term capital loss component of $1,800 is reduced by the amount ($700) applied to the transitional additional allowance for 1971. Assuming the same taxable income for purposes of section 1211(b) (after reduction by the zero bracket amount) and the same transactions for a taxable year beginning in 1977, the transitional additional allowance would be $2,000. A net long-term capital loss of $800 would remain to be carried over. Of this amount $100 would be treated as carried over from 1969. Assuming the original facts for a taxable year beginning in 1978, the transitional additional allowance would be $2,450. No amount would remain to be carried over to the succeeding taxable year.
