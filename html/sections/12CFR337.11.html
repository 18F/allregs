Compliance with the provisions of this part shall not relieve an insured State nonmember bank from its duty to conduct its operations in a safe and sound manner nor prevent the Corporation from taking whatever action it deems necessary and desirable to deal with specific acts or practices which, although they do not violate the provisions of this part, are considered detrimental to the safety and sound operation of the bank engaged therein.</p>
