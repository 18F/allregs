                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Priority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors on  Federal property shall be afforded when the Secretary determines, on an  individual basis, and after consultation with the appropriate property  managing department, agency, or instrumentality, that such operation can  be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable  to that currently provided employees, whether by contract or otherwise.  Such operation shall be expected to provide maximum employment  opportunities to blind vendors to the greatest extent possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a  cafeteria in such a manner as to provide food service at comparable cost  and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of  cafeteria services, the appropriate State licensing agency shall be  invited to respond to solicitations for offers when a cafeteria contract  is contemplated by the appropriate property managing department, agency,  or instrumentality. Such solicitations for offers shall establish  criteria under which all responses will be judged. Such criteria may  include sanitation practices, personnel, staffing, menu pricing and  portion sizes, menu variety, budget and accounting practices. If the  proposal received from the State licensing agency is judged to be within  a competitive range and has been ranked among those proposals which have  a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, the property  managing department, agency, or instrumentality shall consult with the  Secretary as required under paragraph (a) of this section. If the State  licensing agency is dissatisfied with an action taken relative to its  proposal, it may file a complaint with the Secretary under the  provisions of Sec. 395.37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All contracts or other existing arrangements pertaining to the  operation of cafeterias on Federal property not covered by contract  with, or by permits issued to, State licensing agencies shall be  renegotiated subsequent to the effective date of this part on or before  the expiration of such contracts or other arrangements pursuant to the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section, Federal property managing departments, agencies, and  instrumentalities may afford priority in the operation of cafeterias by  blind vendors on   Federal property through direct negotiations with State licensing  agencies whenever such department, agency, or instrumentality  determines, on an individual basis, that such operation can be provided  at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality comparable to that  currently provided employees: Provided, however, That the provisions of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply in the event that the  negotiations authorized by this paragraph do not result in a contract.</p>
