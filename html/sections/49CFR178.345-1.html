The device must break under strain at no more than 70 percent of the strength of the weakest piping element between the cargo tank and the sacrificial device. Operation of the sacrificial device must leave the remaining piping and its attachment to the cargo tank intact and capable of retaining lading.</p><p class="depth2">Self-closing stop-valve means a stop-valve held in the closed position by means of self-stored energy, which opens only by application of an external force and which closes when the external force is removed.</p><p class="depth2">Shear section means a sacrificial device fabricated in such a manner as to abruptly reduce the wall thickness of the adjacent piping or valve material by at least 30 percent.</p><p class="depth2">Shell means the circumferential portion of a cargo tank defined by the basic design radius or radii excluding the closing heads.</p><p class="depth2">Stop-valve means a valve that stops the flow of lading.</p><p class="depth2">Sump means a protrusion from the bottom of a cargo tank shell designed to facilitate complete loading and unloading of lading.</p><p class="depth2">Tank means a container, consisting of a shell and heads, that forms a pressure tight vessel having openings designed to accept pressure tight fittings or closures, but excludes any appurtenances, reinforcements, fittings, or closures.</p><p class="depth2">Test pressure means the pressure to which a tank is subjected to determine pressure integrity.</p><p class="depth2">Toughness of material means the capability of a material to absorb the energy represented by the area under the stress strain curve (indicating the energy absorbed per unit volume of the material) up to the point of rupture.</p><p class="depth2">Vacuum cargo tank means a cargo tank that is loaded by reducing the pressure in the cargo tank to below atmospheric pressure.</p><p class="depth2">Variable specification cargo tank means a cargo tank that is constructed in accordance with one specification,
