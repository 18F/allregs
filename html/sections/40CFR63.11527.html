                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EAF equipped with fabric filters--(1) Visual monitoring. You must conduct visual monitoring of the monovent or fabric filter outlet stack(s) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visual monitoring. You must conduct visual monitoring of the monovent or fabric filter outlet stack(s) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Daily visual monitoring. Perform visual determination of fugitive emissions once per day, on each day the process is in operation, during operation of the process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Weekly visual monitoring. If no visible fugitive emissions are detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring performed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for 90 days of operation of the process, you may decrease the frequency of visual monitoring to once per calendar week of time the process is in operation, during operation of the process. If visible fugitive emissions are detected during these inspections, you must resume daily visual monitoring of that operation during each day that the process is in operation, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section until you satisfy the criteria of this section to resume conducting weekly visual monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40

CFR part 60) test following the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the presence of any VE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you own or operate an existing affected source, you may install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system for each fabric filter as an alternative to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If you own or operate a new affected source, you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system for each fabric filter according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(vii) of this section. Such source is not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting emissions of PM at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings and the owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using a strip chart recorder, data logger, or other means.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The system must be equipped with an alarm that will sound when an increase in relative PM loadings is detected over the alarm set point established in the operation and maintenance plan, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard, seen, or otherwise detected by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The initial adjustment of the system must, at minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set points. If the system is equipped with an alarm delay time feature, you also must establish a maximum reasonable alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Following the initial adjustment, do not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time, except that, once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature and humidity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For fabric filters that are discharged to the atmosphere through a stack, the bag leak detector sensor must be installed downstream of the fabric filter and upstream of any wet scrubber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When operating a bag leak detection system, if an alarm sounds, conduct visual monitoring of the monovent or fabric filter outlet stack(s) as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 1 hour. If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must conduct a Method 22 test following the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the presence of any VE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain each bag leak detection system according to the plan at all times. Each plan must address all of the items identified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(v)of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point and alarm delay time will be established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Maintenance of the bag leak detection system including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EAF equipped with wet scrubbers--(1) Visual monitoring. You must conduct visual monitoring of the wet scrubber outlet stack(s) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visual monitoring. You must conduct visual monitoring of the wet scrubber outlet stack(s) for any VE according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Daily visual monitoring. Perform visual determination of fugitive emissions once per day, on each day the process is in operation, during operation of the process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Weekly visual monitoring. If no visible fugitive emissions are detected in consecutive daily visual monitoring

performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for 90 days of operation of the process, you may decrease the frequency of visual monitoring to once per calendar week of time the process is in operation, during operation of the process. If visible fugitive emissions are detected during these inspections, you must resume daily visual monitoring of that operation during each day that the process is in operation, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section until you satisfy the criteria of this section to resume conducting weekly visual monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the presence of any VE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you own or operate an existing affected source, you may install, operate and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) to measure and record the 3-hour average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate as an alternative to the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If you own or operate a new sealed EAF affected source, you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS for each wet scrubber. Such source is not subject to the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When operating a CPMS, if the 3-hour average pressure drop or scrubber water flow rate is below the minimum levels that indicate normal operation of the control device, conduct visual monitoring of the outlet stack(s) as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 1 hour of determining that the 3-hour average parameter value is below the required minimum levels. Manufacturer's specifications for pressure drop and liquid flow rate will be used to determine normal operations. If the visual monitoring reveals the presence of any VE, you must conduct a Method 22 (appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60) test following the requirements of Sec. 63.11528(b)(1) within 24 hours of determining the presence of any VE.</p>
