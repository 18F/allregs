                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. Licenses or approvals shall be denied or revoked whenever required by any statute of the United States (see Sec. Sec. 127.7 and 127.11 of this subchapter). Any application for an export license or other approval under this subchapter may be disapproved, and any license or other approval or exemption granted under this subchapter may be revoked, suspended, or amended without prior notice whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Department of State deems such action to be in furtherance of world peace, the national security or the foreign policy of the United States, or is otherwise advisable; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department of State believes that 22 U.S.C. 2778, any regulation contained in this subchapter, or the terms of any U.S. Government export authorization (including the terms of a manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement, or export authorization granted pursuant to the Export Administration Act, as amended) has been violated by any party to the export or other person having significant interest in the transaction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An applicant is the subject of a criminal complaint, other criminal charge (e.g., an information), or indictment for a violation of any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in Sec. 120.27 of this subchapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An applicant or any party to the export or the agreement has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in Sec. 120.27 of this subchapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An applicant is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other authorization to import defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S. Government; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An applicant, any party to the export or agreement, any source or manufacturer of the defense article or defense service or any person who has a significant interest in the transaction has been debarred, suspended, or otherwise is ineligible to receive an export license or other authorization from any agency of the U.S. government (e.g., pursuant to debarment by the Department of Commerce under 15 CFR part 760 or by the Department of State under part 127 or 128 of this subchapter); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An applicant has failed to include any of the information or documentation expressly required to support a license application, exemption, or other request for approval under this subchapter, or as required in the instructions in the applicable Department of State form or has failed to provide notice or information as required under this subchapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An applicant is subject to sanctions under other relevant U.S. laws (e.g., the Missile Technology Controls title of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510); the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-182); or the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-484)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls will notify applicants or licensees or other appropriate United States persons of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The reasons for the action will

be stated as specifically as security and foreign policy considerations permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration of an adverse decision is made within 30 days after a person has been informed of the decision, the U.S. person will be accorded an opportunity to present additional information. The case will then be reviewed by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reconsideration of certain applications. Applications for licenses or other requests for approval denied for repeated failure to provide information or documentation expressly required will normally not be reconsidered during the thirty day period following denial. They will be reconsidered after this period only after a final decision is made on whether the applicant will be subject to an administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this subchapter. Any request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a letter explaining the steps that have been taken to correct the failure and to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special definition. For purposes of this subchapter, the term ``party to the export'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers and officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) and any member of the board of directors of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the applicant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported.
