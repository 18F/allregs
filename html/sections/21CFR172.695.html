                            <p class="depth0">The food additive xanthan gum may be safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The additive is a polysaccharide gum derived from Xanthomonas campestris by a pure-culture fermentation process and purified by recovery with isopropyl alcohol. It contains D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-glucuronic acid as the dominant hexose units and is manufactured as the sodium, potassium, or calcium salt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The strain of Xanthomonas campestris is nonpathogenic and nontoxic in man or other animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The additive is produced by a process that renders it free of viable cells of Xanthomonas campestris.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The additive meets the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Residual isopropyl alcohol not to exceed 750 parts per million.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An aqueous solution containing 1 percent of the additive and 1 percent of potassium chloride stirred for 2 hours has a minimum viscosity of 600 centipoises at 75 [deg]F, as determined by Brookfield Viscometer, Model LVF (or equivalent), using a No. 3 spindle at 60 r.p.m., and the ratio of viscosities at 75 [deg]F and 150 [deg]F is in the range of 1.02 to 1.45.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Positive for xanthan gum when subjected to the following procedure:</p><p class="depth3">Locust Bean Gum Gel Test</p><p class="depth3">Blend on a weighing paper or in a weighing pan 1.0 gram of powdered locust bean gum with 1.0 gram of the powdered polysaccharide to be tested. Add the blend slowly (approximately \1/2\ minute) at the point of maximum agitation to a stirred solution of 200 milliliters of distilled water previously heated to

80 [deg]C in a 400-milliliter beaker. Continue mechanical stirring until the mixture is in solution, but stir for a minimum time of 30 minutes. Do not allow the water temperature to drop below 60 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth3">Set the beaker and its contents aside to cool in the absence of agitation. Allow a minimum time of 2 hours for cooling. Examine the cooled beaker contents for a firm rubbery gel formation after the temperature drops below 40 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth3">In the event that a gel is obtained, make up a 1 percent solution of the polysaccharide to be tested in 200 milliliters of distilled water previously heated to 80 [deg]C (omit the locust bean gum). Allow the solution to cool without agitation as before. Formation of a gel on cooling indicates that the sample is a gelling polysaccharide and not xanthan gum.</p><p class="depth3">Record the sample as ``positive'' for xanthan gum if a firm, rubbery gel forms in the presence of locust bean gum but not in its absence. Record the sample as ``negative'' for xanthan gum if no gel forms or if a soft or brittle gel forms both with locust bean gum and in a 1 percent solution of the sample (containing no locust bean gum).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Positive for xanthan gum when subjected to the following procedure:</p><p class="depth3">Pyruvic Acid Test</p><p class="depth3">Pipet 10 milliliters of an 0.6 percent solution of the polysaccharide in distilled water (60 milligrams of water-soluble gum) into a 50-milliliter flask equipped with a standard taper glass joint. Pipet in 20 milliliters of 1N hydrochloric acid. Weigh the flask. Reflux the mixture for 3 hours. Take precautions to avoid loss of vapor during the refluxing. Cool the solution to room temperature. Add distilled water to make up any weight loss from the flask contents.</p><p class="depth3">Pipet 1 milliliter of a 2,4-dinitro phenyl hydrazine reagent (0.5 percent in 2N hydrochloric acid) into a 30-milliliter separatory funnel followed by a 2-milliliter aliquot (4 milligrams of water-soluble gum) of the polysaccharide hydrolyzate. Mix and allow the reaction mixture to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Extract the mixture with 5 milliliters of ethyl acetate. Discard the aqueous layer.</p><p class="depth3">Extract the hydrazone from the ethyl acetate with three 5 milliliter portions of 10 percent sodium carbonate solution. Dilute the combined sodium carbonate extracts to 100 milliliters with additional 10 percent sodium carbonate in a 10-milliliter volumetric flask. Measure the optical density of the sodium carbonate solution at 375 millimicrons.</p><p class="depth3">Compare the results with a curve of the optical density versus concentration of an authentic sample of pyruvic acid that has been run through the procedure starting with the preparation of the hydrazone.</p><p class="depth3">Record the percent by weight of pyruvic acid in the test polysaccharide. Note ``positive'' for xanthan gum if the sample contains more than 1.5 percent of pyruvic acid and ``negative'' for xanthan gum if the sample contains less than 1.5 percent of pyruvic acid by weight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The additive is used or intended for use in accordance with good manufacturing practice as a stabilizer, emulsifier, thickener, suspending agent, bodying agent, or foam enhancer in foods for which standards of identity established under section 401 of the Act do not preclude such use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To assure safe use of the additive:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The label of its container shall bear, in addition to other information required by the Act, the name of the additive and the designation ``food grade''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label or labeling of the food additive container shall bear adequate directions for use.</p>
