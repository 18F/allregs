                            <p class="depth0">The section 13(d) exemption does not apply when the wreaths are made in or about a place which is not considered a ``home''. Careful consideration is required in many cases to determine whether work is being performed in or about a home. Thus, the circumstances under which an employee may engage in work in what ostensibly is a ``home'' may require the conclusion, on an examination of all the facts, that the work is not being performed in or about a home within the intent of the term and for purposes of section 13(d) of the Act.</p>
