If CCC determines that the producer has violated the terms and conditions of the applicable forms prescribed by CCC, liquidated damages will be assessed on the quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such violations as referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incorrect certification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unauthorized removal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unauthorized disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the county committee determines that the producer has committed such violations, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of the commodity that is involved in the violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liquidated damages assessed in accordance with this section will be determined by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 10 percent of the marketing assistance loan rate applicable to the loan note.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When it has been determined that a violation of the terms and conditions of the note and security agreement has occurred as a result of unauthorized removal or disposition, CCC will determine the quantity of the commodity involved with respect to such violation and require the repayment of that portion of the marketing assistance loan which is equivalent to such quantity of the commodity. In the case of these violations, if CCC determines the producer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages shall be assessed according to paragraph (d) of this section and the commodity involved in the violation must be redeemed at the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rate at which the loan was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alternative repayment rate in effect on the date of the determination is issued by CCC that a violation has occurred, plus 15 percent of the original loan rate as provided on the note and security agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Did not act in good faith when the violation was committed, liquidated damages shall be assessed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and administrative actions shall be taken in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

In the case of an incorrect certification, if CCC determines the producer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acted in good faith when the violation occurred, liquidated damages shall be assessed according to paragraph (d) of this section, and the commodity involved in the violation must be redeemed at the rate at which the loan was disbursed, plus interest and any other charges assessed under the note and security agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Did not act in good faith about the violation, liquidated damages shall

be assessed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and administrative actions shall be taken in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
