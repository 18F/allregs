                                Sec. 123.11  Does SBA require collateral for any of its disaster loans?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When collateral is not required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Economic injury disaster loans. Generally, SBA will not require  that you pledge collateral to secure an economic injury disaster loan of  $25,000 or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physical disaster home and physical disaster business loans. SBA  will not require that you pledge collateral to secure a physical  disaster home or physical disaster business loan of $14,000 or less. In  addition, under a Major Disaster, SBA generally will not require that  you pledge collateral to secure a physical disaster home or physical  disaster business loan of $25,000 or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> IDAP loans. Collateral requirements for IDAP loans are set forth  in Subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Military Reservist EIDL. For the purposes of the Military  Reservist EIDL only, as described in section 123.513, SBA will not  generally require that you pledge collateral to secure a loan of $50,000  or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For loans larger than the amounts outlined in paragraph (a) of  this section, you will be required to provide available collateral such  as a lien on the damaged or replacement property, a security interest in  personal/business property, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sometimes a borrower, including affiliates as defined in part  121 of this title, will have more than one loan after a single disaster.  In deciding whether collateral is required, SBA will add up all physical  disaster loans to see if they exceed the applicable unsecured threshold  outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and all economic injury  disaster loans to see if they exceed $25,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SBA will not decline a loan if you lack a particular amount of  collateral as long as it is reasonably sure that you can repay your  loan. If you refuse to pledge available collateral when requested by  SBA, however, SBA may decline or cancel your loan.
