                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The procedures in this section shall only apply after a subscriber has determined that an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(e), has occurred and the subscriber has paid charges to an allegedly unauthorized carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the relevant governmental agency determines after reasonable investigation that an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(e), has occurred, it shall issue an order directing the unauthorized carrier to forward to the authorized carrier the following, in addition to any appropriate state remedies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An amount equal to 150% of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Copies of any telephone bills issued from the unauthorized carrier to

the subscriber. This order shall be sent to the subscriber, the unauthorized carrier, and the authorized carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within ten days of receipt of the amount provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the authorized carrier shall provide a refund or credit to the subscriber in the amount of 50% of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. The subscriber has the option of asking the authorized carrier to re-rate the unauthorized carrier's charges based on the rates of the authorized carrier and, on behalf of the subscriber, seek an additional refund from the unauthorized carrier, to the extent that the re-rated amount exceeds the 50% of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier. The authorized carrier shall also send notice to the relevant governmental agency that it has given a refund or credit to the subscriber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an authorized carrier incurs billing and collection expenses in collecting charges from the unauthorized carrier, the unauthorized carrier shall reimburse the authorized carrier for reasonable expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the authorized carrier has not received payment from the unauthorized carrier as required by paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized carrier is not required to provide any refund or credit to the subscriber. The authorized carrier must, within 45 days of receiving an order as described in paragraph (b) of this section, inform the subscriber and the relevant governmental agency that issued the order if the unauthorized carrier has failed to forward to it the appropriate charges, and also inform the subscriber of his or her right to pursue a claim against the unauthorized carrier for a refund of all charges paid to the unauthorized carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where possible, the properly authorized carrier must reinstate the subscriber in any premium program in which that subscriber was enrolled prior to the unauthorized change, if the subscriber's participation in that program was terminated because of the unauthorized change. If the subscriber has paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the properly authorized carrier shall also provide or restore to the subscriber any premiums to which the subscriber would have been entitled had the unauthorized change not occurred. The authorized carrier must comply with the requirements of this section regardless of whether it is able to recover from the unauthorized carrier any charges that were paid by the subscriber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When a LEC has assigned a subscriber to a non-affiliated carrier without authorization, and when a subscriber has paid the non-affiliated carrier the charges for the billed service, the LEC shall reimburse the subscriber for all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier and shall switch the subscriber to the desired carrier at no cost to the subscriber. When a LEC makes an unauthorized carrier change to an affiliated carrier, and when the customer has paid the charges, the LEC must pay to the authorized carrier 150% of the amounts collected from the subscriber in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
