The Director shall consider such information in making a  determination of notify the warehouseman in writing of such  determination.

The time of filing appeals, forms for requesting an appeal,  nature of the informal hearing, determination and reopening of the  hearing shall be as prescribed in the FSA regulations governing appeals,  7 CFR part 780.
