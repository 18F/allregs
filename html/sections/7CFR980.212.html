                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Findings and determinations with respect to fresh tomatoes. (1) Under Section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), it is hereby found that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grade, size, quality and maturity regulations have been issued from time to time under Marketing Order No. 966, as amended;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The marketing of fresh tomatoes from Florida covered by Marketing Order No. 966, as amended, can reasonably be expected to occur during the months of October through June;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Therefore, it is hereby determined that imports of fresh tomatoes during the months of October through June are in most direct competition with the marketing of fresh tomatoes produced in Florida covered by Marketing Order No. 966, as amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grade, size, quality and maturity requirements. On and after the effective date hereof no person may import fresh tomatoes except pear shaped, cherry, hydroponic and greenhouse tomatoes as defined herein, or tomatoes to be used in noncommercial outlets for experimental purposes, unless they are inspected and meet the following requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> From October 10 through June 15 of each season, tomatoes offered for importation shall be at least 2\9/32\ inches in diameter. Not more than 10 percent, by count, in any lot may be smaller than the minimum specified diameter. All lots of tomatoes shall be at least U.S. No. 2 grade. Provided, That UglyRipe \TM\ and Vintage Ripes \TM\ tomatoes shall be graded and at least meet the requirements specified for U.S. No. 2 under the U.S. Standards for Grades of Fresh Tomatoes, except they are exempt from the requirements that they be reasonably well formed and not more than slightly rough, and Provided, Further that the UglyRipe \TM\ and Vintage Ripes \TM\ tomatoes meet the requirements of the Identity Preservation program, Fresh Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to importation of tomatoes to be used in noncommercial outlets for experimental purposes, the importer shall apply for and obtain from the Vegetable Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, an approved Certificate for Special Purpose Shipment, complete Part I and comply with all procedures specified thereon. A separate certificate is required for each shipment. Three copies of the certificate shall accompany shipment, of which one copy shall be surrendered to the Federal or Federal-State Inspector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the port of entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon completion of shipment receiver making final disposition of the tomatoes shall complete Part II of the Certificate. Importer shall be responsible for the return, within 10 days, of a signed copy of the certificate to the Chief, Vegetable Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, certifying that the tomatoes were used for the purpose specified thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum quantity exemption. Any importation which in the aggregate does not exceed 60 pounds may be imported without regard to the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Plant quarantine. Provisions of this section shall not supersede the restrictions or prohibitions on tomatoes under the Plant Quarantine Act of 1912.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Designation of governmental inspection service. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food of Plant Origin Division, Plant Products Directorate, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, are

hereby designated as governmental inspection services for the purpose of certifying the grade, size, quality, and maturity of tomatoes that are imported, or to be imported, into the United States under the provisions of section 8e of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Inspection and official inspection certificates. (1) An official inspection certificate certifying the tomatoes meet the United States import requirements for tomatoes under Section 8e (7 U.S.C. 608e-1), issued by a designated governmental inspection service and applicable to a specified lot is required on all imports of fresh tomatoes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inspection and certification by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will be available and performed in accordance with the rules and regulations governing certification of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products (7 CFR part 51). Each lot shall be made available and accessible for inspection as provided therein. Cost of inspection and certification shall be borne by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Since the inspectors may not be stationed in the immediate vicinity of some smaller ports of entry, importers should make advance arrangements for inspection by ascertaining whether or not there is an inspector located at their particular port of entry. For all ports of entry where an inspection office is not located, each importer must give the specified advance notice to the applicable office listed below prior to the time the tomatoes will be imported.
