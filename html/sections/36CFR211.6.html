                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. Forest Service officers, when engaged in  cooperative activities otherwise authorized, may receive monies from  cooperators only for cooperative work in forest investigations or for  the protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest  System and only in accordance with written cooperative agreements.  Management of the National Forest System may include such work as  planning, analysis, and related studies, as well as resource activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursements. Agency expenditures for work undertaken in  accordance with this section may be made from Forest Service  appropriations available for such work, with subsequent reimbursement  from the cooperator, in accordance with established written agreements.  Forest Service officers shall issue written bills for collection for  cooperator reimbursement payments within the same fiscal year as Forest  Service expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bonding. Each written agreement involving a non-Government  cooperator's total contribution of $25,000 or more to the Forest Service  on a reimbursable basis, must include a provision requiring a payment  bond to guarantee the cooperator's reimbursement payment. Acceptable  security for a payment bond includes Department of the Treasury approved  corporate sureties, Federal Government obligations, and irrevocable  letters of credit. For the purposes of this section, a non-Government  cooperator is an entity that is not a member, division, or affiliate of  a Federal, State, local government, a federally recognized Indian Tribe  (as defined by the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994  [25 U.S.C. 479a]), or other organizations funding a Forest Service  agreement with pass through funding from an entity that is a member,  division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, or  federally recognized Indian Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Avoiding conflict of interest. Forest Service officers shall  avoid acceptance of contributions from cooperators when such  contributions would reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Forest  Service to carry out its responsibilities and duties. Forest Service  officers shall be guided by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. parts 201-209, 5  CFR part 2635, and applicable Department of Agriculture regulations, in  determining if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest  exists in a proposed cooperative effort. Forest Service ethics officials  or the designated Department of Agriculture ethics official should be  consulted on conflict of interest issues.
