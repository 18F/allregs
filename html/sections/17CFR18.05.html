You are a grain processor, so you use wheat futures to offset the price risk incidental to your cash purchases of wheat.</p><p class="depth0">Offsetting Cash or Spot Market Output Price Risk</p><p class="depth0">Using derivative markets for commodities that are direct outputs or sales of your business so as to offset price risk associated with your sale of these outputs.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You are a gasoline refiner, so you use gasoline futures to offset price risk associated with your production of gasoline.</p><p class="depth0">Offsetting Other Cash or Spot Market Price Risks (Cross Price Risk)</p><p class="depth0">Using derivative markets for a commodity that is not a direct input or output of your business, but which has significant price correlations with the direct inputs or outputs of your business.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You manufacture ethanol which is used as an additive in and competitor for gasoline as a combustive fuel. While you neither directly consume nor produce gasoline, you may find that the price you receive for your ethanol product is highly correlated with the price of gasoline, and therefore you reduce ethanol price risk by using gasoline futures contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Other Physical Risk Management Strategies</p><p class="depth0">Managing other price risks incidental to the operation of your business or physical assets through the use of commodity derivative markets.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You are a manufacturer with significant international sales, so you use foreign currency futures to offset risks associated with changes in the competitiveness of your exports and therefore the value of your physical assets such as production plants, land, machinery, etc.</p><p class="depth0">Client Futures/Options on Futures Trading</p><p class="depth0">Fulfilling customer/client desire for portfolio diversification or exposure to various asset classes through your activity as a Commodity Pool Operator, Commodity Trading Advisor, or other similar role.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You collect funds and execute trading strategies through the use of futures/options

on futures markets at the expressed intent and for the sole benefit of clients.</p><p class="depth0">Managing Client Swaps Exposure</p><p class="depth0">Reducing risk stemming from holding or executing swaps contracts on behalf of clients or customers through the use of futures/options on futures markets.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You sell crude oil swaps to a client and agree to accept the risk inherent in the index price. You offset this risk through purchases of crude oil futures, in effect transferring price risk from the client to another market participant.</p><p class="depth0">Making Markets/Providing Liquidity</p><p class="depth0">Engaging in derivatives transactions to assume risk and help transfer ownership of derivative positions from one market participant to another, realizing the bid-ask spread as the return.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You accept risk by buying and selling futures/options on futures contracts so that other traders can move into and out of positions when they wish. You then find other traders willing to take the other side of those transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Arbitrage</p><p class="depth0">Using derivative markets as part of a strategy designed to realize risk-free profit from pricing anomalies.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You realize that the wheat futures contract is trading at a discount (even after considering storage, transport, etc.) relative to the wheat cash price, and therefore find it profitable to purchase the wheat futures contract, take delivery, and then resell the wheat in the cash market for a risk-free profit.</p><p class="depth0">Establishing Price Exposure</p><p class="depth0">Using derivative markets as a way to express your belief in the future movement of market prices. This strategy does not involve offsetting risks incidental to your business, but instead involves directional trading.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You conduct research and believe that crude oil prices are due to rise, so you take long futures positions in crude oil to profit from your predictions.</p><p class="depth0">Financial Asset Management</p><p class="depth0">Using derivatives to diversify, rebalance, or otherwise allocate financial assets so that risks to the value of the investment portfolio are reduced. This strategy is used by entities such as pension funds and endowments to manage overall risk to their financial portfolios.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You hold Treasury bonds as a component of your investment portfolio, and use futures contracts to reduce overall portfolio risk that would result from falling bond prices.</p><p class="depth0">Managing Proprietary Swaps Exposure</p><p class="depth0">Reducing risk stemming from your proprietary holding or execution of swaps contracts through the use of futures/options on futures markets.</p><p class="depth0">E.g. You trade interest rate swaps as part of your business or investment strategy, and offset some of the risk inherent in those swaps through your use of Eurodollar futures markets.</p><p class="depth0">Other: Specify</p><p class="depth0">List and explain your business purpose if the above categories do not adequately describe the reason you trade in a particular commodity derivative market.
