The notice of appeal sent to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals shall certify that a copy has been sent to the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the appellant is an Indian or Indian tribe not represented by counsel, the official with whom the appeal is filed (i.e., official making the decision being appealed) shall, in the manner prescribed in this section, personally or by mail serve a copy of all appeal documents on the official who will decide the appeal and on each interested party known to the official making such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service of any document under this part shall be by personal delivery or by mail to the record address as specified in Sec. 2.14.
