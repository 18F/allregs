                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency must pay the amounts that were deferred because they  were in excess of the aggregate limitation (as described in Sec.  530.203) as a lump-sum payment at the beginning of the following  calendar year, except as otherwise provided in this section. This  payment is part of the employee's aggregate compensation for the new  calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section causes  an employee's estimated aggregate compensation to exceed the aggregate  limitation in the current calendar year, an agency must consider only  the employee's basic pay that is expected to be paid in the current year  in determining the extent to which the lump-sum payment may be paid. An  agency must defer all other payments, as provided in Sec. 530.203, in  order to pay as much of the lump-sum excess amount as possible. Any  payments deferred under this paragraph, including any portion of the  lump-sum excess amount that was not payable, are payable at the  beginning of the next calendar year, as provided in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an employee transfers to another agency, the gaining agency  is responsible for making any lump-sum payment required by paragraph (a)  of this section. The previous employing agency must provide the gaining  agency with documentation regarding the employee's excess amount, as  provided   in Sec. 530.205. The previous employing agency must provide a fund  transfer equal to the total cost of the lump-sum payment to the gaining  agency through the Department of the Treasury's Intra-Governmental  Payment and Collection System. If an employee leaves Federal service,  the employing agency is responsible for making the lump-sum payment to  the employee as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An agency must pay any excess amount regardless of the calendar  year limitation under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an employee dies, the employing agency must pay the entire  excess amount as part of the settlement of accounts, in accordance with  5 U.S.C. 5582.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an employee separates from Federal service, the employing  agency must pay the entire excess amount following a 30-day break in  service. If the individual is reemployed in the Federal service within  the same calendar year as the separation, any previous payment of an  excess amount must be considered part of that year's aggregate  compensation for the purpose of applying the aggregate limitation for  the remainder of the calendar year.</p>
