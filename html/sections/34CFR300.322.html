(1) The notice required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Indicate the purpose, time, and location of the meeting and who will be in attendance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inform the parents of the provisions in Sec. 300.321(a)(6) and (c) (relating to the participation of other individuals on the IEP Team who have knowledge or special expertise about the child), and Sec. 300.321(f) (relating to the participation of the Part C service coordinator or other representatives of the Part C system at the initial IEP Team meeting for a child previously served under Part C of the Act).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a child with a disability beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when the child turns 16, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team, the notice also must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Indicate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals and transition services for the child, in accordance with Sec. 300.320(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That the agency will invite the student; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identify any other agency that will be invited to send a representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other methods to ensure parent participation.

A meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend.
