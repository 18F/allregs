                            <p class="depth0">Carriers and intermediate handlers shall not commingle live animal  shipments with inanimate cargo. All animal holding areas of a terminal  facility of any carrier or intermediate handler wherein live animal  shipments are maintained shall be cleaned and sanitized in a manner  prescribed in Sec. 3.141 of the standards often enough to prevent an  accumulation of debris or excreta, to minimize vermin infestation and to  prevent a disease hazard. An effective program for the control of  insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be  established and maintained for all animal holding areas. Any animal  holding area containing live animals shall be provided with fresh air by  means of windows, doors vents, or air conditioning and may be ventilated  or air circulated by means of fans, blowers, or an air conditioning  system so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.  Auxiliary ventilation, such as exhaust fans and vents or fans or blowers  or air conditioning shall be used for any animal holding area containing  live animals when the air temperature within such animal holding area is  23.9 [deg]C. (75.[deg]F.) or higher. The air temperature around any live  animal in any animal holding area shall not be allowed to fall below 7.2  [deg]C. (45 [deg]F.) nor be allowed to exceed 29.5 [deg]C. (85 [deg]F.)  at any time: Provided, however, That no live animal shall be subjected  to surrounding air temperatures which exceed 23.9 [deg]C. (75 [deg]F.)  for more than 4 hours at any time. To ascertain compliance with the  provisions of this paragraph, the air temperature around any live animal  shall be measured and read outside the primary enclosure which contains  such animal at a distance not to exceed .91 meters (3 feet) from any one  of the external walls of the primary enclosure and on a level parallel  to the bottom of such primary enclosure at a point which approximates  half the distance between the top and bottom of such primary enclosure.
