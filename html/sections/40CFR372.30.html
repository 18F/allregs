                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each toxic chemical known by the owner or operator to be manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28 at its covered facility described in Sec. 372.22 for a calendar year, the owner or operator must submit to EPA and to the State in which the facility is located a completed EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1), EPA Form A (EPA Form 9350-2), and, for the dioxin and dioxin-like compounds category, EPA Form R Schedule 1 (EPA Form 9350-3) in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part. If the covered facility is located in Indian country, the facility shall submit (to the extent applicable) a completed EPA Form R, Form A, and Form R Schedule 1 as described above to EPA and to the official designated

by the Tribal Chairperson or equivalent elected official of the relevant Indian Tribe, instead of to the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> The owner or operator of a covered facility is required to report as described in paragraph (a) of this section on a toxic chemical that the owner or operator knows is present as a component of a mixture or trade name product which the owner or operator receives from another person, if that chemical is imported, processed, or otherwise used by the owner or operator in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28 at the facility as part of that mixture or trade name product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of a covered facility is required to report as described in paragraph (a) of this section on a toxic chemical that the owner or operator knows is present as a component of a mixture or trade name product which the owner or operator receives from another person, if that chemical is imported, processed, or otherwise used by the owner or operator in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28 at the facility as part of that mixture or trade name product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator knows that a toxic chemical is present as a component of a mixture or trade name product (i) if the owner or operator knows or has been told the chemical identity or Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number of the chemical and the identity or Number corresponds to an identity or Number in Sec. 372.65, or (ii) if the owner or operator has been told by the supplier of the mixture or trade name product that the mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical subject to section 313 of the Act or this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine whether a toxic chemical which is a component of a mixture or trade name product has been imported, processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28 at the facility, the owner or operator shall consider only the portion of the mixture or trade name product that consists of the toxic chemical and that is imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility, together with any other amounts of the same toxic chemical that the owner or operator manufactures, imports, processes, or otherwise uses at the facility as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical and the specific concentration at which it is present in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall determine the weight of the chemical imported, processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name product at the facility and shall combine that with the weight of the toxic chemical manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the facility other than as part of the mixture or trade name product. After combining these amounts, if the owner or operator determines that the toxic chemical was manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28, the owner or operator shall report the specific chemical identity and all releases of the toxic chemical on EPA Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical and does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, but has been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that the toxic chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at the upper bound concentration, shall determine whether the chemical has been manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in excess of an applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical, does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, has not been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, and has not otherwise developed information on the composition of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, then the owner or operator is not required to factor that chemical in that mixture or trade name product into threshold and release calculations for that chemical.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical and knows the specific concentration at which it is present in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall determine the weight of the chemical imported, processed, or otherwise used

as part of the mixture or trade name product at the facility. Since the owner or operator does not know the specific identity of the toxic chemical, the owner or operator shall make the threshold determination only for the weight of the toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product. If the owner or operator determines that the toxic chemical was imported, processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name product in excess of an applicable threshold in Sec. 372.25, Sec. 372.27, or Sec. 372.28, the owner or operator shall report the generic chemical name of the toxic chemical, or a trade name if the generic chemical name is not known, and all releases of the toxic chemical on EPA Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical, and does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, but has been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that the toxic chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at the upper bound concentration, shall determine whether the chemical has been imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in excess of an applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical, does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, including information they have themselves developed, and has not been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator is not required to report with respect to that toxic chemical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A covered facility may consist of more than one establishment. The owner or operator of such a facility at which a toxic chemical was manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold may submit a separate Form R for each establishment or for each group of establishments within the facility to report the activities involving the toxic chemical at each establishment or group of establishments, provided that activities involving that toxic chemical at all the establishments within the covered facility are reported. If each establishment or group of establishments files separate reports then for all other chemicals subject to reporting at that facility they must also submit separate reports. However, an establishment or group of establishments does not have to submit a report for a chemical that is not manufactured (including imported), processed, otherwise used, or released at that establishment or group of establishments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each report under this section for activities involving a toxic chemical that occurred during a calendar year at a covered facility must be submitted on or before July 1 of the next year. The first such report for calendar year 1987 activities must be submitted on or before July 1, 1988.
