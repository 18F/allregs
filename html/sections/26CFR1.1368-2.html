                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Accumulated adjustments account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The accumulated  adjustments account is an account of the S corporation and is not  apportioned among shareholders. The AAA is relevant for all taxable  years beginning on or after January 1, 1983, for which the corporation  is an S corporation. On the first day of the first year for which the  corporation is an S corporation, the balance of the AAA is zero. The AAA  is increased in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  and is decreased in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section. For the adjustments to the AAA in the case of redemptions,  liquidations, reorganizations, and corporate separations, see paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Increases to the AAA. The AAA is increased for the taxable year  of the corporation by the sum of the following items with respect to the  corporation for the taxable year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The items of income described in section 1366(a)(1)(A) other  than income that is exempt from tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any nonseparately computed income determined under section  1366(a)(1)(B); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The excess of the deductions for depletion over the basis of  property subject to depletion unless the property is an oil or gas  property the basis of which has been allocated to shareholders under  section 613A(c)(11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decreases to the AAA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The AAA is decreased for  the taxable year of the corporation by the sum of the following items  with respect to the corporation for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any expense of the corporation not deductible in computing its  taxable income and not properly chargeable to a capital account, other  than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal taxes attributable to any taxable year in which the  corporation was a C corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expenses related to income that is exempt from tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The sum of the shareholders' deductions for depletion for any  oil or gas   property held by the corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extent of allowable reduction. The AAA may be decreased under  paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section below zero. The AAA is decreased by  noncapital, nondeductible expenses under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this  section even though a portion of the noncapital, nondeductible expenses  is not taken into account by a shareholder under Sec. 1.1367-1(g)  (relating to the elective ordering rule). The AAA is also decreased by  the entire amount of any loss or deduction even though a portion of the  loss or deduction is not taken into account by a shareholder under  section 1366(d)(1) or is otherwise not currently deductible under the  Internal Revenue Code. However, in any subsequent taxable year in which  the loss, deduction, or noncapital, nondeductible expense is treated as  incurred by the corporation with respect to the shareholder under  section 1366(d)(2) or Sec. 1.1367-1(g) (or in which the loss or  deduction is otherwise allowed to the shareholder), no further  adjustment is made to the AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Decrease to the AAA for distributions. The AAA is decreased  (but not below zero) by any portion of a distribution to which section  1368 (b) or (c)(1) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ordering rules for the AAA for taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1997. For any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1997,  the adjustments to the AAA are made in the following order--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The AAA is increased under paragraph (a)(2) of this section  before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the  taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AAA is decreased under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section  before it is decreased under paragraph (a)(3) (iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The AAA is decreased (but not below zero) by any portion of an  ordinary distribution to which section 1368 (b) or (c)(1) applies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The AAA is adjusted (whether negative or positive) for  redemption distributions under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ordering rules for the AAA for taxable years beginning on or  after August 18, 1998. For any taxable year of the S corporation  beginning on or after August 18, 1998, the adjustments to the AAA are  made in the following order--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section for the  taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii))</em> before it is decreased under paragraph  (a)(3)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The AAA is decreased (but not below zero) by any portion of an  ordinary distribution to which section 1368(b) or (c)(1) applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The AAA is decreased by any net negative adjustment (as defined  in section 1368(e)(1)(C)(ii)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The AAA is adjusted (whether negative or positive) for  redemption distributions under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Distributions in excess of the AAA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A portion of  the AAA (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is allocated  to each of the distributions made for the taxable year if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An S corporation makes more than one distribution of property  with respect to its stock during the taxable year of the corporation  (including an S short year as defined under section 1362(e)(1)(A));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AAA has a positive balance at the close of the year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The sum of the distributions made during the corporation's  taxable year exceeds the balance of the AAA at the close of the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>. See paragraph (d)(1) of  this section for rules relating to the adjustments to the AAA for  redemptions and distributions in the year of a redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distribution of money and loss property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  amount of the AAA allocated to a distribution under this section must be  further allocated (under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) if the  distribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consists of property the adjusted basis of which exceeds its  fair market value on the date of the distribution and money;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is a distribution to which Sec. 1.1368-1(d)(1) applies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceeds the amount of the corporation's AAA properly allocable  to that distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocating the AAA to loss property. The amount of the AAA  allocated to the property other than money is equal to the amount of the  AAA allocated to the distribution multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the fair market value of the property other than  money on the date of distribution and the denominator of which is the  amount of the distribution. The amount of the AAA allocated to the money  is equal to the amount of the AAA allocated to the distribution reduced  by the amount of the AAA allocated to the property other than money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Adjustment in the case of redemptions, liquidations,  reorganizations, and divisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Redemptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In  the case of a redemption distribution by an S corporation that is  treated as an exchange under section 302(a) or section 303(a) (a  redemption distribution), the AAA of the corporation is adjusted in an  amount equal to the ratable share of the corporation's AAA (whether  negative or positive) attributable to the redeemed stock as of the date  of the redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for years in which a corporation makes both  ordinary and redemption distributions. In any year in which a  corporation makes one or more distributions to which section 1368(a)  applies (ordinary distributions) and makes one or more redemption  distributions, the AAA of the corporation is adjusted first for any  ordinary distributions and then for any redemption distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustments to earnings and profits. Earnings and profits are  adjusted under section 312 independently of any adjustments made to the  AAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liquidations and reorganizations. An S corporation acquiring the  assets of another S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a)  applies will succeed to and merge its AAA (whether positive or negative)  with the AAA (whether positive or negative) of the distributor or  transferor S corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or  transfer. Thus, the AAA of the acquiring corporation after the  transaction is the sum of the AAAs of the corporations prior to the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corporate separations to which section 368(a)(l)(D) applies. If  an S corporation with accumulated earnings and profits transfers a part  of its assets constituting an active trade or business to another  corporation in a transaction to which section 368(a)(l)(D) applies, and  immediately thereafter the stock and securities of the controlled  corporation are distributed in a distribution or exchange to which  section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355)  applies, the AAA of the distributing corporation immediately before the  transaction is allocated between the distributing corporation and the  controlled corporation in a manner similar to the manner in which the  earnings and profits of the distributing corporation are allocated under  section 312 (h). See Sec. 1.312-10(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to terminate year under section 1377(a)(2) or Sec.  1.1368-1(g)(2). If an election is made under section 1377(a)(2) (to  terminate the year in the case of termination of a shareholder's  interest) or Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of  a qualifying disposition), this section applies as if the taxable year  consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the  close of the day on which the shareholder terminated his or her interest  in the corporation or makes a substantial disposition of stock,  whichever the case may be.
