                            <p class="depth0">Review of the application will usually include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nondiscrimination. Boundaries for the proposed service area must  not be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded  because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or  national origin. This does not preclude construction of the project in  phases as noted in Sec. 1780.11 as long as it is not done in a  discriminatory manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant determination. Grants will be determined by the processing  office in accordance with the following provisions and will not result  in EDU costs below similar system user cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum grant. Grants may not exceed the percentages in  Sec. 1780.10(c) of the eligible RUS project development costs listed in  Sec. 1780.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Debt service. Applicants will be considered for grant assistance  when the debt service portion of the average annual EDU cost, for users  in the applicant's service area, exceeds the following percentages of  median household income:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 0.5 percent when the median household income of the service area  is equal to or below 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median income.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 1.0 percent when the median household income of the service  area exceeds the 0.5 percent requirement but   is not more than 100 percent the statewide nonmetropolitan household  income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Similar system cost. If the grant determined in paragraph (b)(2)  of this section results in an annual EDU cost that is not comparable  with similar systems, the Agency will determine a grant amount based on  achieving EDU costs that are not below similar system user costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wholesale service. When an applicant provides wholesale sales or  services on a contract basis to another system or entity, similar  wholesale system cost will be used in determining the amount of grant  needed to achieve a reasonable wholesale user cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subsidized cost. When annual cost to the applicant for delivery  of service is subsidized by either the state, commonwealth, or  territory, and uniform flat user charges regardless of usage are imposed  for similar classes of service throughout the service area, the Agency  may proceed with a grant in an amount necessary to reduce such delivery  cost to a reasonable level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> User charges. The user charges should be reasonable and produce  enough revenue to provide for all costs of the facility after the  project is complete. The planned revenue should be sufficient to provide  for all debt service, debt reserve, operation and maintenance, and, if  appropriate, additional revenue for facility replacement of short-lived  assets without building a substantial surplus. Ordinarily, the total  debt service reserve will be equal to one average annual loan  installment which will accumulate at the rate of one-tenth of the total  each year.
