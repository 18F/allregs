Recheck after tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Introduce span gases and set instrument gains. In order to avoid errors, span and calibrate at the same flow rates used to analyze the test sample. Span gases should have concentrations equal to 75 to 100 percent of full scale. If gain has shifted significantly on the analyzers, check the calibrations.

If difference is greater than 2 percent of full scale, repeat the procedure in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For CH3OH (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce test samples into the gas chromatograph and measure the concentration. This concentration is CMS in the calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For HCHO (methanol-fueled vehicles), introduce test samples into the high pressure liquid chromatograph and measure the concentration of formaldehyde as a dinitropheylhydrazine derivative in acetonitrile. This concentration is CFS in the calculations.
