                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability. Either the Director or any respondent may, at any  time during the administrative civil penalty process described in this  subpart, propose an offer of settlement. The amount accepted in  settlement may be less than the civil penalty that might be imposed in  the event of a formal determination of violation. Upon mutual agreement  by the Director and a respondent on the terms of a settlement, the  Director shall issue an Order of Settlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to issuance of Penalty Notice. Any offer of  settlement made by a respondent prior to the issuance of a Penalty  Notice shall be submitted, in writing, to the Chief of Civil Penalties,  Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500  Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After issuance of Penalty Notice. Any offer of settlement made  by a respondent after issuance of a Penalty Notice shall state that it  is made pursuant to this section; shall recite or incorporate as a part  of the offer the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(6) of this  section; shall be signed by the respondent making the offer, and not  only by his or her representative; and shall be submitted to the Chief  Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extensions of time. The submission of any settlement offer does  not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any  portion of the administrative civil penalty process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings. Any  respondent (or potential respondent in the case of a pending Prepenalty  Notice) may request, in writing, that the Director withhold issuance of  any such notice, or grant an extension of time to respond to any such  Notice, for a period not to exceed 60 days for the exclusive purpose of  effecting settlement. The Director may grant any such request, in  writing, under terms and conditions within his or her discretion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After issuance of Order Instituting Proceedings. Upon mutual  agreement of the Director and a respondent, the Administrative Law Judge  may grant an extension of time, for a period not to exceed 60 days, for  the exclusive purpose of effecting settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Views of Administrative Law Judge. Where an Administrative Law  Judge is assigned to a proceeding, the Director or the respondent may  request that the Administrative Law Judge express his or her views  regarding the appropriateness of the offer of settlement. A request for  the Administrative Law Judge to express his or her views on an offer of  settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement conference  constitutes a waiver by the party making the request of any right to  claim bias or prejudgment by the Administrative Law Judge based on the  views expressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Waivers. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By submitting an offer of settlement, a respondent  making the offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> All hearings pursuant to section 16 of the Trading with the  Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 16);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Proceedings before, and a decision by, an Administrative Law  Judge;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> All post-hearing procedures; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Judicial review by any court.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By submitting an offer of settlement the respondent further  waives:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such provisions of this subpart or other requirements of law as  may be construed to prevent any member of the Director's staff, or  members of the Office of Chief Counsel or other counsel assigned by the  General Counsel, from participating in or advising the Director as to  any order, opinion, finding of fact, or conclusion of law to be entered  pursuant to the offer; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the Director based on  the consideration of or discussions concerning settlement of all or any  part of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the Director rejects the offer of settlement, the respondent  shall be so notified in writing and the offer of settlement shall be  deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall not constitute a part of the  record in any proceeding against the respondent making the offer,  provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not  affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of  this section with respect to any discussions concerning the rejected  offer of settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No settlement offer or proposal, or any subsequent negotiation  or resolution, is admissible as evidence in any administrative  proceeding initiated by the Director.</p>
