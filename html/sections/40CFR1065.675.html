Make this estimate where the  humidified NO span gas was introduced in Sec.  1065.370(e)(6). When  estimating the maximum expected mole fraction of water, consider the  maximum expected water content in combustion air, fuel combustion  products, and dilution air (if applicable). If you introduced the  humidified NO span gas into the sample system upstream of a sample dryer  during the verification test, you need not estimate the maximum expected  mole fraction of water and you must set xH2Oexp equal to  xH2Omeas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Estimate the maximum expected CO2 concentration  during emission testing, xCO2exp. Make this estimate at the  sample system location where the blended NO and CO2 span  gases are introduced according to Sec.  1065.370(d)(10).
