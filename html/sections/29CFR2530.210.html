Except as otherwise provided in section  202(b) of the Act and section 410(a)(5) of the Code, all years of  participation under the plan must be taken into account for purposes of  section 204 of the Act and section 411(b) of the Code (relating to  benefit accrual). Section 204(b) of the Act and section 411(b) of the  Code require only that periods of actual participation in the plan  (e.g., covered service) be taken into account for purposes of benefit  accrual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)(D)</em> of the Act and sections 410(a)(5)(D) and 411(a)(6)(D) of  the Code (rule of parity) to such plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiple employer plans--(1) Eligibility to participate and  vesting. A multiple employer plan shall be treated as if all maintaining  employers constitute a single employer so long as an employee is  employed in either covered service or contiguous noncovered service.  Accordingly, except as referred to in paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and provided in  paragraph (f) of this section, in determining an employee's service for  eligibility to participate and vesting purposes, all covered service  with an employer or employers maintaining the plan and all contiguous  noncovered service with an employer or employers maintaining the plan  shall be taken into account. Thus, for example, if an employee in  service covered under a multiple employer plan leaves covered service  with one employer maintaining the plan and is employed immediately  thereafter in covered service with another employer maintaining the  plan, the plan is required to credit all hours of service with both  employers for purposes of participation and vesting. If an employee  moves from contiguous noncovered to covered service, or from covered  service to contiguous noncovered service, with the same employer, the  plan is required to credit all hours of service with such employer for  purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and provided in paragraph (f) of this section, in  determining a participant's service for benefit accrual purposes, all  covered service with an employer or employers maintaining the plan shall  be taken into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section, the term  ``multiple employer plan'' shall mean a multiemployer plan as defined in  section 3(37) of the Act and section 414(f) of the Code or a multiple  employer plan within the meaning of sections 413 (b) and (c) of the   Code and the regulations issued thereunder. Notwithstanding the  preceding sentence, a plan maintained solely by members of the same  controlled group of corporations within the meaning of paragraph (d) of  this section or by trades or businesses which are under the common  control of one person or group of persons within the meaning of  paragraph (e) of this section shall not be deemed to be a multiple  employer plan for purposes of this section, and such plan is required to  apply the rules under this section which are applicable to controlled  groups of corporations or commonly controlled trades or businesses  respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``covered service''  shall mean service with an employer or employers maintaining the plan  within a job classification or class of employees covered under the  plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this section the term ``noncovered service''  shall mean service with an employer or employers maintaining the plan  which is not covered service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> General. For purposes of this section noncovered service  shall be deemed ``contiguous'' if (1) the noncovered service precedes or  follows covered service and (2) no quit, discharge, or retirement occurs  between such covered service and noncovered service.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the case  of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning of paragraph  (d) of this section or trades or businesses which are under the common  control of one person or group of persons within the meaning of  paragraph (e) of this section, any transfer of an employee from one  member of the controlled group to another member or from one trade or  business under common control to another trade or business under the  common control of the same person or group of persons shall result in  the period of noncovered service which immediately precedes or follows  such transfer being deemed ``noncontiguous'' for purposes of paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth5">Diagram No. 1.

Covered service is  represented by the shaded segments of the diagram. After completing 1  year of noncovered service, employee A immediately enters covered  service with X and completes 4 years of covered service. For purposes of  eligibility to participate and vesting, the plan is required to credit  employee A with 5 years of service with employer X because his period of  service with X includes a period of covered service and a period of  contiguous noncovered service. On the other hand, employee B,  immediately after completing 2 years of noncovered service with X,  enters covered service with Y. Because B quit employment with X, his  period of noncovered service with X is not contiguous and, therefore, is  not required to be taken into account. In the case of employee C, the  plan is required to take into account all service with employers X and Y  because employee C is employed in covered service with both employers.</p><p class="depth5">Diagram No. 2.

Covered service is  represented by the shaded segments of the diagram. Employee E completed  3 years of service with employer X in covered service and then  immediately entered noncovered service with X. Because E's noncovered  service is contiguous, the plan is required to take into account all  service with X for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting  under the multiple employer plan. Employee F does not continue to  receive credit; F quit the employment of Y and entered noncovered  service with X.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Controlled groups of corporations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to a plan  maintained by one or more members of a controlled group of corporations  (within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Code, determined without  regard to sections 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C), all employees of such  corporations shall be treated as employed by a single employer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and provided in paragraph (f) of this section, in  determining a participant's service for benefit accrual purposes, all  service during periods of participation covered under the plan with any  employer which is a member of the controlled group of corporations shall  be taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Commonly controlled trades or businesses. With respect to a plan  maintained only by one or more trades or businesses (whether or not  incorporated) which are under common control within the meaning of  section 414(c) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, all  employees of such trades or businesses shall be treated as employed by a  single employer. Accordingly, except as referred to in paragraph (a)(1)  and provided in paragraph (f) of this section, in determining an  employee's service for eligibility to participate and vesting purposes,  all service with any employer which is under common control shall be  taken into account. Except as referred to in paragraph (a)(2) and  provided in paragraph (f) of this section, in determining a  participant's service for benefit accrual purposes, all service during  periods of participation covered under the plan with any employer which  is under common control shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth2">Diagram No. 3.

The dotted segments of the  diagram represent plan coverage under plans separately maintained by X  and Y. Neither employer maintains any other plans. Because A1, B1, C1,  and D1 have their service with X and Y treated as if X and Y were a  single employer, the plans are required to take into account all service  with X and Y for eligibility to participate and vesting purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special break in service rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to service which  may be disregarded under the statutory provisions referred to in  paragraph (a) of this section, a multiple employer plan may disregard  noncontiguous non- covered service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan maintained solely by one or more members  of a controlled group of corporations or one or more trades or  businesses which are under common control, if one of the maintaining  employers is also a participating employer in a multiple employer plan  which includes other employers which are not members of the controlled  group or commonly controlled trades or businesses, service with such  other employer maintaining the multiple employer plan may be disregarded  by the controlled group or commonly controlled plan.</p><p class="depth3">Diagram No. 4. (Break in Service Rules.)</p><p class="depth3">[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth3">Diagram No. 4 illustrates the break in service rules of paragraph  (f) of this section. Assume for purposes of diagram No. 4 that employer  Z is controlled by employer X but employer Y's only relation to X and Z  is that X, Y, and Z are required to contribute to a multiple employer  plan. The multiple employer plan, represented by the shaded segments of  the diagram, provides for 100 percent vesting after 10 years. X, Y, and  Z maintain no other plans.</p><p class="depth3">Employee G completed 5 years of covered service with employer Y, and  then moved to noncovered service with employer Z. G's noncovered service  is noncontiguous (see employee F in diagram No. 2 above), and such  service may be disregarded for purposes of the multiple employer plan  under the rule in paragraph (f)(1).</p><p class="depth3">Employee H completed 2 years of covered service with employer Y and  then entered covered service with employer X for 1 year. The multiple  employer plan is required to credit H with 3 years of service. H then  entered noncovered service with employer Z. H's noncovered service is  noncontiguous (see employee F in diagram No. 2 above), and such service  may be disregarded for purposes of the multiple employer plan under the  rule in paragraph (f)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rule of parity. For purposes of sections 202(b)(4) and  203(b)(3)(D) of the Act and sections 410(a)(5)(D) and 411(a)(6)(D) of  the Code, in the case of an employee who is a nonvested participant in  employer-derived accrued benefits at the time he incurs a 1-year break  in service, years of service completed by such employee before such  break are not required to be taken into account if at such time he  incurs consecutive 1-year breaks in service which equal or exceed the  aggregate number of years of service before such breaks. This is so even  though the period of noncontiguous noncovered service with an employer  or employers maintaining the plan may subsequently be deemed contiguous  as the result of the employee entering covered service with the same  employer maintaining the plan and, consequently, such plan may be  required to credit such service.</p><p class="depth2">Diagram No. 5. (Rule of parity)</p><p class="depth2">[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth2">Assume for purposes of diagram No. 5 that X and Y are both employers  who are required to contribute to a multiple employer plan which  contains a provision applying the rule of parity. Covered service is  represented by the shaded segments of the diagram. The plan has 100%  vesting after 10 years. X and Y maintain no other plan.</p><p class="depth2">The multiple employer plan credited employee I with 4 years of  service with X when he quit employment with X and entered noncovered  service with Y. As a result of 4 years of noncontiguous noncovered  service with Y, employee I incurred 4 consecutive 1-year breaks in  service, so that the multiple employer plan may disregard his prior  service (i.e., the 4 years of service with X).</p><p class="depth2">When employee I entered covered service with Y (as a ``new  employee''), his 4 years of noncontiguous service with Y became  contiguous for purposes of the multiple employer plan. Consequently,  after 1 year of covered service with Y, the plan is required to credit  employee I with 5 years of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Example. Under section 203(b)(1)(C) of the Act and section  411(a)(4)(C) of the Code, service with an employer prior to such  employer's adoption of the plan need not be taken into account. The  following example demonstrates that this rule applies even if an  employee is employed in contiguous noncovered service. The example is  applicable to any plan subject to the rules of this section. However,  for purposes of clarity, the example assumes that X and Y are required  to contribute to a multiple employer plan.</p><p class="depth2">Assume that employee D completed 3 years of covered service with  employer Y as of the date X adopts the plan. Immediately after X's  adoption of the plan D left covered service with Y and D entered covered  service with X. His prior covered service with Y is   required to be counted, and D remains a participant.</p><p class="depth2">On the other hand, if D had entered service with X any time prior to  X's adoption of the plan and subsequently was covered by the plan when X  adopted it, his prior service with Y must also be counted, unless such  service may be disregarded under the break in service rules because the  period of service with X before X's adoption of the plan was equal to or  greater than his prior service with Y. For example, if X adopted the  plan three years after D began employment with X, and consequently after  D had incurred 3 consecutive 1-year breaks in service, his prior service  with Y could be disregarded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Comprehensive diagram. (No. 6)</p><p class="depth4">[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth4">Assume for purposes of diagram No. 6 that employer Z is controlled  by employer X within the meaning of paragraph (d) but employer Y's only  relation to X and Z is that X, Y and Z are required to contribute to a  multiple employer plan. The shaded segments represent coverage under the  multiple employer plan which contains a provision applying the rule of  parity. The dotted segment represents a separate plan maintained by Z.  Both plans have 100% vesting after 10 years.</p><p class="depth4">Employee J completed 3 years of service with employer X in covered  service with the multiple employer plan. J then entered non- covered  service with Y and remained with Y for 1 year, and thereby incurred a 1- year break in service under the multiple employer plan. J then entered  covered service with employer Y, thereby causing the noncovered service  with Y to become contiguous. Covered service with X and contiguous  noncovered and covered service with Y must be taken into account for  purposes of the multiple employer plan; accordingly, that plan is  required to credit J with a total of 5 years of service.</p><p class="depth4">J then left service with Y and entered noncovered service (with  respect to the multiple employer plan) with Z. J remained in noncovered  service with Z (with respect to the multiple employer plan) for 5 years  and thereby incurred 5 consecutive 1-year break in service for purposes  of the multiple employer plan. Consequently, the prior service with X  and Y may be disregarded for purposes of the multiple employer plan.</p><p class="depth4">J then entered covered service under the multiple employer plan with  Z and completed 1 year of service. Because the 5 years of noncovered  service with Z is contiguous with the 1 year of covered service, the  multiple employer plan is now required to credit J with 6 years of  service for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting.</p><p class="depth4">For purposes of Z's controlled group plan (i.e., dotted segment),  employee J is entitled to receive credit for 9 years of service. The 3  years of service with X, a member of the controlled group, may not be  disregarded under the rule of parity because J incurred only 2  consecutive 1-year breaks in service while employed with Y. When J  entered service with Z covered under Z's controlled group plan, the 3  years of service with X were still required to be credited by the  controlled group plan. In addition, J must receive credit for the 5  years of service with Z covered under the controlled group plan.  Finally, when J moved to service with Z covered under the multiple  employer plan the controlled group plan was required to credit J with an  additional year of service.</p><p class="depth4">SUBCHAPTER E [RESERVED]</p><p class="depth4">SUBCHAPTER F_FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT</p><p class="depth4">INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974</p>
