Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, an article may be eligible for duty-free treatment under the  ATPA if the article is either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary  country; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A new or different article of commerce which has been grown,  produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. No article shall be eligible for duty-free treatment  under the ATPA by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed  to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere  dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does  not materially alter the characteristics of the article. The principles  and examples set forth in Sec. 10.195(a)(2) of this part shall apply  equally for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
