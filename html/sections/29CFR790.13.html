                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under the provisions of sections 9 and 10 of the Portal Act, an  employer has a defense against liability or punishment in any action or  proceeding brought against him for failure to comply with the minimum  wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, where the  employer pleads and proves that ``the act or omission complained of was  in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on any administrative  regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation'' or ``any  administrative practice or enforcement policy * * * with respect to the  class of employers to which he belonged.'' In order to provide a defense  with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or after May 14, 1947  (the effective date of the Portal Act), the regulation, order, ruling,  approval, interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy  relied upon and conformed with must be that of the ``Administrator of  the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor,'' and a  regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation of the  Administrator may be relied on only if it is in writing. \88\ But where  the acts or omissions complained of occurred before May 14, 1947, the  employer may show that they were in good faith in conformity with and in  reliance on ``any'' (written or nonwritten) administrative   regulation, order, ruling, or interpretation of ``any agency of the  United States,'' or any administrative practice or enforcement policy of  ``any such agency'' with respect to the class of employers to which he  belonged. \89\ In all cases, however, the act or omission complained of  must be both ``in conformity with'' \90\ and ``in reliance on'' \91\ the  administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation,  practice, or enforcement policy, as the case may be, and such  conformance and reliance and such act or omission must be ``in good  faith.'' \92\ The relief from liability or punishment provided by  sections 9 and 10 of the Portal Act is limited by the statute to  employers who both plead and prove all the requirements of the defence.  \93\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\88\ Portal Act, sec. 10; Conference Report, p. 16; statements of  Senator Wiley, explaining the conference agreement to the Senate, 93  Cong.

Rec. 5281).</p><p class="depth0">The requirements of the statute as to pleading and proof emphasize  the continuing recognition by Congress of the remedial nature of the  Fair Labor Standards Act and of the need for safeguarding the protection  which Congress intended it to afford employees. See Sec. 790.2; of.  statements of Senator Wiley, 93 Cong. Rec. 4270; Senator Donnell, 93  Cong. Rec. 4452, and Representative Walter, 93 Cong. Rec. 4388, 4389. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The distinctions mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section,  depending on whether the acts or omissions complained of occurred before  or after May 14, 1947, may be illustrated as follows: Assume that an  employer, on commencing performance of a contract with X Federal Agency  extending from January 1, 1947 to January 1, 1948, received an opinion  from the agency that employees working under the contract were not  covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Assume further that the  employer may be said to have relied in good faith upon this opinion and  therefore did not compensate such employees during the period of the  contract in accordance with the provisions of the Act. After completion  of the contract on January 1, 1948, the employees, who have learned that  they are probably covered by the Act, bring suit against their employer  for unpaid overtime compensation which they claim is due them. If the  court finds that the employees were performing work subject to the Act,  they can recover for the period commencing May 14, 1947, even though the  employer pleads and proves that his failure to pay overtime was in good  faith in conformity with and in reliance on the opinion of X Agency,  because for that period the defense would, under section 10 of the  Portal Act, have to be based upon written administrative regulation,  order, ruling, approval, or interpretation, or an administrative  practice or enforcement policy of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour  Division. The defense would, however, be good for the period from  January 1, 1947 to May 14, 1947, and the employer would be freed from  liability for that period under the provisions of section 9 of the  statute.    Sec. 790.14  ``In conformity with.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The ``good faith'' defense is not available to an employer  unless the acts or omissions complained of were ``in conformity with''  the regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation, administrative  practice or enforcement policy upon which he relied. \94\ This is true  even though the employer erroneously believes he conformed with it and  in good faith relied upon it; actual conformity is necessary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\94\ Statement of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 4451; message of the  President to Congress on approval of the Act, May 14, 1947, 93 Cong.  Rec. 5281. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An example of an employer not acting ``in conformity with'' an  administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, practice, or  enforcement policy is a situation where an employer receives a letter  from the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, stating that if  certain specified circumstances and facts regarding the work performed   by the employer's employees exist, the employees are, in his opinion,  exempt from provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. One of these  hypothetical circumstances upon which the opinion was based does not  exist regarding these employees, but the employer, erroneously assuming  that this circumstance is irrelevant, relies upon the Administrator's  ruling and fails to compensate the employees in accordance with the Act.  Since he did not act ``in conformity'' with that opinion, he has no  defense under section 9 or 10 of the Portal Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> As a further example of the requirement of conformity, reference  is made to the illustration given in Sec. 790.13(b), where an employer,  who had a contract with the X Federal Agency covering the period from  January 1, 1947 to January 1, 1948, received an opinion from the agency  that employees working on the contract were not covered by the Fair  Labor Standards Act. Assume (1) that the X Agency's opinion was confined  solely and exclusively to activities performed under the particular  contract held by the employer with the agency and made no general  statement regarding the status under the Act of the employer's employees  while performing other work; and (2) that the employer, erroneously  believing the reasoning used in the agency's opinion also applied to  other and different work performed by his employees, did not compensate  them for such different work, relying upon that opinion. As previously  pointed out, the opinion from the X Agency, if relied on and conformed  with in good faith by the employer, would form the basis of a ``good  faith'' defense for the period prior to May 14, 1947, insofar as the  work performed by the employees on this particular contract with that  agency was concerned. The opinion would not, however, furnish the  employer a defense regarding any other activities of a different nature  performed by his employees, because it was not an opinion concerning  such activities, and insofar as those activities are concerned, the  employer could not act ``in conformity'' with it.    Sec. 790.15  ``Good faith.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> One of the most important requirements of sections 9 and 10 is  proof by the employer that the act or omission complained of and his  conformance with and reliance upon an administrative regulation, order,  ruling, approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy, were  in good faith. The legislative history of the Portal Act makes it clear  that the employer's ``good faith'' is not to be determined merely from  the actual state of his mind. Statements made in the House and Senate  indicate that ``good faith'' also depends upon an objective test-- whether the employer, in acting or omitting to act as he did, and in  relying upon the regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation,  administrative practice or enforcement policy, acted as a reasonably  prudent man would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.  \95\ ``Good faith'' requires that the employer have honesty of intention  and no knowledge of circumstances which ought to put him upon inquiry.  \96\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\95\ Colloquy between Representatives Reeves and Devitt, 93 Cong.  Rec. 1593; colloquy between Senators Ferguson and Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec.  4451-4452.</p><p class="depth0">\96\ See statement of Senator McGrath, 93 Cong. Rec. 2254-2255;  statement of Representative Keating, 93 Cong. Rec. 4391; statement of  Representative Walter, 93 Cong. Rec. 4389. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Some situations illustrating the application of the principles  stated in paragraph (a) of this section may be mentioned. Assume that a  ruling from the Administrator, stating positively that the Fair Labor  Standards Act does not apply to certain employees, is received by an  employer in response to a request which fully described the duties of  the employees and the circumstances surrounding their employment. It is  clear that the employer's employment of such employees in such duties  and under such circumstances in reliance on the Administrator's ruling,  without compensating them in accordance with the Act, would be in good  faith so long as the ruling remained unrevoked and the employer had no  notice of any facts or circumstances which would lead a reasonably  prudent man to make further inquiry as to   whether the employees came within the Act's provisions. Assume, however,  that the Administrator's ruling was expressly based on certain court  decisions holding that employees so engaged in commerce or in the  production of goods for commerce, and that the employer subsequently  learned from his attorney that a higher court had reversed these  decisions or had cast doubt on their correctness by holding employees  similarly situated to be engaged in an occupation necessary to the  production of goods for interstate commerce. Assume further that the  employer, after learning of this, made no further inquiry but continued  to pay the employees without regard to the requirements of the Act in  reliance on the Administrator's earlier ruling. In such a situation, if  the employees later brought an action against the employer, the court  might determine that they were entitled to the benefits of the Act and  might decide that the employer, after learning of the decision of the  higher court, knew facts which would put a reasonably prudent man upon  inquiry and therefore had not provided his good faith in relying upon  the Administrator's ruling after receiving this advice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In order to illustrate further the test of ``good faith,''  suppose that the X Federal Agency published a general bulletin regarding  manufacturing, which contained the erroneous statement that all foremen  are exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act as employed in a ``bona  fide executive * * * capacity.'' Suppose also that an employer knowing  that the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division is charged with the  duties of administering the Fair Labor Standards Act and of defining the  phrase ``bona fide executive * * * capacity'' in that Act, nevertheless  relied upon the above bulletin without inquiring further and,  inconformity with this advice, failed to compensate his nonexempt  foremen in accordance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act for work subject to that Act, performed before May 14,  1947. If the employer had inquired of the Administrator or had consulted  the Code of Federal Regulations, he would have found that his foremen  were not exempt. In a subsequent action brought by employees under  section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the court may decide that  the employer knew facts which ought to have put him as a reasonable man  upon further inquiry, and, consequently, that he did not rely ``in good  faith'' within the meaning of section 9, upon the bulletin published by  the X Agency. \97\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\97\ See statement of Representative Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 1563, and  colloquy between Senators Connally and Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 4453. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insofar as the period prior to May 14, 1947, is concerned, the  employer may have received an interpretation from an agency which  conflicted with an interpretation of the Administrator of the Wage and  Hour Division of which he was also aware. If the employer chose to reply  upon the interpretation of the other agency, which interpretation worked  to his advantage, considerable weight may well be given to the fact that  the employer ignored the interpretation of the agency charged with the  administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act and chose instead to rely  upon the interpretation of an outside agency. \98\ Under these  circumstances ``the question could properly be considered as to whether  it was a good faith reliance or whether the employer was simply choosing  a course which was most favorable to him.'' \99\   This problem will not arise in regard to any acts or omissions by the  employer occurring on or after May 14, 1947, because section 10 provides  that the employer, insofar as the Fair Labor Standards Act is concerned,  may rely only upon regulations, orders, rulings, approvals,  interpretations, administrative practices and enforcement policies of  the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. \100\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\98\ This view was expressed several times during the debates. See  statements of Representative Keating, 93 Cong. Rec. 1512 and 4391;  colloquy between Representatives Keating and Devitt, 93 Cong. Rec. 1515;  statement of Representative Walter, 93 Cong. Rep. 4389; statement of  Representative MacKinnon, 93 Cong. Rec. 4391; statement of  Representative Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 1563; statement of Senator Cooper,  93 Cong.

Representative  Walter, a member of the Conference Committee, made the following  explanatory statement to the House of Representatives (93 Cong. Rec.  4390): ``The defense of good faith is intended to apply only where an  employer innocently and to his detriment, followed the law as it was  laid down to him by Government agencies, without notice that such  interpretations were claimed to be erroneous or invalid. It is not  intended that this defense shall apply where an employer had knowledge  of conflicting rules and chose to act in accordance with the one most  favorable to him.'' Representative Gwynne made a similar statement (93  Cong. Rec. 1563).</p><p class="depth0">\100\ Statement of Senator Wiley explaining Conference agreement to  the Senate, 93 Cong. Rec. 4270; statement of Representative Walter, 93  Cong. Rec. 4389. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Sec. 790.16  ``In reliance on.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to acting (or omitting to act) in good faith and in  conformity with an administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval,  interpretation, enforcement policy or practice, the employer must also  prove that he actually relied upon it. \101\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\101\ In a colloquy between Senators Thye and Cooper (93 Cong. Rec.  4451), Senator Cooper pointed out that the purpose of section 9 was to  provide a defense for an employer who pleads and proves, among other  things, that his failure to bring himself under the Act ``grew out of  reliance upon'' the ruling of an agency. See also statement of  Representative Keating, 93 Cong. Rec. 1512; colloquy between  Representatives Keating and Devitt, 93 Cong. Rec. 1515; cf. colloquy  between Senators Donnell and Ball, 93 Cong. Rec. 4372. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume, for example, that an employer failed to pay his  employees in accordance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act. After an employee suit has been brought against him,  another employer calls his attention to a letter that had been written  by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, in which the opinion  was expressed that employees of the type employed by the defendant were  exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The  defendant had no previous knowledge of this letter. In the pending  employee suit, the court may decide that the opinion of the  Administrator was erroneous and that the plaintiffs should have been  paid in accordance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act. Since the employer had no knowledge of the  administrator's interpretation at the time of his violations, his  failure to comply with the overtime provisions could not have been ``in  reliance on'' that interpretation; consequently, he has no defense under  section 9 or section 10 of the Portal Act.    Sec. 790.17  ``Administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Administrative regulations, orders, rulings, approvals, and  interpretations are all grouped together in sections 9 and 10, with no  distinction being made in regard to their function under the ``good  faith'' defense. Accordingly, no useful purpose would be served by an  attempt to precisely define and distinguish each term from the others,  especially since some of these terms are often employed interchangeably  as having the same meaning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The terms ``regulation'' and ``order'' are variously used to  connote the great variety of authoritative rules issued pursuant to  statute by an administrative agency, which have the binding effect of  law, unless set aside upon judicial review as arbitrary, capricious, an  abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. \102\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\102\ See Final Report of Attorney General's Committee on  Administrative Procedure, Senate Document No. 8, 77th Cong. 1st sess.

(1941), p. 27. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term ``ruling'' commonly refers to an interpretation made by  an agency ``as a consequence of individual   requests for rulings upon particular questions.'' \104\ Opinion letters  of an agency expressing opinions as to the application of the law to  particular facts presented by specific inquiries fall within this  description. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\104\ Final Report of the Attorney General's Committee, page 27. To  the same effect in 1 Vom Baur, Federal Administrative Law (1942), p.  492. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The term ``approval'' includes the granting of licenses,  permits, certificates or other forms of permission by an agency,  pursuant to statutory authority. \105\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\105\ See section 2(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5  U.S.C.A. sec. 1001. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The terms ``administrative regulation order, ruling, approval,  or interpretation'' connote affirmative action on the part of an agency.  \106\ A failure to act or a failure to reply to an inquiry on the part  of an administrative agency is not a ``regulation, order, ruling,  approval, or interpretation'' within the meaning of sections 9 and 10.  \107\ Thus, suppose that an employer writes a letter to the  Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, setting forth the facts  concerning his business. He goes on to state in his letter that he  believes his employees are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act,  and that unless he hears to the contrary from the Administrator, he will  not pay them in accordance with its provisions. When the employer does  not receive a reply to his letter within what he regards as a reasonable  time, he assumes that the Administrator agrees with his (the employer's)  interpretation of the Act and he acts accordingly. The employer's  reliance under such circumstances is not a reliance upon an  administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation,  within the meaning of sections 9 and 10. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\106\ See Final Report of Attorney General's Committee, p. 27; 1 Vom  Baur, Federal Administrative Law, pp. 486, 492; Conference Report, p.  16; statements of Representative Walter, 93 Cong.

Rec. 2185; President's message of May 14, 1947, on  approval of the Portal-to-Portal Act (93 Cong. Rec. 5281).</p><p class="depth0">\107\ That this is true on and after the effective date of the Act  is clear from the requirement in section 10 that the regulation, order,  ruling, approval or interpretation relied on must be that of the  Administrator in writing. As to section 9, the terms appear to have no  different meaning. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The affirmative action taken by the agency must be one which  actually results in a ``regulation, order, ruling, approval, or  interpretation.'' If for example, the agency declines to express an  opinion as to the application of the law in a particular fact situation,  the agency is refraining from interpreting the law rather than giving an  interpretation. \108\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\108\ See Final Report of Attorney General's Committee on  Administrative Procedure, p. 33. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> An employer does not have a defense under these two sections  unless the regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation, upon  which he relies, is in effect and operation at the time of his reliance.  To the extent that it has been rescinded, modified, or determined by  judicial authority to be invalid, it is no longer a ``regulation, order,  ruling, approval, or interpretation,'' and, consequently, an employer's  subsequent reliance upon it offers him no defense under section 9 and  10. \109\ On the other hand, the last sentence in section 9 and in  section 10 expressly provides that where the employer's good faith  reliance on a regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation  occurs before it is rescinded, modified, or determined by judicial  authority to be invalid, his claim of a ``good faith'' defense for such  earlier period is not defeated by the subsequent rescission or  modification or by the subsequent determination of invalidity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\109\ See House Report, p. 7, and statements of Representative  Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 1491, 1492, 1563. It will be noted that the  provisions of section 12 of the Act, affording relief of employers who  acted in conformity with the invalidated ``area of production''  regulations, would have been unnecessary if reliance could be placed on  a regulation no longer in effect. See statement of Representative  Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 4388, and cf. remarks of Senator McCarran,  discussing the bill before section 12 was added by the conference  committee, 93 Cong. Rec. 2247. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To illustrate these principles, assume that the Administrator of  the Wage and Hour Division, in reply to an inquiry received from a  particular employer, sends him a letter, in which the   opinion is expressed that employees performing a particular type of work  are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The employer relied  upon the Administrator's letter and did not pay his employees who were  engaged in such work, in accordance with the provisions of the Fair  Labor Standards Act. Several months later the Administrator issues a  general statement, published in the Federal Register and given general  distribution, that recent court decisions have persuaded him that the  class of employees referred to above are within the coverage of the Fair  Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, the statement continues, the  Administrator hereby rescinds all his previous interpretations and  rulings to the contrary. The employer who had received the  Administrator's letter, not learning of the Administrator's subsequent  published statement rescinding his contrary interpretations, continued  to rely upon the Administrator's letter after the effective date of the  published statement. Under these circumstances, the employer would, from  the date he received the Administrator's letter to the effective date of  the published statement rescinding the position expressed in the letter,  have a defense under section 9 or 10, assuming he relied upon and  conformed with that letter in good faith. However, in spite of the fact  that this employer did not receive actual notice of the subsequent  published statement, he has no defense for his reliance upon the letter  during the period after the effective date of the public statement,  because the letter, having been rescinded, was no longer an  ``administrative * * * ruling * * * or interpretation'' within the  meaning of sections 9 and 10. \110\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\110\ See Final Report of Attorney General's Gwynne, 93 Cong.

In  such event, section 11 of the Act would permit the court to reduce or  eliminate the employer's liability for liquidated damages in an employee  suit.

An  example is the statement of the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator  of the Wage and Hour Division, dated June 16, 1947, published in 12 FR  3915. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To illustrate this distinction, suppose the Administrator of the  Wage and Hour Division issues a general   statement indicating that in his opinion a certain class of employees  come within a specified exemption from provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act in any workweek when they do not engage in a substantial  amount of nonexempt work. Such a statement is an ``interpretation''  within the meaning of sections 9 and 10 of the Portal Act. Assume that  at the same time, the Administrator states that for purposes of  enforcement, until further notice such an employee will be considered as  engaged in a substantial amount of nonexempt work in any workweek when  he spends in excess of a specified percentage of his time in such  nonexempt work. This latter type of statement announces an  ``administrative practice or enforcement policy'' within the meaning of  sections 9 and 10 of the Portal Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An administrative practice or enforcement policy may, under  certain circumstances be at variance with the agency's current  interpretation of the law. For example, suppose the Administrator  announces that as a result of court decisions he has changed his view as  to coverage of a certain class of employees under the Fair Labor  Standards Act. However, he may at the same time announce that in order  to give affected employers an opportunity to make the adjustments  necessary for compliance with the changed interpretation, the Wage and  Hour Division will not commence to enforce the Act on the basis of the  new interpretation until the expiration of a specified period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the statement of the managers on the part of the House,  accompanying the report of the Conference Committee on the Portal-to- Portal Act, it is indicated (page 16) that under sections 9 and 10 ``an  employer will be relieved from liability, in an action by an employee,  because of reliance in good faith on an administrative practice or  enforcement policy only (1) where such practice or policy was based on  the ground that an act or omission was not a violation of the (Fair  Labor Standards) Act, or (2) where a practice or policy of not enforcing  the Act with respect to acts or omissions led the employer to believe in  good faith that such acts or omissions were not violations of the Act.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The statement explaining the Conference Committee Report goes on  to say, ``However, the employer will be relieved from criminal  proceedings or injunctions brought by the United States, not only in the  cases described in the preceding paragraph, but also where the practice  or policy was such as to lead him in good faith to believe that he would  not be proceeded against by the United States.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The statement explaining the Conference Committee Report gives  the following illustrations of the above rules:</p><p class="depth0">An employer will not be relieved from liability under the Fair Labor  Standards Act of 1938 to his employees (in an action by them) for the  period December 26, 1946, to March 1, 1947, if he is not exempt under  the ``Area of Production'' regulations published in the Federal Register  of December 25, 1946, notwithstanding the press release issued by the  Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor,  in which he stated that he would not enforce the Fair Labor Standards  Act of 1938 on account of acts or omissions occurring prior to March 1,  1947. On the other hand, he will, by reason of the enforcement policy  set forth in such press releases, have a good defense to a criminal  proceeding or injunction brought by the United States based on an act or  omission prior to March 1, 1947.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> It is to be noted that, under the language of sections 9 and 10,  an employer has a defense for good faith reliance on an administrative  practice or an enforcement policy only when such practice or policy is  ``with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged.'' \114\  Thus where an enforcement policy has been announced pertaining to  laundries and linen-supply companies serving industrial or commercial   establishments the operator of an establishment furnishing window- washing service to industrial and commercial concerns, who relied upon  that policy in regard to his employees, has no defense under sections 9  and 10. The enforcement policy upon which he claimed reliance did not  pertain to ``the class of employers to which he belonged.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\114\ This provision, which appeared for the first time in the  conference bill, to which the term ``practice'' was restored after  elimination by the Senate, was apparently designed to meet some of the  objections which led to elimination of the word ``practice'' from the  bill reported by the Senate judiciary Committee. Cf. remarks of Senator  Murray, 93 Cong. Rec. 2238; remarks of Senator Johnston, 93 Cong. Rec.  2373; colloquy between Senators Lucas and Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 2185;  remarks of Senator McGrath, 93 Cong. Rec. 2254-2256. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Administrative practices and enforcement policies, similar to  administrative regulations, orders, rulings, approvals and  interpretations required affirmative action by an administrative agency.  \115\ This should not be construed as meaning that an agency may not  have administrative practices or policies to refrain from taking certain  action as well as practices or policies contemplating positive acts of  some kind. \116\ But before it can be determined that an agency actually  has a practice or policy to refrain from acting, there must be evidence  of its adoption by the agency through some affirmative action  establishing it as the practice or policy of the agency. \117\ Suppose,  for example, that shoe factories in a particular area were not  investigated by Wage and Hour Division inspectors operating in the area.  This fact would not establish the existence of a practice or policy of  the Administrator to treat the employees of such establishments, for  enforcement purposes, as not subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act, in the absence of proof of some affirmative action by the  Administrator adopting such a practice or policy. A failure to inspect  might be due to any one of a number of different reasons. It might, for  instance, be due entirely to the fact that the inspectors' time was  fully occupied in inspections of other industries in the area. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\115\ See Union Stockyards & Transit Co. v.

Baldwin, 289 U.S. 346, 349 (1933),  where the Department of Agriculture announced ``its policy for the  present is to leave the control (of Bang's disease) with the various  States.''

It may  be noted in this connection that examples given by the sponsors of the  legislation, in discussing the terms ``administrative practice or  enforcement policy,'' involved situations in which affirmative action  had been taken by the agency.

Rec.  2185, 2198, 4389-4391. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It was pointed out above that sections 9 and 10 do not offer a  defense to the employer who relies upon a regulation, order, ruling,  approval or interpretation which at the time of his reliance has been  rescinded, modified or determined by judicial authority to be invalid.  The same is true regarding administrative practices and enforcement  policies. \118\ However, a plea of a ``good faith'' defense is not  defeated by the fact that after the employer's reliance, the practice or  policy is rescinded, modified, or declared invalid. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\118\ See Sec. 790.17 (h) and (i), and footnotes 111 and 112. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Sec. 790.19  ``Agency of the United States.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In order to provide a defense under section 9 or section 10 of  the Portal Act, the regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation,  administrative practice or enforcement policy relied upon and conformed  with must be that of an ``agency of the United States.'' Insofar as acts  or omissions occurring on or after May 14, 1947 are concerned, it must  be that of the ``agency of the United States specified in'' section  10(b), which, in the case of the Fair Labor Standards Act, is ``the  Administrator of the Wage and House Division of the Department of  Labor.'' However, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to  May 14, 1947, section 9 of the Act permits the employer to show that he  relied upon and conformed with a regulation, order, ruling, approval,  interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy of ``any  agency of the United States.'' \119\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\119\ The differences in the provisions of the two sections are  explained and illustrated in Sec. 790.13.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Portal Act contains no comprehensive definition of  ``agency'' as used in sections 9 and 10, but an indication of the  meaning intended by Congress may be found in section 10. In that  section, where the ``agency'' whose regulation, order, ruling, approval,  interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy may be  relied on is confined to ``the agency of the United States'' specified  in the section, the Act expressly limits the meaning of the term to the  official or officials actually vested with final authority under the  statutes involved. \120\ Similarly, the definitions of ``agency'' in  other Federal statutes \121\ indicate that the term has customarily been  restricted in its usage by Congress to the persons vested under the  statutes with the real power to act for the Government--those who  actually have the power to act as (rather than merely for) the highest  administrative authority of the Government establishment. \122\  furthermore, it appears from the statement of the managers on the part  of the House accompanying the Conference Committee Report, that the term  ``agency'' as appearing in the Portal Act was employed in this sense. As  there stated (p. 16), the regulations, orders, ruling, approvals,  interpretations, administrative practices and enforcement policies  relied upon and conformed with ``must be those of an `agency' and not of  an individual officer or employee of the agency. Thus, if inspector A  tells the employer that the agency interpretation is that the employer  is not subject to the (Fair Labor Standards) Act, the employer is not  relieved from liability, despite his reliance in good faith on such  interpretations, unless it is in fact the interpretation of the  agency.'' \123\ Similarly, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, in explaining the conference agreement to the Senate, made  the following statement concerning the ``good faith'' defense. ``It will  be noted that the relief from liability must be based on a ruling of a  Federal agency, and not a minor official thereof. I, therefore, feel  that the legitimate interest of labor will be adequately protected under  such a provision, since the agency will exercise due care in the  issuance of any such ruling.'' \124\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\120\ In regard to the Walsh-Healey Act, ``agency'' is defined in  section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act as including, in addition to the  Secretary of Labor, ``any Federal officer utilized by him in the  administration of such Act.'' The legislative history of the Portal-to- Portal Act (93 Cong. Rec. 2239-2240) reveals that this clause was added  because of the language in the Walsh-Healey Act authorizing the  Secretary of Labor to administer the Act ``and to utilize such Federal  officers and employees * * * as he may find necessary in the  administration.''</p><p class="depth0">\121\ Federal Register Act, 44 U.S.C. 304; Federal Reports Act, 5  U.S.C. 139; Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth0">\122\ See Cudahy Packing Co. v.
