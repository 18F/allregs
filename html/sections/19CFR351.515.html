                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Benefit--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of internal transport and  freight charges on export shipments, a benefit exists to the extent that  the charges paid by a firm for transport or freight with respect to  goods destined for export are less than what the firm would have paid if  the goods were destined for domestic consumption. The Secretary will  consider the amount of the benefit to equal the difference in amounts  paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a  benefit does not exist if the Secretary determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any difference in charges is the result of an arm's-length  transaction between the supplier and the user of the transport or  freight service; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The difference in charges is commercially justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time of receipt of benefit. In the case of internal transport  and freight charges for export shipments, the Secretary normally will  consider the benefit as having been received by the firm on the date on  which the firm paid, or in the absence of payment was due to pay, the  charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of benefit to a particular time period. Normally, the  Secretary will allocate (expense) the benefit from internal transport  and freight charges for export shipments to the year in which the  benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p>
