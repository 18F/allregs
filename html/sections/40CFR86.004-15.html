                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Heavy-duty engines eligible for NOX plus NMHC and  particulate averaging, trading and banking programs are described in the  applicable emission standards sections in this subpart. All heavy-duty  engine families which include any engines labeled for use in clean-fuel  vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 88 are not eligible for these   programs. For manufacturers not selecting Options 1 or 2 contained in  Sec. 86.005-10(f), the ABT program requirements contained in  Sec. 86.000-15 apply for 2004 model year Otto-cycle engines, rather than  the provisions contained in this Sec. 86.004-15. Participation in these  programs is voluntary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard  shall obtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the  shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking,  within the averaging set restrictions described in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will  have emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination  thereof. Credits may not be used for averaging or trading to offset  emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in- use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by  recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow subsequent  production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer  elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participation in the NOX plus NMHC and/or particulate  averaging, trading, and banking programs shall be done as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During certification, the manufacturer shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the  averaging, trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are  required for each program and for each pollutant (i.e., NOX  plus NMHC, and particulate).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or  more of these two programs.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the  emission standard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour for  NOX plus NMHC emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake  horsepower-hour for particulate emissions).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the  section concerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NOX plus  NMHC and particulate emission standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Calculate the projected emission credits (positive or  negative) based on quarterly production projections for each  participating family and for each pollutant, using the applicable  equation in paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable factors for  the specific engine family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine and state the source of the needed credits  according to quarterly projected production for engine families  requiring credits for certification.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for  engine families generating credits.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families  within the same averaging set as described in paragraph (d) or (e) of  this section. Credits available for averaging, trading, or banking as  defined in Sec. 86.090-2, may be applied exclusively to a given engine  family, or reserved as defined in Sec. 86.091-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on this information each manufacturer's certification  application must demonstrate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That at the end of model year production, each engine family has  a net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in  paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging,  trading or banking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The source of the credits to be used to comply with the  emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will  be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where  credits are being obtained, each engine family involved must state  specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits  being used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each  engine family involved must state specifically the designated use  (manufacturer/engine family or reserved) of the credits involved. All  such reports shall include all credits involved in averaging, trading or  banking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the model year manufacturers must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that  compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the  model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the end-of-model year reports required under  Sec. 86.001-23.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For manufacturers participating in emission credit trading,  maintain the quarterly records required under Sec. 86.091-7(c)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Projected credits based on information supplied in the  certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of  conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of  end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other compliance  measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be  determined at the end of the model year. Engine families without an  adequate amount of NOX. NOX plus NMHC, and/or  particulate emission credits will violate the conditions of the  certificate of conformity. The certificates of conformity may be voided  ab initio for engine families exceeding the emission standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error  occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this  section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be  recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous  negative balances may be adjusted by EPA for retroactive use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a  credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the  necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that engine family to  zero, using the discount specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section  on the ratio of credits purchased for every credit needed to bring the  balance to zero. If sufficient credits are not available to bring the  credit balance for the family in question to zero, EPA may void the  certificate for that engine family ab initio.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year  report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's  favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the  manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of  the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each participating engine family, NOX plus  NMHC, and particulate emission credits (positive or negative) are to be  calculated according to one of the following equations and rounded, in  accordance with ASTM E29-93a (incorporated by reference at Sec. 86.1),  to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). Consistent units are to be  used throughout the equation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For determining credit need for all engine families and credit  availability for engine families generating credits for averaging  programs only:  Emission credits = (Std - FEL) x (CF) x (UL) x (Production) x  (10-6)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For determining credit availability for engine families  generating credits for trading or banking programs:  Emission credits = (Std - FEL) x (CF) x (UL) x (Production) x  (10-6) x (Discount)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of the equation in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii)  of this section:  Std = the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NOX plus</p><p class="depth4">NMHC or particulate emission standard in grams per brake</p><p class="depth4">horsepower hour or grams per Megajoule. FEL = the NOX plus NMHC, or particulate family emission limit</p><p class="depth4">for the engine family in grams per brake horsepower hour or</p><p class="depth4">grams per Megajoule. CF = a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as given</p><p class="depth4">in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. UL = the useful life described in Sec. 86.004-2, or alternative life as</p><p class="depth4">described in Sec. 86.004-21(f), for the given engine family in</p><p class="depth4">miles. Production = the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within the</p><p class="depth4">given engine family during the model year. Quarterly</p><p class="depth4">production projections are used for initial certification.</p><p class="depth4">Actual production is used for end-of-year compliance</p><p class="depth4">determination. Discount = a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or</p><p class="depth4">traded within the model year generated. Except as otherwise</p><p class="depth4">allowed in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, the</p><p class="depth4">discount applied here is 0.9. Banked credits traded in a</p><p class="depth4">subsequent model year will not be subject to an additional</p><p class="depth4">discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent model year's</p><p class="depth4">averaging program will not have the discount restored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transient cycle conversion factor is the total  (integrated) cycle brake horsepower-hour or Megajoules,   divided by the equivalent mileage of the applicable transient cycle. For  Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3 miles. For  diesel heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested  in the certification of an engine family (as described in Sec. 86.085- 24), the conversion factor used is to be based upon a production  weighted average value of the configurations in an engine family to  calculate the conversion factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Averaging sets for NOX plus NMHC emission credits. The averaging  and trading of NOX plus NMHC emission credits will only be  allowed between heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set.  The averaging sets for the averaging and trading of NOX plus  NMHC emission credits for heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For NOX+NMHC credits from Otto-cycle heavy-duty  engines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set.  Averaging and trading among all Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is  allowed. There are no subclass restrictions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Otto-cycle heavy-duty vehicles certified under the chassis- based provisions of subpart S of this part may not average or trade with  heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines except as allowed in Sec. 86.1817-05(o).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For NOX plus NMHC credits from diesel-cycle heavy- duty engines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each of the three primary intended service classes for heavy- duty diesel engines, as defined in Sec. 86.004-2, constitute an  averaging set. Averaging and trading among all diesel-cycle engine  families within the same primary service class is allowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Urban buses are treated as members of the primary intended  service class where they otherwise would fall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. The averaging  and trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed between  diesel cycle heavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set. The  averaging sets for the averaging and trading of particulate emission  credits for diesel cycle heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines intended for use in urban buses constitute a separate  averaging set from all other heavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading  between diesel cycle bus engine families is allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of  the three primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel cycle  engines, as defined in Sec. 86.004-2, constitute an averaging set.  Averaging and trading between diesel-cycle engine families within the  same primary service class is allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Otto cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging,  trading, or banking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Banking of NOX plus NMHC, and particulate emission credits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Credit deposits. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NOX plus NMHC, and particulate emission  credits may be banked from engine families produced in any model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model  year and after actual credits have been reported to EPA in the end-of- year report. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of- year report, credits originally designated in the certification process  for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for  trading or averaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Credit withdrawals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NOX plus NMHC and particulate  credits generated in 2004 and later model years do not expire.  NOX plus NMHC credits generated by Otto-cycle engines in the  2003 model year for manufacturers selecting Option 1 contained in  Sec. 86.005-10(f)(1) also do not expire.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturers withdrawing banked NOX plus NMHC, and/ or particulate credits shall indicate so during certification and in  their credit reports, as described in Sec. 86.091-23.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall  be within the averaging set and other restrictions described in  paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and only for the following  purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Banked credits may be used in averaging, or in trading, or in  any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits  declared for banking from the previous model year but not reported to  EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the   reported credits can not be proven, they will be revoked and unavailable  for use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Banked credits may not be used for NOX plus NMHC or  particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions that exceed an  FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity  determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by recall testing.  However, banked credits may be used for subsequent production of the  engine family if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NOX credits banked under paragraph Sec. 86.098- 15(j) or Sec. 86.000-15(k) may be used in place of NOX plus  NMHC credits in 2004 and later model years provided that they are used  in the correct averaging set. NOX credits banked under  paragraph Sec. 86.000-15(k) may also be used in place of NOX  plus NMHC credits in the 2003 model year for manufacturers selecting  Option 1 contained in Sec. 86.005-10(f)(1), provided that they are used  in the correct averaging set.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Except for early credits banked under Sec. 86.000-15(k),  NOX credits banked in accordance with Sec. 86.000-15 may not  be used to meet the Otto-cycle engine standards contained in  Sec. 86.005-10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (g) assumes NOX plus NMHC, and  particulate nonconformance penalties (NCPs) will be available for the  2004 and later model year HDEs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engine families using NOX plus NMHC and/or  particulate NCPs but not involved in averaging:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May not generate NOX plus NMHC or particulate credits  for banking and trading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May not use NOX plus NMHC or particulate credits  from banking and trading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a manufacturer has any engine family to which application of  NCPs and banking and trading credits is desired, that family must be  separated into two distinct families. One family, whose FEL equals the  standard, must use NCPs only while the other, whose FEL does not equal  the standard, must use credits only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set  which is using NOX plus NMHC and/or particulate NCPs, none of  that manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may generate  credits for banking and trading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading  situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a type  that is both available in use and expected to be used by the engine  purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the engine  manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the Administrator  that the designated fuel is readily available commercially and would be  used in customer service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Credit apportionment. At the manufacturer's option, credits  generated under the provisions described in this section may be sold to  or otherwise provided to another party for use in programs other than  the averaging, trading and banking program described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall pre-identify two emission levels per  engine family for the purposes of credit apportionment. One emission  level shall be the FEL and the other shall be the level of the standard  that the engine family is required to certify to under Sec. 86.005-10 or  Sec. 86.004-11. For each engine family, the manufacturer may report  engine sales in two categories, ``ABT-only credits'' and  ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For engine sales reported as ``ABT-only credits'', the credits  generated must be used solely in the ABT program described in this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The engine manufacturer may declare a portion of engine sales  ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' and this portion of the credits  generated between the standard and the FEL, based on the calculation in  (c)(1) of this section, would belong to the engine purchaser. For ABT,  the manufacturer may not generate any credits for the engine sales  reported as ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''. Engines reported as  ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' shall comply with the FEL and the  requirements of the ABT program in all other respects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only manufacturer-owned credits reported as ``ABT-only credits''  shall be used in the averaging, trading, and banking provisions  described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Credits shall not be double-counted. Credits used in the ABT  program may not be provided to an engine purchaser for use in another  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturers shall determine and state the number of engines  sold as ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' in  the end-of-model year reports required under Sec. 86.001-23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)(1)</em> or  (2) of this section, a Discount of 1.0 may be used in the trading and  banking calculation, for both NOX plus NMHC and for  particulate, described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family certifies with a certification level of 1.9 g/ bhp-hr NOX plus NMHC or lower for all diesel-cycle engine  families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All of the following must apply to the engine family:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Diesel-cycle engines only;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 2004, 2005, and 2006 model years only;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Must be an engine family using carry-over certification data  from prior to model year 2004 where the NOX plus the HC  certification level prior to model year 2004 is below the NOX  plus NMHC or NOX plus NMHCE standard set forth in  Sec. 86.004-11. Under this option, the NOX credits generated  from this engine family prior to model year 2004 may be used as  NOX plus NMHC credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)(1)</em> or (2) of this  section, a discount of 1.0 may be used in the trading and banking  credits calculation for NOX plus NMHC described in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family has a FEL of 0.5 g/bhp-hr NOX plus  NMHC or lower;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For first three consecutive model years that the engine family  is certified to a NOX plus NMHC standard contained in  Sec. 86.005-10;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The engine family is certified using carry-over data from an  engine family which was used to generate early NOX credits  per Sec. 86.000-15(k) where the sum of the NOX FEL plus the  HC (or hydrocarbon equivalent where applicable) certification level is  below 1.0 g/bhp-hr.
