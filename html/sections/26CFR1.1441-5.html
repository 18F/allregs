                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section describes the rules that apply to  payments made to partnerships, trusts, and estates. Paragraph (b) of  this section prescribes the rules that apply to a withholding agent  making a payment to a U.S. partnership, trust, or estate. It also  prescribes the obligations of a U.S. partnership, trust, or estate that  makes a payment to a foreign partner, beneficiary, or owner. Paragraph  (c) of this section prescribes rules that apply to a withholding agent  that makes a payment to a foreign partnership. Paragraph (d) of this  section provides presumption rules that apply to payments made to  foreign partnerships. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes rules,  including presumption rules, that apply to a withholding agent that  makes a payment to a foreign trust or foreign estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> on a payment of an amount subject  to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that a withholding agent  may treat as made to a U.S. payee. Therefore, if a withholding agent can  reliably associate (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-2(b)(vii)) a Form  W-9 provided in accordance with Sec. 1.1441-1(d)(2) or (4) by a U.S.  partnership, U.S. trust, or a U.S. estate the withholding agent may  treat the payment as made to a U.S. payee and the payment is not subject  to withholding under section 1441 even though the partnership, trust, or  estate may have foreign partners, beneficiaries, or owners. A  withholding agent is also not required to withhold under section 1441 on  a payment it makes to an entity presumed to be a U.S. payee under  paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding by U.S. payees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S. partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. A U.S.   partnership is required to withhold under Sec. 1.1441-1 as a withholding  agent on an amount subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441- 2(a)) that is includible in the gross income of a partner that is a  foreign person. Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, a U.S.  partnership shall withhold when any distributions that include amounts  subject to withholding (including guaranteed payments made by a U.S.  partnership) are made. To the extent a foreign partner's distributive  share of income subject to withholding has not actually been distributed  to the foreign partner, the U.S. partnership must withhold on the  foreign partner's distributive share of the income on the earlier of the  date that the statement required under section 6031(b) is mailed or  otherwise provided to the partner or the due date for furnishing the  statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effectively connected income of partners. Withholding on items  of income that are effectively connected income in the hands of the  partners who are foreign persons is governed by section 1446 and not by  this section. In such a case, partners in a domestic partnership are not  required to furnish a withholding certificate in order to claim an  exemption from withholding under section 1441(c)(1) and Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S. simple trusts. A U.S. trust that is described in section  651(a) (a U.S. simple trust) is required to withhold under chapter 3 of  the Internal Revenue Code as a withholding agent on the distributable  net income includible in the gross income of a foreign beneficiary to  the extent the distributable net income is an amount subject to  withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)). A U.S. simple trust shall  withhold when a distribution is made to a foreign beneficiary. The U.S.  trust may make a reasonable estimate of the portion of the distribution  that constitutes distributable net income consisting of an amount  subject to withholding and apply the appropriate rate of withholding to  the estimated amount. If, at the end of the taxable year in which the  distribution is made, the U.S. simple trust determines that it  underwithheld under section 1441 or 1442, the trust shall be liable as a  withholding agent for the amount under withheld under section 1461. No  penalties shall be imposed for failure to withhold and deposit the tax  if the U.S. simple trust's estimate was reasonable and the trust pays  the underwithheld amount on or before the due date of Form 1042 under  section 1461. Any payment of underwithheld amounts by the U.S. simple  trust shall not be treated as income subject to additional withholding  even if that amount is treated as additional income to the foreign  beneficiary, unless the additional amount is income to the foreign  beneficiary as a result of a contractual arrangement between the parties  regarding the satisfaction of the foreign beneficiary's tax liability.  To the extent a U.S. simple trust is required to, but does not,  distribute such income to a foreign beneficiary, the U.S. trust must  withhold on the foreign beneficiary's allocable share at the time the  income is required (without extension) to be reported on Form 1042-S  under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> U.S. grantor trusts. A U.S. trust that is described in section  671 through 679 (a U.S. grantor trust) must withhold on any income  includible in the gross income of a foreign person that is treated as an  owner of the grantor trust to the extent the amount includible consists  of an amount that is subject to withholding (as described in  Sec. 1.1441-2(a)). The withholding must occur at the time the income is  received by, or credited to, the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subsequent distribution. If a U.S. partnership or U.S. trust  withholds on a foreign partner, beneficiary, or owner's share of an  amount subject to withholding before the amount is actually distributed  to the partner, beneficiary, or owner, withholding is not required when  the amount is subsequently distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the withholding agent can reliably associate a partner's  distributive share of the payment with a valid Form W-9 provided under  Sec. 1.1441-1(d), the partner is a U.S. payee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the withholding agent can reliably associate a partner's  distributive share of the payment with a valid Form W-8, or other  appropriate documentation, provided under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), the  partner is a payee that is a foreign beneficial owner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the withholding agent can reliably associate the partner's  distributive share with a withholding foreign partnership certificate  under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section or a nonwithholding foreign  partnership certificate under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section,  then the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) or paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of  this section shall apply to determine whether the payment is treated as  made to the partners of the higher-tier partnership under this paragraph  (c)(1)(i) or to the higher-tier partnership itself (under the rules of  paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) in the same manner as if the  partner's distributive share of the payment had been paid directly to  the higher-tier foreign partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the withholding agent can reliably associate the partner's  distributive share with a withholding certificate described in paragraph  (e) of this section regarding a foreign trust or estate, then the rules  of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to determine who the payees  are; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the withholding agent cannot reliably associate the partner's  distributive share with a withholding certificate or other appropriate  documentation, the partners are considered to be the payees and the  presumptions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply  to determine their classification and status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments treated as made to the partnership. A payment to a  person that the withholding agent may treat as a foreign partnership is  treated as a payment to the foreign partnership and not to its partners  only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a  withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this  section (withholding certificate of a withholding foreign partnership);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a  withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this  section (nonwithholding foreign partnership) certifying that the payment  is income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The withholding agent can treat the income as effectively  connected income under the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1441-4(a)(2)(ii)  or (3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rules for reliably associating a payment with documentation.  For rules regarding the reliable association of a payment with  documentation, see Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). In the absence of  documentation, see Secs. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 1.6049-5(d) and paragraphs  (d) and (e)(6) of this section for applicable presumptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> and (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> and (B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other information, certifications or statements as may be  required by the withholding foreign partnership agreement with the IRS  or the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of,  the information, statements, and certifications described in this  paragraph (c)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> and must provide it to the withholding agent  upon request.

No withholding statement is required, however,  for a nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate  furnished for income claimed to be effectively connected with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A certification that the income is effectively connected with  the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, if applicable;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any other information, certifications, or statements required by  the form or accompanying instructions in addition to, or in lieu of, the  information and certifications described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> and (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Presumption rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (d) contains  the applicable presumptions for a withholding agent (including a  partnership) to determine the classification and status of   a partnership and its partners in the absence of documentation. The  provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) (regarding the 90-day grace  period) and Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(vii) through (ix) shall apply for  purposes of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> through (d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Foreign trusts and estates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (e)  provides rules applicable to payments of amounts subject to withholding  (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that a withholding agent may treat as  made to any foreign trust or a foreign estate. For rules relating to  payments to a U.S. trust or a U.S. estate, see paragraph (b) of this  section. For the definitions of foreign simple trust, foreign complex  trust, and foreign grantor trust, see Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(24), (25), and  (26).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments to foreign complex trusts and foreign estates. Under  Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(D), a foreign complex trust or foreign estate is  generally considered to be the beneficial owner of income paid to the  foreign complex trust or foreign estate. See paragraph (e)(4) of this  section for rules describing when a withholding agent may treat a  payment as made to a foreign complex trust or a foreign estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>. The payees shall be treated as the beneficial  owners if they may be so treated under Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)(ii)(C) and  they provide documentation supporting their status as the beneficial  owners.

For purposes of this section, a new  withholding certificate is deemed to satisfy the documentation  requirement under the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2001  (see 26 CFR parts 1 and 35a, revised April 1, 1999).

A U.S. trust that  is not a trust described in section 651(a) (see paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of  this section) or sections 671 through 679 (see paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of  this section) (a U.S. complex trust) is required to withhold under  chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) as a withholding agent on  the distributable net income includible in the gross income of a foreign  beneficiary to the extent the distributable net income consists of an  amount subject to withholding (as defined in Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that is,  or is required to be, distributed currently. The U.S. complex trust  shall withhold when a distribution is made to a foreign beneficiary. The  trust may use the same procedures regarding an estimate of the amount  subject to withholding as a U.S. simple trust under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)  of this section. To the extent an amount subject to withholding is  required to be, but is not actually distributed, the U.S. complex trust  must withhold on the foreign beneficiary's allocable share at the time  the income is required to be reported on Form 1042-S under Sec. 1.1461- 1(c), without extension. A U.S. estate is required to withhold under  chapter 3 of the Code on the distributable net income includible in the  gross income of a foreign beneficiary to the extent the distributable  net income consists of an amount subject to withholding (as defined in  Sec. 1.1441-2(a)) that is actually distributed. A U.S. estate may also  use the reasonable estimate procedures of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section.

FP is a nonwithholding foreign partnership organized in  Country X. FP has two partners, FC, a foreign corporation, and USP, a  U.S. partnership. USWH, a U.S. withholding agent, makes a payment of  U.S. source interest to FP that is not a withholdable payment. FP has  provided USWH with a valid nonwithholding foreign partnership  certificate, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, with  which it associates a beneficial owner withholding certificate from FC  and a Form W-9, ``Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and  Certification,'' from USP together with the withholding statement  required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. USWH can reliably  associate the payment of interest with the withholding certificates from  FC and USP. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the payees of the  interest payment are FC and USP.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FP1,  a nonwithholding foreign partnership, is a partner in FP rather than  USP. FP1 has two partners, A and B, both foreign persons. FP provides  USWH with a valid nonwithholding foreign partnership certificate, as  described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, with which it  associates a beneficial owner withholding certificate from FC and a  nonwithholding foreign partnership certificate from FP1. In addition,  foreign beneficial owner withholding certificates from A and B are  associated with the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding  certificate from FP1. FP also provides the withholding statement  required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. USWH can reliably  associate the interest payment with the withholding certificates  provided by FC, A, and B. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section, the payees of the interest payment are FC, A, and B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. USWH makes a payment of U.S. source dividends to WFP, a  withholding foreign partnership, that is not a withholdable payment. WFP  has two partners, FC1 and FC2, both foreign corporations. USWH can  reliably associate the payment with a valid withholding foreign  partnership withholding certificate from WFP. Therefore, under paragraph  (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, WFP is the payee of the interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. USWH makes a payment of U.S. source royalties that is not  a withholdable payment to FP, a foreign partnership. USWH can reliably  associate the royalties with a valid withholding certificate from FP on  which FP certifies that the income is effectively connected with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Therefore, under  paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, FP is the payee of the  royalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding foreign partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reliance on claim of  withholding foreign partnership status. A withholding foreign  partnership is a foreign partnership that has entered into an agreement  with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as described in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section, with respect to distributions and guaranteed  payments it makes to its partners. A withholding   agent that can reliably associate a payment with a certificate described  in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section may treat the person to whom it  makes the payment as a withholding foreign partnership for purposes of  withholding under chapters 3 and 4 of the Code, information reporting  under chapter 61 of the Code, backup withholding under section 3406, and  withholding under other provisions of the Code. Furnishing such a  certificate is in lieu of transmitting to a withholding agent  withholding certificates or other appropriate documentation for its  partners. Although the withholding foreign partnership generally will be  required to obtain withholding certificates or other appropriate  documentation from its partners pursuant to its agreement with the IRS,  it will generally not be required to attach such documentation to its  withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate to the extent it  is permitted to act as a withholding foreign partnership with respect to  the payment under its agreement. A foreign partnership may act as a  qualified intermediary under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5) with respect to  payments it makes to persons other than its partners. In addition, the  IRS may permit a foreign partnership to act as a qualified intermediary  under Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D) with respect to its partners in  appropriate circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withholding agreement. The IRS may, upon request, enter into a  withholding agreement with a foreign partnership pursuant to such  procedures as the IRS may prescribe in published guidance (see  Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). Under the withholding agreement, a  foreign partnership shall generally be subject to the applicable  withholding and reporting provisions applicable to withholding agents  (and payors as defined in Sec. 1.6049-4(a) under chapters 3, 4, and 61  of the Code, section 3406, the regulations under those provisions, and  other withholding provisions of the Code, except to the extent provided  under the agreement. Under the agreement, a foreign partnership may  agree to act as an acceptance agent to perform the duties described in  Sec. 301.6109-1(d)(3)(iv)(A) of this chapter. For a partnership that  receives withholdable payments on behalf of its partners and that is an  FFI, the agreement will require the partnership to assume the  requirements of a participating FFI, a registered deemed-compliant FFI,  or an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable IGA that  is subject to due diligence and reporting requirements with respect to  its U.S. accounts similar to those applicable to a registered deemed- compliant FFI under Sec. 1.1471-5(f)(1). The agreement may specify the  manner in which applicable procedures for adjustments for  underwithholding and overwithholding, including refund procedures, apply  to the withholding foreign partnership and its partners and the extent  to which applicable procedures may be modified. In particular, a  withholding agreement may allow a withholding foreign partnership to  claim refunds of overwithheld amounts on behalf of its customers. In  addition, the agreement must specify the manner in which the IRS will  verify the partnership's compliance with its agreement, including the  requirements for a periodic review of the partnership's compliance with  the agreement and the procedures for the partnership to certify to its  compliance with the agreement. A withholding foreign partnership must  file a return on Form 1042, ``Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S.  Source Income of Foreign Persons,'' and information returns on Form  1042-S, ``Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding.''  The withholding foreign partnership agreement may also require a  withholding foreign partnership to file a partnership return under  section 6031(a) and partner statements under 6031(b), including for each  U.S. partner to the extent required in the agreement. Additionally, a  partnership that is an FFI will be required to file Form 8966, ``FATCA  Report,'' to the extent provided in the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Withholding responsibility. A withholding foreign partnership  must assume primary withholding responsibility under both chapters 3 and  4 of the Code. It is not required to provide information to the  withholding agent regarding each partner's distributive share of the  payment (including a withholdable payment). The withholding foreign  partnership will be responsible for reporting the payments   under Sec. 1.1461-1(c), Sec. 1.1474-1(d), and chapter 61 of the Code and  filing Form 1042 (to the extent required in the agreement). A  withholding agent making a payment to a withholding foreign partnership  is not required to withhold any amount under chapters 3 and 4 of the  Code on the payment unless it has actual knowledge or reason to know  that the foreign partnership is not acting as a withholding foreign  partnership with respect to the payment or has not withheld to the  extent required. The withholding foreign partnership shall withhold the  payments under the same procedures and at the same time as prescribed  for withholding by a U.S. partnership under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, except that, for purposes of determining the partner's status,  the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent residence address (as described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), the employer identification number of the  partnership, the country under the laws of which the partnership is  created or governed, the chapter 4 status of the partnership if required  for purposes of chapter 4 or if the partnership provides (or will  provide) a withholding statement associated with the Form W-8 allocating  a payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under  Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4) with respect to its partners, and the GIIN of the  partnership (if applicable). If the partnership provides (or will  provide) a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees as described  in the preceding sentence, the partnership must certify to its chapter 4  status as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or  registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A certification that the partnership is a withholding foreign  partnership within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section,  and, for a partnership that is an FFI receiving a withholdable payment,  a certification that the partnership is acting as a participating FFI, a  registered deemed-compliant FFI, or a nonreporting IGA FFI (as defined  in Sec. 1.1471-1(b)(83)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonwithholding foreign partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reliance on claim of  foreign partnership status. A withholding agent may treat a person as a  nonwithholding foreign partnership if it receives from that person a  nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate as described  in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. A withholding agent that does  not receive a nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding  certificate, or does not receive a valid withholding certificate, from  an entity it knows, or has reason to know, is a foreign partnership,  must apply the presumption rules of Secs. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 1.6049-5(d)  and paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section. In addition, to the  extent a withholding agent cannot, prior to a payment, reliably  associate the payment with valid documentation from a payee that is  associated with the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding  certificate or has insufficient information to report the payment on  Form 1042-S or Form 1099, to the extent reporting is required, the  withholding agent must apply the presumption rules. See Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(2)(vii)(A) and (b)(2)(vii)(B) for rules regarding reliable  association. See, however, Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(2) for when a  withholding agent may reliably associate a withholdable payment with a  chapter 4 withholding rate pool in lieu of obtaining documentation for  each payee included in the pool (substituting the term nonwithholding  foreign partnership for the term nonqualified intermediary). See also  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(A) for when a withholding agent may reliably  associate a payment with a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S.  payees. See paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section and Sec. 1.1441- 1(e)(3)(iv) for alternative procedures permitting allocation information  to be received after a payment is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> describes the manner in which a  withholding agent may rely on a claim of reduced withholding when making  a payment to a nonwithholding foreign partnership. To the extent that a  withholding agent   treats a payment to a nonwithholding foreign partnership as a payment to  the nonwithholding foreign partnership's partners (whether direct or  indirect) in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, it may  rely on a claim for reduced withholding by the partner if, prior to the  payment, the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid  withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation from the  partner that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding. A  withholding certificate or other appropriate documentation that  establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of withholding is a beneficial  owner withholding certificate described in Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i),  documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.1441-6(c)(3) or (4) or  Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) (for a partner claiming to be a foreign person and a  beneficial owner, determined under the provisions of Sec. 1.1441- 1(c)(6)), a Form W-9 described in Sec. 1.1441-1(d) (for a partner  claiming to be a U.S. payee), a withholding foreign partnership  withholding certificate described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this  section, or a withholding statement allocating the payment to a chapter  4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. For when the withholding agent  can reliably associate the payment with a chapter 4 withholding rate  pool, see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. See also Sec. 1.1441- 3(a)(2) (coordinating withholding under chapter 3 when withholding under  chapter 4 is applied to a payment). Unless a nonwithholding foreign  partnership withholding certificate is provided for income claimed to be  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States, a claim must be presented for each portion of the payment  that represents an item of income includible in the distributive share  of a partner as required under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.  When making a claim for several partners, the partnership may present a  single nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding certificate to  which the partners' certificates or other appropriate documentation are  associated. Where the nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding  certificate is provided for income claimed to be effectively connected  with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under  paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D) of this section, the claim may be presented  without having to identify any partner's distributive share of the  payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent residence address (as described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), the employer identification number of the  partnership, if any, the country under the laws of which the partnership  is created or governed, and the chapter 4 status of the partnership (for  a nonwithholding foreign partnership receiving a withholdable payment or  providing a withholding statement associated with the Form W-8  allocating a payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S.  payees), and the GIIN of the partnership (if applicable);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> through (c)(3)(iii)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> (regarding a withholding statement) shall apply  to a nonwithholding foreign partnership by substituting the term  nonwithholding foreign partnership for the term nonqualified  intermediary, including when a nonwithholding foreign partnership may  provide to a withholding agent a withholding statement that includes a  chapter 4 withholding rate pool in lieu of information with respect to  each partner that is a payee of a payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>. A nonwithholding foreign  partnership shall not be required to withhold and report if it has  provided a valid nonwithholding foreign partnership withholding  certificate, it has provided all   of the information required by paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section  (withholding statement), and it does not know, and has no reason to  know, that another withholding agent failed to withhold the correct  amount or failed to report the payment correctly under Sec. 1.1461-1(c).  A nonwithholding foreign partnership is also not required to withhold  and report under this paragraph (c)(3) to the extent that withholding  under chapter 4 was applied to a payment that is includible in the gross  income of a partner in the partnership. See also Sec. 1.1441-3(a)(2) for  coordination rules when withholding under chapter 4 has been applied to  a withholdable payment. A withholding foreign partnership's obligations  to withhold and report shall be determined in accordance with its  withholding foreign partnership agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(vii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> that is a withholdable  payment, see Sec. 1.1471-3(f)(5) for the presumption rule for  determining the payee's chapter 4 status to determine whether  withholding under chapter 4 applies to the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination by a withholding foreign partnership of the status  of its partners. Except as otherwise provided in the agreement described  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a withholding foreign partnership  shall determine whether the partners or some other persons are the  payees of the partners' distributive shares of any payment made by a  withholding foreign partnership by applying the rules of Sec. 1.1441- 1(b)(2), paragraph (c)(1) of this section (in the case of a partner that  is a foreign partnership), and paragraph (e)(3) of this section (in the  case of a partner that is a foreign estate or a foreign trust). Further,  the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply to  determine the status of partners and the applicable withholding rates to  the extent that, at the time the foreign partnership is required to  withhold on a payment, it cannot reliably associate the amount with  documentation for any one or more of its partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (e)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Coordination with chapter 4 for payments made to foreign  simple trusts   and foreign grantor trusts. A withholding agent that makes a payment of  U.S. source FDAP income to a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor  trust that is a withholdable payment to which withholding under chapter  4 applies must apply the rules described in Sec. 1.1473-1(a)(5)(vi) to  determine when the payment is treated as made to a beneficiary or owner  of the trust for purposes of chapter 4. In a case in which withholding  applies under chapter 4 to a withholdable payment made to a foreign  simple trust or foreign grantor trust, see Sec. 1.1441-3(a)(2) to  coordinate withholding otherwise required under this paragraph (e) with  respect to the amount of the payment included in the gross income of the  payee of the payment. For when a withholding agent may reliably  associate a withholdable payment with a chapter 4 withholding rate pool  in lieu of obtaining documentation for each payee included in the pool,  see Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(2) (substituting the term nonwithholding  foreign trust for the term nonqualified intermediary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Foreign simple trust and foreign grantor trust--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reliance on  claim of foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust status. A  withholding agent may treat a person as a foreign simple trust or  foreign grantor trust if it receives from that person a foreign simple  trust or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate as described in  paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section. A withholding agent must apply  the presumption rules of Secs. 1.1441-1(b)(3) and 1.6049-5(d) and  paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section to the extent it cannot, prior  to the payment, reliably associate a payment (within the meaning of  Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid foreign simple trust or foreign  grantor trust withholding certificate, it cannot reliably determine how  much of the payment relates to valid documentation provided by a payee  (e.g., a person that is not itself a nonqualified intermediary, flow- through entity, or U.S. branch) associated with the foreign simple trust  or foreign grantor trust withholding certificate, or it does not have  sufficient information to report the payment on Form 1042-S or Form  1099, if reporting is required. See Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)(A) and  (b)(2)(vii)(B). See, however, Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(2) for when a  withholding agent may reliably associate a withholdable payment with a  chapter 4 withholding rate pool in lieu of obtaining documentation for  each payee included in a pool (substituting the term nonwithholding  foreign trust for the term nonqualified intermediary). See also  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(A) for when a withholding agent may reliably  associate a payment with a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S.  payees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> describes the manner in which a withholding agent  may rely on a claim of reduced withholding when making a payment to a  foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust. To the extent that a  withholding agent treats a payment to a foreign simple trust or foreign  grantor trust as a payment to payees other than the trust in accordance  with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, it may rely on a claim for  reduced withholding by a beneficiary or owner if, prior to the payment,  the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) with a valid withholding  certificate or other appropriate documentation from a payee or  beneficial owner that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of  withholding. A withholding certificate or other appropriate  documentation that establishes entitlement to a reduced rate of  withholding is a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) or documentary evidence described in Sec. 1.1441- 6(c)(3) or (c)(4) or in Sec. 1.6049-5(c)(1) (for a beneficiary or owner  claiming to be a foreign person and a beneficial owner, determined under  the provisions of Sec. 1.1441-1(c)(6)), a Form W-9 described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(d) (for a beneficiary or owner claiming to be a U.S.  payee), a withholding foreign partnership withholding certificate  described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, or a withholding  statement allocating the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of  U.S. payees.   For when the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a  chapter 4 withholding rate pool, see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section. See also Sec. 1.1441-3(a)(2) (coordinating withholding under  chapter 3 when withholding under chapter 4 is applied to a withholdable  payment). Unless a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust  withholding certificate is provided for income treated as income  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States, a claim must be presented for each payee's portion of the  payment. When making a claim for several payees, the trust may present a  single foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust withholding  certificate with which the payees' certificates or other appropriate  documentation are associated. Where the foreign simple trust or foreign  grantor trust withholding certificate is provided for income that is  treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States under paragraph (e)(5)(iii)(D) of this section, the  claim may be presented without having to identify any beneficiary's or  grantor's distributive share of the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, permanent residence address (as described in  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(2)(ii)), the employer identification number, if  required, of the trust, the country under the laws of which the trust is  created, the chapter 4 status of the trust if required for purposes of  chapter 4 or if the trust provides (or will provide) a withholding  statement associated with the Form W-8 allocating a payment to a chapter  4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees under Sec. 1.6049-4(c)(4) with  respect to the nonwithholding foreign trust's owners and beneficiaries,  and the GIIN of the trust (if applicable). If a nonwithholding foreign  trust provides (or will provide) a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of  U.S. payees as described in the preceding sentence, the trust must  certify to its chapter 4 status as a participating FFI (including a  reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a  reporting Model 1 FFI);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> through (e)(5)(iii)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>  (regarding a withholding statement) shall apply to a foreign simple  trust or foreign grantor trust by substituting the term foreign simple  trust or foreign grantor trust for the term nonqualified intermediary,  including when a withholding statement provided by a foreign simple  trust or foreign grantor trust may include a chapter 4 withholding rate  pool in lieu of information with respect to each owner or beneficiary  that is a payee of a payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Withholding foreign trusts. The IRS may enter an agreement with  a foreign trust to treat the trust or estate as a withholding foreign  trust. Such an agreement shall generally follow the same principles as  an agreement with a withholding foreign partnership under paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section. A withholding agent may treat a payment to a  withholding foreign trust in the same manner the withholding agent would  treat a payment (including a withholdable payment) to a withholding  foreign partnership. The IRS may also enter an agreement to treat a  trust as a qualified intermediary in appropriate circumstances. See  Sec. 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii)(D). For a withholding foreign trust that is an  FFI and that receives withholdable payments on behalf of its owners or  beneficiaries, the agreement will require the withholding foreign trust  to assume the requirements of either a participating FFI, registered  deemed-compliant FFI, or an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under  an applicable IGA that is subject to due diligence and reporting  requirements with respect to its U.S. accounts similar to those  applicable to a registered deemed-compliant FFI under Sec. 1.1471- 5(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>. If, based upon those  presumptions, the withholding agent classifies the payee as a trust or  estate, the withholding agent shall apply the presumptions set forth in  Sec. 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(A)(1) (applied by substituting the term trust  for the term exempt recipient) to determine whether the trust or estate  is a U.S. person or foreign person. An undocumented payee presumed to be  a foreign trust shall be presumed to be a foreign complex trust. If a  withholding agent has documentary evidence that establishes that an  entity is a foreign trust, but the withholding agent cannot determine  whether the foreign trust is a complex trust, a simple trust, or foreign  grantor trust, the withholding agent shall presume that the trust is a  foreign complex trust. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the  case of a foreign trust with a settlor that is a U.S. person for which a  withholding agent has both a U.S. address and TIN, the withholding agent  shall presume that the trust is a grantor trust when it cannot determine  the status of the trust as a simple trust, complex trust, or grantor  trust.
