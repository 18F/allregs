A  threatened species is one in danger of becoming an endangered species in  the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its  range. Listings of threatened and endangered species as well as critical  habitats are maintained by some individual States and by the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior (codified  annually at 50 CFR 17.11). The Department of Commerce has authority over  some threatened and endangered marine mammals, fish and reptiles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible loss of values: The major potential impacts on  threatened or endangered species from the discharge of dredged or fill  material include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covering or otherwise directly killing species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The impairment or destruction of habitat to which these species  are limited. Elements of the aquatic habitat which are particularly  crucial to the continued survival of some threatened or endangered  species include adequate good quality water, spawning and maturation  areas, nesting areas, protective cover, adequate and reliable food  supply, and resting areas for migratory species. Each of these elements  can be adversely affected by changes in either   the normal water conditions for clarity, chemical content, nutrient  balance, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity, current patterns,  circulation and fluctuation, or the physical removal of habitat; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facilitating incompatible activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where consultation with the Secretary of the Interior occurs  under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, the conclusions of the  Secretary concerning the impact(s) of the discharge on threatened and  endangered species and their habitat shall be considered final.</p>
