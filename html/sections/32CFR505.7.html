The twelve exceptions to the ``no disclosure without consent'' rule are those exceptions which permit the release of personal information without the individual's/subject's consent (See appendix C of this part).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The FOIA requires the release of the record. One of the twelve exceptions to Privacy Act is the FOIA Exception. If the FOIA requires the release of information, the information must be released. The Privacy Act can not prevent release to a third party if the FOIA requires release. However, information must not be discretionarily released under the FOIA if the information is subject to the Privacy Act's ``no disclosure without consent'' rule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A routine use applies. Another major exception to the ``no disclosure without consent'' rule is the routine use exception. The Privacy Act allows federal agencies to publish routine use exceptions to the Privacy Act. Some routine uses are Army specific, DOD specific, and Governmentwide. Routine uses exceptions are listed in the Privacy Act system of records notice(s) applicable to the Privacy Act records in question. The Army and other agencies' system of records notices may be accessed at the Defense Privacy Office's Web site http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The approved twelve exceptions to the Privacy Act ``no disclosure without consent'' rule are listed at appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosing records to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD. (1) The twelve Privacy Act exceptions referred to in appendix C of this part are available to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD as exceptions to the Privacy Act's ``no disclosure without consent'' rule, with the exception of the FOIA exception. The FOIA is not an appropriate mechanism for providing information to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The twelve Privacy Act exceptions referred to in appendix C of this part are available to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD as exceptions to the Privacy Act's ``no disclosure without consent'' rule, with the exception of the FOIA exception. The FOIA is not an appropriate mechanism for providing information to other DOD components and to federal agencies outside the DOD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A widely used exception to requests for information from local and state government agencies and federal agencies not within the DOD is the routine use exception to the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The most widely used exception to requests for information from other DOD components is the ``intra-agency

need to know'' exception to the Privacy Act. Officers and employees of the DOD who have an official need for the records in the performance of their official duties are entitled to Privacy Act protected information. Rank, position, or title alone does not authorize access to personal information about others. An official need for the information must exist before disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the purposes of disclosure and disclosure accounting, the Department of Defense (DOD) is considered a single agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclosures under AR 25-55, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program.

The FOIA requires release unless the information is exempted by one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Required release under the FOIA. The following are examples of personal information that is generally not exempt from the FOIA; therefore, it must be released to the public, unless covered by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. The following list is not all inclusive:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Military Personnel--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Rank, date of rank, active duty entry date, basic pay entry date, and gross pay (including base pay, special pay, and all allowances except Basic Allowance for Housing);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Present and past duty assignments, future stateside assignments;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Office/unit name, duties address and telephone number (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Source of commission, promotion sequence number, military awards and decorations, and professional military education;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Duty status, at any given time;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Separation or retirement dates;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Military occupational specialty (MOS);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific or professional meetings; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Biographies and photos of key personnel (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Federal civilian employees--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Present and past position titles, occupational series, and grade;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Present and past annual salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious or Distinguished Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Present and past duty stations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Office or duty telephone number (DOD policy may require withholding of this information in certain circumstances); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Position descriptions, identification of job elements, and performance standards (but not actual performance appraisals), the release of which would not interfere with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit agency effectiveness. Performance elements and standards (or work expectations) may also be withheld when they are so intertwined with performance appraisals, the disclosure would reveal an individual's performance appraisal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Personal information that requires protection.

In general, the Department of Defense has specifically advised that DOD components are not to release lists of names, duty addresses, present or past position titles, grades, salaries, and performance standards of DOD military members and civilian employees. At the office director level or above, the release of information will be limited to the name, official title, organization, and telephone number, provided a determination is made that disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns. No other information, including room numbers, will normally be released about these officials. Consistent with current policy, information on officials below the office director level may continue to be released if their positions or duties require frequent interaction with the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of records pertaining to personnel of overseas, sensitive, or routinely deployed units shall be prohibited to the extent authorized by 10 U.S.C. 130b.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Release of home addresses and home telephone numbers.

In such cases, the requester shall be notified of the referral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Do not sell or rent lists of individual names and addresses unless such action is specifically authorized by the appropriate authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emergency recall rosters. (1) The release of emergency recall rosters normally is prohibited. Their release is normally considered a clearly ``unwarranted invasion'' of personal privacy and is exempt from mandatory release under the FOIA. Emergency recall rosters should only be shared with those who have an ``official need to know'' the information, and they should be marked ``For Official Use Only'' (See AR 25-55).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The release of emergency recall rosters normally is prohibited.

However, new or changed routine uses must be published in the Federal Register at least 30 days before actually disclosing any records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition to the routine uses listed in the applicable systems of records notices, ``Blanket Routine Uses'' for all DOD maintained systems of records have been established.
