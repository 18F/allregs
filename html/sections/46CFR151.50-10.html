                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of this part, alkylene oxides are considered to  be ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alkylene oxides transported under the provisions of this part  shall be acetylene free.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No other product may be transported in tanks certified for an  alkylene oxide except that the Commandant may approve subsequent  transportation of other products and return to alkylene oxide service if  tanks, piping and auxiliary equipment are adequately cleaned to the  satisfaction of the Marine Inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless authorized by the Commandant, no other kind of cargo  except methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane shall be on board a  tank vessel certificated for the carriage of an alkylene oxide at the  same time an alkylene oxide in either the liquid or vapor state is  present in any cargo tank. Alkylene oxide tanks shall not be installed  in tanks intended for any other cargo.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All valves, flanges, fittings, and accessory equipment shall be  of a type suitable for use with the alkylene oxides and shall be made of  steel or stainless steel, or other materials acceptable to the  Commandant. Impurities of copper, magnesium and other acetylide-forming  metals shall be kept to a minimum. The chemical composition of all  material used shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval prior to  fabrication. Disks or disk faces, seats and other wearing parts of  valves shall be made of stainless steel containing not less than 11  percent chromium. Mercury, silver, aluminum, magnesium, copper, and  their alloys shall not be used for any valves, gauges, thermometers, or  any similar devices. Gaskets shall be constructed of spirally wound  stainless steel with ``Teflon'' or other suitable material. All packing  and gaskets shall be constructed of materials which do not react  spontaneously with or lower the autoignition temperature of the alkylene  oxides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The pressure rating of valves, fittings, and accessories shall  be not less than the maximum pressure for which the cargo tank is  designed, or the shutoff head of the cargo pump, whichever is greater,  but in no case less than 150 pounds per square inch. Welded fittings  manufactured in accordance with A.N.S.I. Standards shall be used  wherever possible, and the number of pipe joints shall be held to a  minimum. Threaded joints in the cargo liquid and vapor lines are  prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The thermometer shall terminate in the liquid space and shall be  attached to the shell by welding with the end of the fitting being  provided with a gastight screwed plug or bolted cover.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Automatic float continuous reading tape gauge, and similar  types, shall be fitted with a shutoff valve located as close to the tank  as practicable, which shall be designed to close automatically in the  event of fracture of the external gauge piping. An auxiliary gauging  device shall always be used in conjunction with an automatic gauging  device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Filling and discharge piping shall extend to within 4 inches of  the bottom of the tank or sump pit if one is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Venting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The discharge fittings from each safety relief or  pressure vacuum relief valve shall be directed in such a manner as to  not impinge on another tank, piping or any other equipment which would  increase the fire hazard should burning products be discharged from the  safety or pressure vacuum relief valve as a result of a fire or other  casualty. In addition, the discharges shall be directed away from areas  where it is likely that persons   might be working and as remote as practicable from ventilation inlets  and ignition sources. A common discharge header may be employed if  desired. The area near the discharge fittings shall be clearly marked as  a hazardous area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A means shall be provided for either the reclamation or safe  venting of vapors during the loading and unloading operations. For this  purpose, the safety relief or pressure vacuum relief valve shall be  provided with a valved bypass to a vapor return line shore connection  which shall be used whenever vapor return shore facilities are  available. In the event vapors must be vented to the atmosphere, a vent  riser shall be connected to the vapor return line and extend at least 12  feet above the highest level accessible to personnel. The vent riser may  be collapsible for ease of stowage when not in use. The vent riser shall  not be connected to a safety relief or pressure vacuum valve. Vapor  return lines or vent risers for tanks carrying the same class product  may be connected to a common header system if desired. Tanks carrying  alkylene oxides shall be vented independent of tanks carrying other  products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The outlet of each vent riser shall be fitted with acceptable  corrosion-resistant flame screen of suitable material or a flame  arrester suitable for use with alkylene oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Ventilation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All enclosed spaces within the hull shall be  vented or ventilated in accordance with the provisions of this  subchapter except as otherwise provided for in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The enclosed spaces in which the cargo tanks are located shall  be inerted by injection of a suitable inert gas or shall be well  ventilated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The enclosed spaces in which the cargo tanks are located, if an  inerting system is not installed, shall be fitted with forced  ventilation of such capacity to provide a complete change of air every  three minutes and arranged in such a manner that any vapors lost into  the space will be removed. The ventilation system shall be in operation  at all times cargo is being loaded or discharged. No electrical  equipment shall be fitted within the spaces or within ten feet of the  ventilation exhaust from these spaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All ventilation machinery shall be of nonsparking construction  and shall not provide a source of vapor ignition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each vent shall be fitted with a flame screen of corrosion  resistant wire which is suitable for use with the alkylene oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flexible metal hose fabricated of stainless steel or other  acceptable material, resistant to the action of the alkylene oxide,  shall be fitted to the liquid and vapor lines during cargo transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hose shall be marked with the maximum pressure guaranteed by  the manufacturer, and with his certification with the words ``Certified  for _____ Oxide.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cargo hose intended for alkylene oxide service shall not be used  for any other products except those which are compatible with the  alkylene oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Vessel shall be electrically bonded to the shore piping prior to  connecting the cargo hose. This electrical bonding shall be maintained  until after the cargo hose has been disconnected and any spillage has  been removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Cargo shall be discharged by pumping or by displacement with  nitrogen or other acceptable inert gas. In no case shall air be allowed  to enter the system. During loading and unloading operations, the vapor  shall not be discharged to the atmosphere. Provisions shall be made to  return all displaced vapor to the loading facility. The loading rate and  the pressure applied to the tank to discharge the cargo shall be so  limited to prevent opening the safety relief valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> During cargo transfer, a water hose with pressure to the nozzle,  when atmospheric temperatures permit, shall be connected to a water  supply for immediate use during filling and discharge operations and any  spillage of alkylene oxide shall be immediately washed away. This  requirement can be met by facilities provided from shore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Prior to disconnecting shore lines, the pressure in the liquid  and vapor lines shall be relieved through suitable valves installed at  the loading header. The liquid and vapor discharged from these lines  shall not be discharged to atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The safety relief valves shall be tested by liquid, gas, or  vapor pressure   at least once every 2 years to determine the accuracy of adjustment and,  if necessary, shall be reset. Alkylene oxides shall not be used as the  testing medium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The special requirements for ethylene oxide contained in Sec.   151.50-12 and for propylene oxide contained in Sec.  151.50-13 shall  also be observed.
