                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 4 of the Portal Act does not affect the computation of  hours worked within the ``workday'' proper, roughly described as the  period ``from whistle to whistle,'' and its provisions have nothing to  do with the compensability under the Fair Labor Standards Act of any  activities engaged in by an employee during that period. \34\ Under the  provisions of section 4, one of the conditions that must be present  before ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activities are excluded from  hours worked is that they `occur either prior to the time on any  particular workday at which the employee commences, or subsequent to the  time on any particular workday at which he ceases' the principal  activity or activities which he is employed to perform. Accordingly, to  the extent that activities engaged in by an employee occur after the  employee commences to perform the first principal activity on a  particular workday and before he ceases the performance of the last  principal activity on a particular workday, the provisions of that  section have no application. Periods of time between the commencement of  the employee's first principal activity and the completion of his last  principal activity on any workday must be included in the computation of  hours worked to the same extent as would be required if the Portal Act  had not been enacted. \35\ The principles for determining hours worked  within the ``workday'' proper will continue to be those established  under the Fair Labor Standards Act without reference to the Portal Act,  \36\ which is concerned with this question only as it relates to time  spent outside the ``workday'' in activities of the kind described in  section 4. \37\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\34\ The report of the Senate Judiciary Committee states (p. 47),  ``Activities of an employee which take place during the workday are * *  * not affected by this section (section 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act,  as finally enacted) and such activities will continue to be compensable  or not without regard to the provisions of this section.''</p><p class="depth2">\35\ See Senate Report, pp. 47, 48; Conference Report, p. 12;  statement of Senator Wiley, explaining the conference agreement to the  Senate, 93 Cong.

It includes all time within  that period whether or not the employee engages in work throughout all  of that period. For example, a rest period or a lunch period is part of  the ``workday'', and section 4 of the Portal Act therefore plays no part  in determining whether such a period, under the particular circumstances  presented, is or is not compensable, or whether it should be included in  the computation of hours worked. \38\ If an employee is required to  report at the actual place of performance of his principal activity at a  certain specific time, his ``workday'' commences at the time he reports  there for work in accordance with the employer's requirement, even  though through a cause beyond the employee's control, he is not able to  commence performance of his productive activities until a later time. In  such a situation the time spent waiting for work would be part of the  workday, \39\ and section 4 of the Portal Act would not affect its  inclusion in hours worked for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\38\ Senate Report, pp. 47, 48.

[12 FR 7655, Nov. 18, 1947, as amended at 35 FR 7383, May 12, 1970]     Sec. 790.7  ``Preliminary'' and ``postliminary'' activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Since section 4 of the Portal Act applies only to situations  where employees engage in ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activities  outside the workday proper, it is necessary to consider what activities  fall within this description. The fact that an employee devotes some of  his time to an activity of this type is, however, not a sufficient  reason for disregarding the time devoted to such activity in computing  hours worked. If such time would otherwise be counted as time worked  under the Fair Labor Standards Act, section 4 may not change the  situation. Whether such time must be counted or may be disregarded, and  whether the relief from liability or punishment afforded by section 4 of  the Portal Act is available to the employer in such a situation will  depend on the compensability of the activity under contract, custom, or  practice within the meaning of that section. \40\ On the other hand, the  criteria described in the Portal Act have no bearing on the  compensability or the status as worktime under the Fair Labor Standards  Act of activities that are not ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary''  activities outside the workday. \41\ And even where there is a contract,  custom, or practice to pay for time spent in such a ``preliminary'' or  ``postliminary'' activity, section 4(d) of the Portal Act does not make  such time hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act, if it would  not be so counted under the latter Act alone. \42\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\40\ See Conference Report. pp. 10, 12, 13; statements of Senator  Donnell, 93 Cong.

See also Sec. 790.6.</p><p class="depth2">\42\ See Sec. 790.5(a). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The words ``preliminary activity'' mean an activity engaged in  by an employee before the commencement of his ``principal'' activity or  activities, and the words ``postliminary activity'' means an activity  engaged in by an employee after the completion of his ``principal''  activity or activities. No categorical list of ``preliminary'' and  ``postliminary'' activities except those named in the Act can be made,  since activities which under one set of circumstances may be  ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activities, may under other  conditions be ``principal'' activities. The following ``preliminary'' or  ``postliminary'' activities are expressly mentioned in the Act:  ``Walking, riding, or traveling to or from the actual place of  performance of the principal activity or activities which (the) employee  is employed to perform.'' \43\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\43\ Portal Act, subsections 4(a), 4(d). See also Conference Report,  p. 13; statement of Senator Donnell, 93 Cong. Rec. 2181, 2362. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The statutory language and the legislative history indicate that  the ``walking, riding or traveling'' to which section 4(a) refers is  that which occurs, whether on or off the employer's premises, in the  course of an employee's ordinary daily trips between his home or lodging  and the actual place where he does what he is employed to do. It does  not, however, include travel from the place of performance of one  principal activity to the place of performance of another, nor does it  include travel during the employee's regular working hours. \44\ For  example, travel by a repairman from one place where he performs repair  work to another such place, or travel by a messenger delivering  messages, is not the kind of ``walking, riding or traveling'' described  in section 4(a). Also, where an employee travels outside his regular  working hours at the direction and on the business of his employer, the  travel   would not ordinarily be ``walking, riding, or traveling'' of the type  referred to in section 4(a). One example would be a traveling employee  whose duties require him to travel from town to town outside his regular  working hours; another would be an employee who has gone home after  completing his day's work but is subsequently called out at night to  travel a substantial distance and perform an emergency job for one of  his employer's customers. \45\ In situations such as these, where an  employee's travel is not of the kind to which section 4(a) of the Portal  Act refers, the question whether the travel time is to be counted as  worktime under the Fair Labor Standards Act will continue to be  determined by principles established under this Act, without reference  to the Portal Act. \46\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\44\ These conclusions are supported by the limitation, ``to and  from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or  activities which (the) employee is employed to perform,'' which follows  the term ``walking, riding or traveling'' in section 4(a), and by the  additional limitation applicable to all ``preliminary'' and  ``postliminary'' activities to the effect that the Act may affect them  only if they occur ``prior to'' or ``subsequent to'' the workday. See,  in this connection the statements of Senator Donnell, 93 Conf. Rec.  2121, 2181, 2182, 2363; statement of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2297.  See also Senate Report, pp. 47, 48.</p><p class="depth2">\45\ The report of the Senate Judiciary Committee (p. 48) emphasized  that this section of the Act ``does not attempt to cover by specific  language that many thousands of situations that do not readily fall  within the pattern of the ordinary workday.''</p><p class="depth2">\46\ These principles are discussed in part 785 of this chapter. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee who walks, rides or otherwide travels while  performing active duties is not engaged in the activities described in  section 4(a). An illustration of such travel would be the carrying by a  logger of a portable power saw or other heavy equipment (as  distinguished from ordinary hand tools) on his trip into the woods to  the cutting area. In such a situation, the walking, riding, or traveling  is not segreable from the simultaneous performance of his assigned work  (the carrying of the equipment, etc.) and it does not constitute travel  ``to and from the actual place of performance'' of the principal  activities he is employed to perform. \47\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\47\ Senator Cooper, after explaining that the ``principal''  activities referred to include activities which are an integral part of  a ``principal'' activity (Senate Report, pp. 47, 48), that is, those  which ``are indispensable to the performance of the productive work,''  summarized this provision as it appeared in the Senate Bill by stating:  ``We have clearly eliminated from compensation walking, traveling,  riding, and other activities which are not an integral part of the  employment for which the worker is employer.'' 93 Cong. Rec. 2299. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary (p. 47)  describes the travel affected by the statute as ``Walking, riding, or  traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal  activity or activities within the employer's plant, mine, building, or  other place of employment, irrespective of whether such walking, riding,  or traveling occur on or off the premises of the employer or before or  after the employee has checked in or out.'' The phrase, actual place of  performance,'' as used in section 4(a), thus emphasizes that the  ordinary travel at the beginning and end of the workday to which this  section relates includes the employee's travel on the employer's  premises until he reaches his workbench or other place where he  commences the performance of the principal activity or activities, and  the return travel from that place at the end of the workday. However  where an employee performs his principal activity at various places  (common examples would be a telephone lineman, a ``trouble-shooter'' in  a manufacturing plant, a meter reader, or an exterminator) the travel  between those places is not travel of the nature described in this  section, and the Portal Act has not significance in determining whether  the travel time should be counted as time worked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples of walking, riding, or traveling which may be performed  outside the workday and would normally be considered ``preliminary'' or  ``postliminary'' activities are (1) walking or riding by an employee  between the plant gate and the employee's lathe, workbench or other  actual place of performance of his principal activity or activities; (2)  riding on buses between a town and an outlying mine or factory where the  employee is employed; and (3) riding on buses or trains from a logging  camp to a particular site at which the logging operations are actually  being conducted. \48\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\48\ See Senate Report, p. 47; statements of Senator Donnell, 93  Cong. Rec. 2121, 2182, 3263. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other types of activities which may be performed outside the  workday   and, when performed under the conditions normally present, would be  considered ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activities, include  checking in and out and waiting in line to do so, changing clothes,  washing up or showering, and waiting in line to receive pay checks. \49\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\49\ See Senate Report p. 47. Washing up after work, like the  changing of clothes, may in certain situations be so directly related to  the specific work the employee is employed to perform that it would be  regarded as an integral part of the employee's ``principal activity''.  See colloquy between Senators Cooper and McGrath, 93 Cong. Rec. 2297- 2298. See also paragraph (h) of this section and Sec. 790.8(c). This  does not necessarily mean, however, that travel between the washroom or  clothes-changing place and the actual place of performance of the  specific work the employee is employed to perform, would be excluded  from the type of travel to which section 4(a) refers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> As indicated above, an activity which is a ``preliminary'' or  ``postliminary'' activity under one set of circumstances may be a  principal activity under other conditions. \50\ This may be illustrated  by the following example: Waiting before the time established for the  commencement of work would be regarded as a preliminary activity when  the employee voluntarily arrives at his place of employment earlier than  he is either required or expected to arrive. Where, however, an employee  is required by his employer to report at a particular hour at his  workbench or other place where he performs his principal activity, if  the employee is there at that hour ready and willing to work but for  some reason beyond his control there is no work for him to perform until  some time has elapsed, waiting for work would be an integral part of the  employee's principal activities. \51\ The difference in the two  situations is that in the second the employee was engaged to wait while  in the first the employee waited to be engaged. \52\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\50\ See paragraph (b) of this section. See also footnote 49.</p><p class="depth0">\51\ Colloquy between Senators Cooper and McGrath, 93 Cong. Rec.  2298.</p><p class="depth0">\52\ See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 7 WHR 1165.  [12 FR 7655, Nov. 18, 1947, as amended at 35 FR 7383, May 12, 1970]    Sec. 790.8  ``Principal'' activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employer's liabilities and obligations under the Fair Labor  Standards Act with respect to the ``principal'' activities his employees  are employed to perform are not changed in any way by section 4 of the  Portal Act, and time devoted to such activities must be taken into  account in computing hours worked to the same extent as it would if the  Portal Act had not been enacted. \53\ But before it can be determined  whether an activity is ``preliminary or postliminary to (the) principal  activity or activities'' which the employee is employed to perform, it  is generally necessary to determine what are such ``principal''  activities. \54\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\53\ See Sec. Sec. 790.4 through 790.6 of this bulletin and part  785 of this chapter, which discusses the principles for determining  hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth2">\54\ Although certain ``preliminary'' and ``postliminary''  activities are expressly mentioned in the statute (see Sec. 790.7(b)),  they are described with reference to the place where principal  activities are performed. Even as to these activities, therefore,  identification of certain other activities as ``principal'' activities  is necessary.   The use by Congress of the plural form ``activities'' in the statute  makes it clear that in order for an activity to be a ``principal''  activity, it need not be predominant in some way over all other  activities engaged in by the employee in performing his job; \55\  rather, an employee may, for purposes of the Portal-to-Portal Act be  engaged in several ``principal'' activities during the workday. The  ``principal'' activities referred to in the statute are activities which  the employee is ``employed to perform''; \56\ they do not include  noncompensable ``walking, riding, or traveling'' of the type referred to  in section 4 of the Act. \57\ Several guides to determine what  constitute ``principal activities'' was suggested in the legislative  debates. One of the members of the   conference committee stated to the House of Representatives that ``the  realities of industrial life,'' rather than arbitrary standards, ``are  intended to be applied in defining the term `principal activity or  activities','' and that these words should ``be interpreted with due  regard to generally established compensation practices in the particular  industry and trade.'' \58\ The legislative history further indicates  that Congress intended the words ``principal activities'' to be  construed liberally in the light of the foregoing principles to include  any work of consequence performed for an employer, no matter when the  work is performed. \59\ A majority member of the committee which  introduced this language into the bill explained to the Senate that it  was considered ``sufficiently broad to embrace within its terms such  activities as are indispensable to the performance of productive work.''  \60\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\55\ Cf.

Rec. 2299. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term ``principal activities'' includes all activities which  are an integral part of a principal activity. \61\ Two examples of what  is meant by an integral part of a principal activity are found in the  Report of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate on the Portal-to-Portal  Bill. \62\ They are the following: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\61\ Senate Report, p. 48; statements of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong.

Such activities are an integral  part of the principal activity, and are included within such term.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a garment worker in a textile mill, who is  required to report 30 minutes before other employees report to commence  their principal activities, and who during such 30 minutes distributes  clothing or parts of clothing at the work-benches of other employees and  gets machines in readiness for operation by other employees, such  activities are among the principal activities of such employee.  Such preparatory activities, which the Administrator has always regarded  as work and as compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act, remain so  under the Portal Act, regardless of contrary custom or contract. \63\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\63\ Statement of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2297; colloquy  between Senators Barkley and Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2350. The fact that a  period of 30 minutes was mentioned in the second example given by the  committee does not mean that a different rule would apply where such  preparatory activities take less time to perform. In a colloquy between  Senators McGrath and Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec. 2298, Senator Cooper stated  that ``There was no definite purpose in using the words `30 minutes'  instead of 15 or 10 minutes or 5 minutes or any other number of  minutes.'' In reply to questions, he indicated that any amount of time  spent in preparatory activities of the types referred to in the examples  would be regarded as a part of the employee's principal activity and  within the compensable workday.

Clemens Pottery Co.,  328 U.S. 680, 693. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Among the activities included as an integral part of a principal  activity are those closely related activities which are indispensable to  its performance. \64\ If an employee in a chemical plant, for example,  cannot perform his principal activities without putting on certain  clothes, \65\ changing clothes on the employer's premises at the  beginning and end of the workday would be an integral part of the  employee's principal activity. \66\ On the other hand, if   changing clothes is merely a convenience to the employee and not  directly related to his principal activities, it would be considered as  a ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activity rather than a principal  part of the activity. \67\ However, activities such as checking in and  out and waiting in line to do so would not ordinarily be regarded as  integral parts of the principal activity or activities. \67\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\64\ See statements of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong.

Such a  provision clearly falls within the statutory description. \72\ The  existence or nonexistence of an express provision making an activity  compensable is more difficult to determine in the case of a nonwritten  contract since there may well be conflicting recollections as to the  exact terms of the agreement. The words ``compensable by an express  provision'' indicate that both the intent of the parties to contract  with respect to the activity in question and their intent to provide  compensation for the employee's performance of the activity must  satisfactorily appear from the express terms of the agreement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\72\ See colloquy between Senators Donnell and Lodge, 93 Cong.

If it is so compensable, the relief afforded by section 4  is not available to the employer with respect to such activity, \74\ and  section 4(d) does not operate to exclude the time spent in such activity  from hours worked under the Fair   Labor Standards Act. \75\ Accordingly, in the event that no ``express  provision of a written or nonwritten contract'' makes compensable the  activity in question, it is necessary to determine whether the activity  is made compensable by a custom or practice, not inconsistent with such  a contract, in effect at the establishment or other place where the  employee was employed. \76\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\74\ See Sec. 790.4.</p><p class="depth2">\75\ See Sec. Sec. 790.5 and 790.7.</p><p class="depth2">\76\ See Senate Report, p. 49.</p><p class="depth2">The same is true with respect to the activities referred to in  section 2 of the Portal Act in an action or proceeding relating to  activities performed before May 14, 1947. See Senate Report, p. 45. See  also Sec. 790.23. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The meaning of the word ``compensable'' is the same, for  purposes of the statute, whether a contract or a custom or practice is  involved. \77\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\77\ See Sec. 790.9(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The phrase, ``custom or practice,'' is one which, in common  meaning, is rather broad in scope. The meaning of these words as used in  the Portal Act is not stated in the statute; it must be ascertained from  their context and from other available evidence of the Congressional  intent, with such aid as may be had from the many judicial decisions  interpreting the words ``custom'' and ``practice'' as used in other  connections. Although the legislative history casts little light on the  precise limits of these terms, it is believed that the Congressional  reference to contract, custom or practice was a deliberate use of non- technical words which are commonly understood and broad enough to cover  every normal situation under which an employee works or an employer for  compensation. \78\ Accordingly, ``custom'' and ``practice,'' as used in  section 4(b) of the Portal Act, may be said to be descriptive generally  of those situations where an employer, without being compelled to do so  by an express provision of a contract, has paid employees for certain  activities performed. One of the sponsors of the legislation in the  House of Representatives indicated that the intention was not only ``to  protect every collective bargaining agreement about these activities''  but ``to protect the agreement between one workman and his employer''  and ``every practice or custom which we assume must have entered into  the minds of the people when they made the contract.'' \79\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\78\ See colloquy between Senators Donnell and Tydings, 93 Cong.  Rec. 2125, 2126; colloquy between Senators Donnell, Lodge, and Hawkes,  93 Cong. Rec. 2178, 2179; colloquy between Senators Donnell and Hawkes,  93 Cong. Rec. 2181, 2182. Statements of Senator Cooper, 93 Cong. Rec.  2293.</p><p class="depth2">\79\ Statements of Representative Gwynne, 93 Cong. Rec. 1566. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The words, ``custom or practice,'' as used in the Portal Act, do  not refer to industry custom or the habits of the community which are  familiar to the people; these words are qualified by the phrase ``in  effect * * * at the establishment or other place where such employee was  employed.'' The compensability of an activity under custom or practice,  for purposes of this Act, is tested by the custom or the practice at the  ``particular place of business,'' ``plant,'' ``mine,'' ``factory,''  ``forest,'' etc. \80\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\80\ Senate Report, p. 45; colloquy between Senators Donnell and  Hawkes, 93 Cong. Rec. 2179. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ``The custom or practice'' by which compensability of an  activity is tested under the statute is one ``covering such activity.''  Thus, a custom or practice to pay for washing up in the plant after the  end of the workday, for example, would not necessarily establish the  compensability of walking time thereafter from the washroom in the plant  to the plant gate. It is enough, however, if there is a custom or  practice covering ``such activity''; there is no provision, as there is  with regard to contracts, that the custom or practice be one ``between  such employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative, and  his employer.'' \81\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\81\ See Sec. 790.9(d). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Another qualification of the ``custom or practice'' referred to  in the statute is that it be ``not inconsistent with a written or non- written contract'' of the kind mentioned therein. If the contract is  silent on the question of compensability of the activity, a custom or  practice to pay for it would   not be inconsistent with the contract. \82\ However, the intent of the  provision is that a custom or practice which is inconsistent with the  terms of any such contract shall not be taken into account in  determining whether such an activity is compensable. \83\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\82\ Senate Report, pp. 45, 49; colloquy between Senators Donnell  and Hawkes, 93 Cong.
