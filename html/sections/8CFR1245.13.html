The applicant may submit Form I-765 concurrently with, or subsequent to, the filing of the Form I-485.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application. An applicant for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 who wishes to obtain initial or continued employment authorization during the pendency of the adjustment application must file an Application for Employment authorization (Form I-765), with fee as set forth in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 8 CFR chapter I. The applicant may submit Form I-765 concurrently with, or subsequent to, the filing of the Form I-485.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjudication and issuance. In general, employment authorization may not be issued to an applicant for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 until the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days. However, if Service records contain one or more of the documents specified in section 202(b)(2)(A)(i) through (v) and (vii) of Pub. L. 105-100, evidence of the applicant's Nicaraguan or Cuban nationality, and no indication that the applicant is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the application for employment authorization may be approved, and the resulting document issued immediately upon verification that the Service record contains such information. If the Service fails to adjudicate the application for employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for interim employment authorization in accordance with Sec. 1274a.13(d) of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude an applicant for adjustment of status under Pub. L. 105-100 from being granted an initial employment authorization or an extension of employment authorization under any other provision of law or regulation for which the alien may be eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Parole authorization for purposes of travel--(1) Travel from and return to the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending. If an applicant for benefits under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 desires to travel outside, and return to, the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending, he or she must file a request for advance parole authorization on an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131), with fee as set forth in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 8 CFR chapter I and in accordance with the instructions on the form. If the alien is either in deportation or removal proceedings, or subject to a final order of deportation or removal, the Form I-131 must be submitted to the Assistant Commissioner for International Affairs; otherwise the Form I-131 must be submitted to the director of the Texas Service Center, who shall have jurisdiction over such applications. Unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the United States, and the Service approves such request, his or her application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100 is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Travel from and return to the United States while the application for adjustment of status is pending.

L. 105-100. An otherwise eligible applicant who is outside the United States and wishes to come to the United States in order to apply for benefits under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 may request parole authorization for such purpose by filing an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) with the Texas Service Center, at P.O. Box 851804, Mesquite, TX 75185-1804. Such application must be supported by a photocopy of the Form I-485 that the alien will file once he or she has been paroled into the United States. The applicant must include photocopies of all the supporting documentation listed in paragraph (e) of this section, except the filing fee, the medical report, the fingerprint card, and the local police clearances. If the director of the Texas Service Center is satisfied that the alien will be eligible for adjustment of status once the alien has been paroled into

the United States and files the application, he or she may issue an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512) to allow the alien to travel to, and be paroled into, the United States for a period of 60 days. The applicant shall have 60 days from the date of parole to file the application for adjustment of status. If the alien files the application for adjustment of status within that 60-day period, the Service may re-parole the alien for such time as is necessary for adjudication of the application. Failure to file such application for adjustment of status within 60 days shall result in the alien being returned to the custody of the Service and being examined as an arriving alien applying for admission. Such examination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act, or section 240 of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under any other grounds. Parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in, and the standards prescribed in, section 212(d)(5) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect of departure on an outstanding warrant of exclusion, deportation, or removal. If an alien who is the subject of an outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal departs from the United States, with or without an advance parole authorization, such final order shall be executed by the alien's departure. The execution of such final order shall not preclude the applicant from filing an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission Into the United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I-212) in accordance with Sec. 1212.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Approval. If the director approves the application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the director shall record the alien's lawful admission for permanent resident as of the date of such approval and notify the applicant accordingly. The director shall also advise the alien regarding the delivery of his or her Permanent Resident Card and of the process for obtaining temporary evidence of alien registration. If the alien had previously been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, such order shall be deemed canceled as of the date of the director's approval of the application for adjustment of status. If the alien had been in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings that were administratively closed, such proceedings shall be deemed terminated as of the date of approval of the application for adjustment of status by the director. If an immigration judge grants or if the Board, upon appeal, grants an application for adjustment under the provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence shall be as of the date of such grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Denial and review of decision.

If an alien has been referred to the Immigration Court or has filed an appeal with the Board after an Immigration Court has denied the application for adjustment under NACARA section 202, and proceedings are pending, then the application for adjustment of status will be adjudicated in accordance with section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments. An alien present in the United States subject to a final order of removal after his or her application was denied by an Immigration Court or the Board, but who was made eligible for adjustment pursuant to section 1505(a) of the LIFE Act and its amendments may file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court or the Board, whichever had jurisdiction last. Pursuant to section 1505(a)(2) of the LIFE Act and its amendments, motions to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Court or the Board must be filed on or before June 19, 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Action of immigration judge upon referral of decision by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C)--(1) General.
