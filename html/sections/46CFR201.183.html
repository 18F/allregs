                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for expeditious treatment of matters pending with the Administration are deemed communications on the merits and as such are improper except when forwarded from parties to a proceeding and served upon all other parties thereto. Such communications from parties to a proceeding should be in the form of a motion and are to be dealt with as such by the Administration, the presiding officer, and

the parties to the proceeding. Any such request which is not made as a motion shall be placed in the public correspondence file and will not be considered by the Administration or any of its staff members or the presiding officer in connection with the disposition of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written or oral communications involving any substantive or procedural issue in a matter subject to public hearing directed to a Member of the Administration, its staff, or the presiding officer in the case, from any individual in private or public life shall be deemed a private communication in respect of the merits of the case. These communications, unless otherwise provided for by law or a published rule of the Administration are deemed ex parte communications and are not to be considered part of any record or the basis for any official action by the Administration, members of its staff or the presiding officer: Provided, however, That this prohibition shall not be determined to apply to informal petitions or applications filed with the Administration; the usual informal communications between counsel including discussions directed toward the development of a stipulation or settlement between parties; communications of a nature deemed proper in proceedings in U.S. Federal courts; and communications which merely inquire as to the status of a proceeding without discussing issues or expressing points of view. Any prohibited communications in writing received by a Member of the Administration, its staff or the presiding officer shall be made public by placing it in the correspondence file of the docket which is available for public inspection and will not be considered by the Administration or the presiding officer as part of the record for decision. If the ex parte communication is received orally, a memorandum setting forth the substance of the conversation shall be made and filed in the correspondence section of the appropriate public docket.</p>
