                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, your vehicle family is considered  in compliance with the evaporative emission standards in subpart B of  this part if you prepare an engineering analysis showing that your  vehicles in the family will comply with applicable standards throughout  the useful life, and there are no test results from an emission-data  vehicle representing the family that exceed an emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your evaporative emission family is deemed not to comply if your  engineering analysis is not adequate to show that all the vehicles in  the family will comply with applicable emission standards throughout the  useful life, or if a test result from an emission-data vehicle  representing the family exceeds an emission standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To compare emission levels with emission standards, apply  deterioration factors to the measured emission levels. Establish an  additive deterioration factor based on an engineering analysis that  takes into account the expected aging from in-use vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Apply the deterioration factor to the official emission result,  as described in paragraph (c) of this section, then round the adjusted  figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.  Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each  emission-data vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Your analysis to demonstrate compliance with emission standards  must take into account your design strategy for vehicles that require  testing. Specifically, vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR are presumed to  need the same technologies that are required for heavy-duty vehicles at  or below 14,000 pounds GVWR. Similarly, your analysis to establish a  deterioration factor must take into account your testing to establish  deterioration factors for smaller vehicles.  [79 FR 23750, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
