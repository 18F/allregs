                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a result of mutual agreements, the Commission has, since May 1950 had an arrangement with the Canadian Department of Communications for the exchange of frequency assignment information and engineering comments on proposed assignments along the Canada-United States borders in certain bands above 30 MHz. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this arrangement involves assignments in the following frequency bands.</p><p class="depth2">MHz
30.56-32.0033.00-34.0035.00-36.0037.00-38.0039.00-40.0042.00-46.0047.00-49.6072.00-73.0075.40-76.00150.80-174.00450-470806.00-960.001850.0-2200.02450.0-2690.03700.0-4200.05925.0-7125.0</p><p class="depth2">GHz
10.55-10.6810.70-13.25</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following frequencies are not involved in this arrangement because of the nature of the services:</p><p class="depth2">MHz

N., 120 deg. W., thence along parallel 48 deg. N., to the intersection of 95 deg. W., thence by great circle arc through the southernmost point of Duluth, Minn., thence by great circle arc to 45 deg. N., 85 deg. W., thence southward along meridian 85 deg. W., to its intersection with parallel 41 deg. N., thence along parallel 41 deg. N., to its intersection with meridian 82 deg. W., thence by great circle arc through the southernmost point of Bangor, Maine, thence by great circle arc through the southern-most point of Searsport, Maine, at which point it terminates; and</p><p class="depth2">Line B--Begins at Tofino, B.C., running by great circle arc to the intersection of 50 deg. N., 125 deg. W., thence along parallel 50 deg. N., to the intersection of 90 deg. W., thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 45 deg. N., 79 deg. 30 W., thence by great circle arc through the northernmost point of Drummondville, Quebec (lat: 45 deg. 52 N., long: 72 deg. 30 W.), thence by great circle

arc to 48 deg. 30 N., 70 deg. W., thence by great circle arc through the northernmost point of Campbellton, N.B., thence by great circle arc through the northernmost point of Liverpool, N.S., at which point it terminates.</p><p class="depth2">Line C--Begins at the intersection of 70 deg. N., 144 deg. W., thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 60 deg. N., 143 deg. W., thence by great circle arc so as to include all of the Alaskan Panhandle; and</p><p class="depth2">Line D--Begins at the intersection of 70 deg. N., 138 deg. W., thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 61 deg. 20 N., 139 deg. W., (Burwash Landing), thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 60 deg. 45 N., 135 deg. W., thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 56 deg. N., 128 deg. W., thence south along 128 deg. meridian to Lat. 55 deg. N., thence by great circle arc to the intersection of 54 deg. N., 130 deg. W., thence by great circle arc to Port Clements, thence to the Pacific Ocean where it ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For all stations using bands between 470 MHz and 1000 MHz; and for any station of a terrestrial service using a band above 1000 MHz, the areas which are involved are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a station the antenna of which looks within the 200 deg. sector toward the Canada-United States borders, that area in each country within 35 miles of the borders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a station the antenna of which looks within the 160 deg. sector away from the Canada-United States borders, that area in each country within 5 miles of the borders; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The area in either country within coordination distance as described in Recommendation 1A of the Final Acts of the EARC, Geneva, 1963 of a receiving earth station in the other country which uses the same band.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Proposed assignments in the space radiocommunication services and proposed assignments to stations in frequency bands allocated coequally to space and terrestrial services above 1 GHz are not treated by these arrangements. Such proposed assignments are subject to the regulatory provisions of the International Radio Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Assignments proposed in the frequency band 806-890 MHz shall be in accordance with the Canada-United States agreement, dated April 7, 1982.
