                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If you are a civilian employee of the United States Government or an instrumentality of the United States, your employer will determine the amount of remuneration paid for your work and the periods in or for which such remuneration was paid. We will determine whether your employment is covered under Social Security, the periods of such covered employment, and whether remuneration paid for your work constitutes wages for purposes of Social Security. To make these determinations we will consider the date of your appointment to Federal service, your previous Federal employing agencies and positions (if any), whether you were covered under Social Security or a Federal civilian retirement system, and whether you made a timely election to join a retirement system established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 or the Foreign Service Pension System Act of 1986. Using this information and the following rules, we will determine that your service is covered unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The service would have been excluded if the rules in effect in January 1983 had remained in effect; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You have been continuously performing such service since December 31, 1983; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You are receiving an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or benefits for service as an employee under another retirement system established by a law of the United States and in effect on December 31, 1983, for employees of the Federal Government other than a system for members of the uniformed services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The service is under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 294, relating to the assignment of retired Federal justices and judges to active duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Covered services--(1) Federal officials.
