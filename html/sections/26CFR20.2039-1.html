                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> will not preclude the application of another section of  chapter 11 with regard to that interest. For annuity interests in trust,  see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> applies.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 2039 (a) and (b) applies to the value of an annuity or other  payment receivable by any beneficiary under any form of contract or  agreement entered into after March 3, 1931, under which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An annuity or other payment was payable to the decedent, either  alone or in conjunction with another person or persons, for his life or  for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for  any period which does not in fact end before his death, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The decedent possessed, for his life or for any period not  ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which  does not in fact end before his death, the right to receive such an  annuity or other payment, either alone or in conjunction with another  person or persons.  The term ``annuity or other payment'' as used with respect to both the  decedent and the beneficiary has reference to one or more payments  extending over any period of time. The payments may be equal or unequal,  conditional or uncondititional, periodic or sporadic. The term  ``contract or agreement'' includes any arrangement, understanding or  plan, or any combination of arrangements, understandings or plans  arising by reason of the decedent's employment. An annuity or other  payment ``was payable'' to the decedent if, at the time of his death,  the decedent was in fact receiving an annuity or other payment, whether  or not he had an enforceable right to have payments continued. The  decedent ``possessed the right to receive'' an annuity or other payment  if, immediately before his death, the decedent had an enforceable right  to receive payments at some time in the future, whether or not, at the  time of his death, he had a present right to receive payments. In   connection with the preceding sentence, the decedent will be regarded as  having had ``an enforceable right to receive payments at some time in  the future'' so long as he had complied with his obligations under the  contract or agreement up to the time of his death. For the meaning of  the phrase ``for his life or for any period not ascertainable without  reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end  before his death'', see section 2036 and Sec. 20.2036-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The application of this paragraph is illustrated and more fully  explained in the following examples. In each example: (i) It is assumed  that all transactions occurred after March 3, 1931, and (ii) the amount  stated to be includible in the decedent's gross estate is determined in  accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). The decedent purchased an annuity contract under the  terms of which the issuing company agreed to pay an annuity to the  decedent for his life and, upon his death, to pay a specified lump sum  to his designated beneficiary. The decedent was drawing his annuity at  the time of his death. The amount of the lump sum payment to the  beneficiary is includible in the decedent's gross estate under section  2039 (a) and (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Pursuant to a retirement plan, the employer made  contributions to a fund which was to provide the employee, upon his  retirement at age 60, with an annuity for life, and which was to provide  the employee's wife, upon his death after retirement, with a similar  annuity for life. The benefits under the plan were completely  forfeitable during the employee's life, but upon his death after  retirement, the benefits to the wife were forfeitable only upon her  remarriage. The employee had no right to originally designate or to ever  change the employer's designation of the surviving beneficiary. The  retirement plan at no time met the requirements of section 401(a)  (relating to qualified plans). Assume that the employee died at age 61  after the employer started payment of his annuity as described above.  The value of the wife's annuity is includible in the decedent's gross  estate under section 2039 (a) and (b). Includibility in this case is  based on the fact that the annuity to the decedent ``was payable'' at  the time of his death. The fact that the decedent's annuity was  forfeitable is of no consequence since, at the time of his death, he was  in fact receiving payments under the plan. Nor is it important that the  decedent had no right to choose the surviving beneficiary. The element  of forfeitability in the wife's annuity may be taken into account only  with respect to the valuation of the annuity in the decedent's gross  estate.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). Pursuant to a retirement plan, the employer made  contributions to a fund which was to provide the employee, upon his  retirement at age 60, with an annuity of $100 per month for life, and  which was to provide his designated beneficiary, upon the employee's  death after retirement, with a similar annuity for life. The plan also  provided that (a) upon the employee's separation from service before  retirement, he would have a nonforfeitable right to receive a reduced  annuity starting at age 60, and (b) upon the employee's death before  retirement, a lump sum payment representing the amount of the employer's  contributions credited to the employee's account would be paid to the  designated beneficiary. The plan at no time met the requirements of  section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). Assume that the employee  died at age 49 and that the designated beneficiary was paid the  specified lump sum payment. Such amount is includible in the decedent's  gross estate under section 2039 (a) and (b). Since immediately before  his death, the employee had an enforceable right to receive an annuity  commencing at age 60, he is considered to have ``possessed the right to  receive'' an annuity as that term is used in section 2039 (a). If, in  this example, the employee would not be entitled to any benefits in the  event of his separation from service before retirement for any reason  other than death, the result would be the same so long as the decedent  had complied with his obligations under the contract up to the time of  his death. In such case, he is considered to have had, immediately  before his death, an enforceable right to receive an annuity commencing  at age 60.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). Pursuant to a retirement plan, the employee made  contributions to a fund which was to provide the employee, upon his  retirement at age 60, with an annuity for life, and which was to provide  his designated beneficiary, upon the employee's death after retirement,  with a similar annuity for life. The plan provided, however, that no  benefits were payable in the event of the employee's death before  retirement. The retirement plan at no time met the requirements of  section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). Assume that the employee  died at age 59 but that the employer nevertheless started payment of an  annuity in a slightly reduced amount to the designated beneficiary. The  value of the annuity is not includible in the decedent's gross estate  under section 2039 (a) and (b). Since the employee died before reaching  the retirement age, the employer was under no obligation to pay the  annuity to the employee's designated beneficiary. Therefore, the annuity  was not paid under a ``contract or agreement'' as that term is used in  section 2039 (a). If, however, it can be   established that the employer has consistently paid an annuity under  such circumstances, the annuity will be considered as having been paid  under a ``contract or agreement''.</p><p class="depth0">Example (5). The employer made contributions to a retirement fund  which were credited to the employee's individual account. Under the  plan, the employee was to receive one-half the amount credited to his  account upon his retirement at age 60, and his designated beneficiary  was to receive the other one-half upon the employee's death after  retirement. If the employee should die before reaching the retirement  age, the entire amount credited to his account at such time was to be  paid to the designated beneficiary. The retirement plan at no time met  the requirements of section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). Assume  that the employee received one-half the amount credited to his account  upon reaching the retirement age and that he died shortly thereafter.  Since the employee received all that he was entitled to receive under  the plan before his death, no amount was payable to him for his life or  for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death, or for  any period which did not in fact end before his death. Thus, the amount  of the payment to the designated beneficiary is not includible in the  decedent's gross estate under section 2039 (a) and (b). If, in this  example, the employee died before reaching the retirement age, the  amount of the payment to the designated beneficiary would be includible  in the decedent's gross estate under section 2039 (a) and (b). In this  latter case, the decedent possessed the right to receive lump sum  payment for a period which did not in fact end before his death.</p><p class="depth0">Example (6). The employer made contributions to two different funds  set up under two different plans. One plan was to provide the employee  upon his retirement at age 60, with an annuity for life, and the other  plan was to provide the employee's designated beneficiary, upon the  employee's death, with a similar annuity for life. Each plan was  established at a different time and each plan was administered  separately in every respect. Neither plan at any time met the  requirements of section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). The value  of the designated beneficiary's annuity is includible in the employee's  gross estate. All rights and benefits accruing to an employee and to  others by reason of the employment (except rights and benefits accruing  under certain plans meeting the requirements of section 401(a) (see  Sec. 20.2039-2)) are considered together in determining whether or not  section 2039 (a) and (b) applies. The scope of section 2039 (a) and (b)  cannot be limited by indirection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount includible in the gross estate. The amount to be included  in a decedent's gross estate under section 2039 (a) and (b) is an amount  which bears the same ratio to the value at the decedent's death of the  annuity or other payment receivable by the beneficiary as the  contribution made by the decedent, or made by his employer (or former  employer) for any reason connected with his employment, to the cost of  the contract or agreement bears to its total cost. In applying this  ratio, the value at the decedent's death of the annuity or other payment  is determined in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. Sec.  20.2031-1, 20.2031-7, 20.2031-8, and 20.2031-9. The application of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). On January 1, 1945, the decedent and his wife each  contributed $15,000 to the purchase price of an annuity contract under  the terms of which the issuing company agreed to pay an annuity to the  decedent and his wife for their joint lives and to continue the annuity  to the survivor for his life. Assume that the value of the survivor's  annuity at the decedent's death (computed under Sec. 20.2031-8) is  $20,000. Since the decedent contributed one-half of the cost of the  contract, the amount to be included in his gross estate under section  2039 (a) and (b) is $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). Under the terms of an employment contract entered into  on January 1, 1945, the employer and the employee made contributions to  a fund which was to provide the employee, upon his retirement at age 60,  with an annuity for life, and which was to provide his designated  beneficiary, upon the employee's death after retirement, with a similar  annuity for life. The retirement fund at no time formed part of a plan  meeting the requirements of section 401(a) (relating to qualified  plans). Assume that the employer and the employee each contributed  $5,000 to the retirement fund. Assume further, that the employee died  after retirement at which time the value of the survivor's annuity was  $8,000. Since the employer's contributions were made by reason of the  decedent's employment, the amount to be included in his gross estate  under section 2039 (a) and (b) is the entire $8,000. If, in the above  example, only the employer made contributions to the fund, the amount to  be included in the gross estate would still be $8,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insurance under policies on the life of the decedent. If an  annuity or other payment receivable by a beneficiary under a contract or  agreement is in substance the proceeds of insurance   under a policy on the life of the decedent, section 2039 (a) and (b)  does not apply. For the extent to which such an annuity or other payment  is includable in a decedent's gross estate, see section 2042 and Sec.  20.2042-1. A combination annuity contract and life insurance policy on  the decedent's life (e.g., a ``retirement income'' policy with death  benefits) which matured during the decedent's lifetime so that there was  no longer an insurance element under the contract at the time of the  decedent's death is subject to the provisions of section 2039 (a) and  (b). On the other hand, the treatment of a combination annuity contract  and life insurance policy on the decedent's life which did not mature  during the decedent's lifetime depends upon the nature of the contract  at the time of the decedent's death. The nature of the contract is  generally determined by the relation of the reserve value of the policy  to the value of the death benefit at the time of the decedent's death.  If the decedent dies before the reserve value equals the death benefit,  there is still an insurance element under the contract. The contract is  therefore considered, for estate tax purposes, to be an insurance policy  subject to the provisions of section 2042. However, if the decedent dies  after the reserve value equals the death benefit, there is no longer an  insurance element under the contract. The contract is therefore  considered to be a contract for an annuity or other payment subject to  the provisions of section 2039 (a) and (b) or some other section of Part  III of Subchapter A of Chapter 11. Notwithstanding the relation of the  reserve value to the value of the death benefit, a contract under which  the death benefit could never exceed the total premiums paid, plus  interest, contains no insurance element.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Pursuant to a retirement plan established January 1, 1945,  the employer purchased a contract from an insurance company which was to  provide the employee, upon his retirement at age 65, with an annuity of  $100 per month for life, and which was to provide his designated  beneficiary, upon the employee's death after retirement, with a similar  annuity for life. The contract further provided that if the employee  should die before reaching the retirement age, a lump sum payment of  $20,000 would be paid to his designated beneficiary in lieu of the  annuity described above. The plan at no time met the requirements of  section 401(a) (relating to qualified plans). Assume that the reserve  value of the contract at the retirement age would be $20,000. If the  employee died after reaching the retirement age, the death benefit to  the designated beneficiary would constitute an annuity, the value of  which would be includable in the employee's gross estate under section  2039 (a) and (b). If, on the other hand, the employee died before  reaching his retirement age, the death benefit to the designated  beneficiary would constitute insurance under a policy on the life of the  decedent since the reserve value would be less than the death benefit.  Accordingly, its includability would depend upon section 2042 and Sec.  20.2042-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> as ``trusts''): Certain  charitable remainder trusts (collectively CRTs) such as a charitable  remainder annuity trust (CRAT) within the meaning of section 664(d)(1),  a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT) within the meaning of section  664(d)(2) or (d)(3), and any other charitable remainder trust that does  not qualify under section 664(d), whether because the CRT was created  prior to 1969, there was a defect in the drafting of the CRT, there was  no intention to qualify the CRT for the charitable deduction, or  otherwise; other trusts established by a grantor (collectively GRTs)  such as a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) paying out a qualified  annuity interest within the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-3(b) of this  chapter, a grantor retained unitrust (GRUT) paying out a qualified  unitrust interest within the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-3(c) of this  chapter; and various forms of grantor retained income trusts (GRITs)  whether or not the grantor's retained interest is a qualified interest  as defined in section 2702(b), including without limitation a qualified  personal residence trust (QPRT) within the meaning of Sec. 25.2702-   5(c) of this chapter and a personal residence trust (PRT) within the  meaning of Sec. 25.2702-5(b) of this chapter. For purposes of  determining the extent to which a retained interest causes all or a  portion of a trust to be included in a decedent's gross estate, see  Sec. 20.2036-1(c)(1), (2), and (3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability dates. The first, second, and fourth  sentences in paragraph (a) of this section are applicable to the estates  of decedents dying after August 16, 1954. The fifth sentence of  paragraph (a) of this section is applicable to the estates of decedents  dying on or after October 27, 1972, and to the estates of decedents for  which the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of an estate  tax overpayment ends on or after October 27, 1972. The third, sixth, and  seventh sentences of paragraph (a) of this section and all of paragraph  (e) of this section are applicable to the estates of decedents dying on  or after July 14, 2008.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 7416, 41 FR 14514, Apr. 6, 1976; T.D. 9414, 73 FR 40178,  July 14, 2008]    Sec. 20.2039-1T  Limitations and repeal of estate tax exclusion for  qualified plans and individual retirement plans (IRAs) (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: Are there any exceptions to the general effective dates of the  $100,000 limitation and the repeal of the estate tax exclusion for the  value of interests under qualified plans and IRAs described in section  2039 (c) and (e)?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Yes. Section 245 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) limited the estate tax exclusion to  $100,000 for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1982. Section  525 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA of 1984) repealed the exclusion  for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em> of the TRA of 1984 amended section 245 of  TEFRA to provide that the $100,000 limitation on the exclusion for the  value of a decedent's interest in a plan or IRA will not apply to the  estate of any decedent dying after December 31, 1982, to the extent that  the decedent-participant was in pay status on December 31, 1982, with  respect to such interest and irrevocably elected the form of benefit  payable under the plan or IRA (including the form of any survivor  benefits) with respect to such interest before January 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Similarly, the TRA of 1984 provides that the repeal of the  estate tax exclusion for the value of a decedent's interest in a plan or  IRA will not apply to the estate of a decedent dying after December 31,  1984, to the extent that the decedent-participant was in pay status on  December 31, 1984, with respect to such interest and irrevocably elected  the form of benefit payable under the plan or IRA (including the form of  any survivor benefits) with respect to such interest before July 18,  1984.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What is the meaning of ``in pay status'' on the applicable  date?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: A participant was in pay status on the applicable date with  respect to a portion of his or her interest in a plan or IRA if such  portion is to be paid in a benefit form that has been elected on or  before such date and the participant has received, on or before such  date, at least one payment under such benefit form.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: What is required for an election of the form of benefit payable  under the plan to have been irrevocable as of any applicable date?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: As of any applicable date, an election of the form of benefit  payable under a plan is irrevocable if, as of such date, it was a  written irrevocable election that, with respect to all payments to be  received after such date, specified the form of distribution (e.g., lump  sum, level dollar annuity, formula annuity) and the period over which  the distribution would be made (e.g., single life, joint and survivor,  term certain). An election is not irrevocable as of any applicable date  if, on or after such date, the form or period of the distribution could  be determined or altered by any person or persons. An election does not  fail to be irrevocable as of an applicable date merely because the  beneficiaries were not designated as of such date or could be changed  after such date. If any interest in any IRA may not, by law or contract,  be subject to an irrevocable election described in this section, any  election of the form of benefit payable under the   IRA does not satisfy the requirement that an irrevocable election have  been made.
