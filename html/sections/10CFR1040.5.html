Information on requirements of this part, complaint procedures and the rights of beneficiaries are to be included in handbooks, manuals, pamphlets, and other materials which are ordinarily distributed to the public to describe the federally assisted programs or activities and the requirements for participation by recipients and beneficiaries. To the extent that

This requirement applies to written material of the type which is ordinarily distributed to the public. The Department may require a recipient to take additional steps to carry out the intent of this subsection.
