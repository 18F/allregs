                            <p class="depth0">The Chief Executive Officer may request that funds due and payable to you by another Federal agency instead be paid to the Corporation to satisfy a debt you owe to the Corporation. The Corporation will refer debts to the Treasury for centralized administrative offset in accordance with the FCCS and the procedures established by the Treasury. Where centralized offset is not available or appropriate, the Corporation may request offset directly from the Federal agency that is holding funds for you. In requesting administrative offset, the Corporation will certify in writing to the Federal agency that is holding funds for you:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> That you owe the debt;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount and basis of the debt; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> That the Corporation has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations in this subpart, the applicable administrative offset regulations of the agency holding the funds, and the applicable provisions of the FCCS with respect to providing you with due process.</p>
