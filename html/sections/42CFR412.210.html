                                Sec. 412.210  Puerto Rico rates for Federal fiscal years 1989
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS determines the Puerto Rico adjusted  prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each  inpatient hospital discharge occurring in Federal fiscal years 1989  through 2003 that involves inpatient hospital services of a hospital in  Puerto Rico subject to the prospective payment system for which payment  may be made under Medicare Part A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate is determined for hospitals located in large urban,  other urban, or rural areas within Puerto Rico, as described in  paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Geographic classifications. (1) For purposes of this section,  the definitions set forth in Sec. 412.208(f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, a hospital  located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed  to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount  for the urban area to which the greatest number of workers in the county  commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an  urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs if the commuting  rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis  of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if  applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central  counties of all adjacent MSAs.  These EOMB standards are set forth in the notice of final standards for  classification of MSAs published in the Federal Register on January 3,  1980 (45 FR 956), and available from CMS, East High Rise Building, Room  132, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, for  hospitals that consist of two or more separately located inpatient  hospital facilities, the national adjusted prospective payment rate for  inpatient operating costs is based on the geographic location of the  hospital at which the discharge occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Updating previous standardized amounts. CMS computes separate  average standardized amounts for hospitals in large urban, other urban,  and rural areas within Puerto Rico equal to the respective average  standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1988 under Sec.  412.208(e)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increased by the applicable percentage changes determined under  Sec. 412.63 (g) and (h); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reduced by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by  CMS) of the total amount of prospective payments that are additional  payment amounts to hospitals located in Puerto Rico attributable to  outlier cases under subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Computing Puerto Rico rates for large urban, other urban, and  rural hospitals. For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS  establishes for the fiscal year a Puerto Rico prospective payment rate  for inpatient operating costs as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For hospitals located in a large urban or other urban area in  Puerto Rico, the rate equals the product of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average standardized amount (computed under paragraph (c) of  this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in a large urban  or other urban area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The weighting factor determined under Sec. 412.60(b) for that  DRG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For hospitals located in a rural area in Puerto Rico, the rate  equals the product of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average standardized amount (computed under paragraph (c) of  this section) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in a rural area;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The weighting factor (determined under Sec. 412.60(b)) for  that DRG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjusting for different area wage levels. CMS adjusts the  proportion (as estimated by CMS from time to time) of Puerto Rico rates  computed under paragraph (d) of this section that is attributable to  wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage  levels by a factor (established by CMS) reflecting the relative hospital  wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as  determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the  hospital compared to the Peurto Rico average hospital wage level.
