                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(e), VA is  authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting  opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and  economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to  negotiated procurements. FAR 19.202-1 provides additional guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Costs incurred by a mentor to provide developmental assistance,  as described in 819.7110 to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s) with  a Protege firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a VA  contract. If VA is the mentor's responsible audit agency under FAR  42.703-1, VA will consider these costs in determining indirect cost  rates. If VA is not the responsible audit agency, mentors are encouraged  to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency  on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to subparagraph (b) of this section, contracting  officers shall give mentors evaluation credit under 852.219-52,  Evaluation Factor for Participation in the VA Mentor-Protege Program,  considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protege  Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans  containing mentor-Protege arrangements more favorably than  subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protege Agreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(v)</em> and  determining contractor responsibility 19.705-5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented  annually to the mentoring firm providing the most effective  developmental support to a Protege. The Mentor-Protege Program Manager  will recommend an award winner to the OSDBU Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> OSDBU Mentor-Protege Annual Conference. At the conclusion of  each year in the Mentor-Protege Program, mentor firms will be invited to  brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other  guests on program progress.</p>
