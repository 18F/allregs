                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractor labor policies and compensation practices, whether or  not included in labor-management agreements, are not acceptable bases  for allowing costs in cost-reimbursement contracts or for recognition of  costs in pricing fixed-price contracts if they result in unreasonable  costs to the Government. For a discussion of allowable costs resulting  from labor-management agreements, see 31.205-6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Labor disputes may cause work stoppages that delay the  performance of Government contracts. Contracting officers shall impress  upon contractors that each contractor shall be held accountable for  reasonably avoidable delays. Standard contract clauses dealing with  default, excusable delays, etc., do not relieve contractors or  subcontractors from the responsibility for delays that are within the  contractors' or their subcontractors' control. A delay caused by a  strike that the contractor or subcontractor could not reasonably prevent  can be excused; however, it cannot be excused beyond the point at which  a reasonably diligent contractor or subcontractor could have acted to  end the strike by actions such as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing a charge with the National Labor Relations Board to  permit the Board to seek injunctive relief in court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Using other available Government procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Using private boards or organizations to settle disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Strikes normally result in changing patterns of cost incurrence  and therefore may have an impact on the allowability of costs for cost- reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing fixed- price contracts. Certain costs may increase because of strikes; e.g.,  guard services and attorney's fees. Other costs incurred during a strike  may not fluctuate (e.g., fixed costs such as rent and depreciation), but  because of reduced production, their proportion of the unit cost of  items produced increases. All costs incurred during strikes shall be  carefully examined to ensure recognition of only those costs necessary  for performing the contract in accordance with the Government's  essential interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If during a labor dispute, the inspectors' safety is not  endangered, the normal functions of inspection at the plant of a  Government contractor shall be continued without regard to the existence  of a labor dispute, strike, or picket line.
