                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in the rules of this part, all filings that contain information for which confidential treatment is sought or information previously designated as confidential pursuant to Sec. Sec. 502.13, 502.167, 502.201(j)(1)(vii), or any other rules of this part, or for which a request for protective order pursuant to Sec. 502.201(j) is pending, are subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Two versions of filings. Two versions of documents must be filed if a document:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contains information previously designated by the Commission or presiding officer as confidential; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contains information for which confidential treatment is sought. Except as specified below, both versions must be filed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 502.2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Confidential version. The confidential filing must include a cover page marked ``Confidential-Restricted.'' The specific confidential information must be conspicuously and clearly marked on each page, for example by highlighting or bracing. If confidentiality will end on a date certain or upon the occurrence of an event, this must be stated on the cover, e.g., ``CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL [DATE],'' or ``CONFIDENTIAL DURING JUDICIAL REVIEW.'' The confidential version of a document may be provided to the presiding officer by email but should not be filed with the Office of the Secretary by email.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public version. Within three business days of filing a confidential version of a filing, a public version must be filed. The public version must indicate on the cover page and on each affected page ``Public Version--confidential materials excluded.'' The public version must clearly indicate any information withheld, for example with blackout or braces, and its pagination and depiction of text on each page must be identical to that of the confidential version. For example, the confidential filing may read: ``On January 1, 2005, complainant entered into a {25{time}  year lease with respondent for a monthly rent of {$1,000{time} .'' The public version would read: ``On January 1, 2005, complainant entered into a { {time}  year lease with respondent for a monthly rent of { {time} .'' Public versions of confidential filings may be filed with the Secretary and presiding officer by email.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exhibits. Confidential information in exhibits should be marked as specified above. If marking within the text is not feasible, individual pages may be replaced in the public version with a page indicating that confidential material is excluded. Entire exhibits should not be excluded, only those pages containing confidential material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion for confidential treatment. If confidentiality is sought for a filing containing information not previously designated as confidential by the Commission or presiding officer, the confidential filing must be accompanied by a motion justifying confidential treatment. This motion must identify the specific information in a document for which protection is sought and show good cause by demonstrating that the information is a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information pursuant to Sec. 502.201(j)(1)(vii). The burden is on the party that wants to protect the information to show good cause for its protection. A motion is not required for information, including personal privacy and financial account numbers, redacted pursuant to Sec. 502.13, Privacy protection for filings made with the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of confidential information. Confidential treatment afforded by this section is subject to the proviso that any information designated as confidential may be used by the administrative law judge or the Commission if deemed necessary to a decision in the proceeding. [Rule 5.]
