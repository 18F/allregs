                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Qualified timber property. The term qualified timber property  means property located in the United States which will contain trees in  significant commercial quantities. The property may be a woodlot or  other site but must consist of at least one acre which is planted with  tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or  reforestation. The property must be held by the taxpayer for the growing  and cutting of timber which will either be sold for use in, or used by  the taxpayer in, the commercial production of timber products. A  taxpayer does not have to own the property in order to be eligible to  elect to amortize costs attributable to it under section 194. Thus, a  taxpayer may elect to amortize qualifying reforestation expenditures  incurred by such taxpayer on leased qualified timber property. Qualified  timber property does not include property on which the taxpayer has  planted shelter belts (for which current deductions are allowed under  section 175) or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amortizable basis. The term amortizable basis means that portion  of the basis of qualified timber property which is attributable to  reforestation expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reforestation expenditures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term  reforestation expenditures means direct costs incurred to plant or seed  for forestation or reforestation purposes. Qualifying expenditures  include amounts spent for site preparation, seed or seedlings, and labor  and tool costs, including depreciation on equipment used in planting or  seeding. Only those costs which must be capitalized and are included in  the adjusted basis of the property qualify as reforestation  expenditures. Costs which are currently deductible do not qualify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost-sharing programs. Any expenditures for which the taxpayer  has been reimbursed under any governmental reforestation cost-sharing  program do not qualify as reforestation expenditures unless the amounts  reimbursed have been included in the gross income of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions of controlled group of corporations and component  member of controlled group. For purposes of section 194, the terms  controlled group of corporations and component member of a controlled  group of corporations shall have the same meaning assigned to   those terms in section 1563 (a) and (b), except that the phrase ``more  than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for the phrase ``at least 80  percent'' each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1).
