Tariff classification rulings which do not involve the application of the NAFTA shall be issued under part 177 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Issues involving a change in tariff classification of a material. Where the request for the advance ruling involves the application of a rule of origin that requires an assessment of whether materials used in the production of an imported good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, the request must list each material used in the production of the good and must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify each material which is claimed to be an originating material and provide a complete description of each such material, including the basis for the claim as to originating status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify each material which is a non-originating material, or for which the origin is unknown, and provide a complete description of each such material, including its tariff classification if known; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Describe all processing operations employed in the production of the good, the location of each operation and the sequence in which the operations occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NAFTA rulings on regional value content. NAFTA advance ruling requests, if involving the issue of whether a good satisfies a regional value content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method, or under both methods, as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, must specify each method under which eligibility is sought. Where the transaction value method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: information sufficient to calculate the transaction value of the good in accordance with schedule II of the appendix to this part with respect to the transaction of the producer of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used by the producer in the production of the good in accordance with the provisions of section 7 and, where applicable, section 6(10) of the appendix to this part; a complete description of each material that is claimed to be an originating material and that is used in the production of the good, including the basis for the claim as to originating status; information sufficient to permit an examination of the factors enumerated in schedule III or VIII of the appendix to this part where the advance ruling request involves an issue of whether, with respect to the good or material under the applicable schedule, the transaction value is acceptable; and information sufficient for any other circumstance to make any determination relevant to the application of the regional value content requirement to the good. Where the net cost method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate value of any

cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> NAFTA rulings on producer materials. W here the advance ruling request involves an issue with respect to an intermediate material under Article 402(10) of the NAFTA (see section 7(4) of the appendix to this part), the request must contain sufficient information to determine the origin and value of the material in accordance with Article 402(11) of the NAFTA (see section 7(6) of the appendix to this part). Where the advance ruling request is submitted by a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material under Sec. 181.92(b)(5)(iii) of this part and concerns only the origin of such material, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only include the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), including any information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; any information in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; a sample as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) if relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; and the information in paragraph (b)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Samples. Each request for an advance ruling should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the CBP file in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Related documents. If the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the advance ruling request become a part of the CBP file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the advance ruling request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prior or current transactions--(i) General. Each request for an advance ruling must state:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Each request for an advance ruling must state:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction or issue, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any CBP office;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issue involved has ever been, or is currently, the subject of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom, or review by a judicial or quasi-judicial body in Canada or Mexico;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A verification of origin performed in the United States, Canada or Mexico;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An administrative appeal in the United States, Canada or Mexico; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A request for an advance ruling under this subpart, or a request for an advance ruling in Canada or Mexico

under an appropriate authority referred to in Sec. 181.76(e)(1) of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The status or disposition of any matter on which an affirmative statement is made under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Whether the transaction described in the advance ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in status of transaction. If a prospective transaction which is the subject of an advance ruling request becomes a current transaction, the person who submitted the request shall so notify the office processing the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Statement of position. If the request for an advance ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the advance ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Privileged or confidential information. Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be identified clearly, and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be set forth. An advance ruling will not be issued until all trade secret, privilege or confidentiality issues are resolved (see Sec. 181.99(a)(3) of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Signing; instruction as to reply. The request for an advance ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in Sec. 181.92(b)(5) of this part. An advance ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the advance ruling letter be addressed to the other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requests for immediate consideration. CBP will normally process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible, as specified in Sec. 181.99 of this part. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.
