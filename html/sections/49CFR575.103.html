                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section requires manufacturers of slide-in campers to affix to each camper a label that contains information relating to identification and proper loading of the camper and to provide more detailed loading information in the owner's manual. This section also requires manufacturers of trucks that would accommodate slide-in campers to specify the cargo weight ratings and the longitudinal limits within which the center of gravity for the cargo weight rating should be located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide information that can be used to reduce overloading and improper load placement in truck-camper combinations and unsafe truck- camper matching in order to prevent accidents resulting from the adverse effects of these conditions on vehicle steering and braking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. This section applies to slide-in campers and to trucks that are capable of accommodating slide- in campers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2">Camper means a structure designed to be mounted in the cargo area of a truck, or attached to an incomplete vehicle with motive power, for the purpose of providing shelter for persons.</p><p class="depth2">Cargo Weight Rating means the value specified by the manufacturer as the cargo-carrying capacity, in pounds or kilograms, of a vehicle, exclusive of the weight of occupants in designated

seating positions, computed as 68 kilograms or 150 pounds times the number of designated seating positions.</p><p class="depth2">Slide-in Camper means a camper having a roof, floor, and sides, designed to be mounted on and removable from the cargo area of a truck by the user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements--(1) Slide-in Camper--(i) Labels. Each slide-in camper shall have permanently affixed to it, in such a manner that it cannot be removed without defacing or destroying it, and in a plainly visible location on an exterior rear surface other than the roof, steps, or bumper extension, a label containing the following information in the English language lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than 2.4 millimeters (three thirty-seconds of an inch) high, of a color contrasting with the background, in the order shown below and in the form illustrated in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Slide-in Camper--(i) Labels. Each slide-in camper shall have permanently affixed to it, in such a manner that it cannot be removed without defacing or destroying it, and in a plainly visible location on an exterior rear surface other than the roof, steps, or bumper extension, a label containing the following information in the English language lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than 2.4 millimeters (three thirty-seconds of an inch) high, of a color contrasting with the background, in the order shown below and in the form illustrated in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Labels. Each slide-in camper shall have permanently affixed to it, in such a manner that it cannot be removed without defacing or destroying it, and in a plainly visible location on an exterior rear surface other than the roof, steps, or bumper extension, a label containing the following information in the English language lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than 2.4 millimeters (three thirty-seconds of an inch) high, of a color contrasting with the background, in the order shown below and in the form illustrated in Figure 1.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Name of camper manufacturer. The full corporate or individual name of the actual assembler of the camper shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as ``Co.'' or ``Inc.'' and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals may be used. The name of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words ``Manufactured by'' or ``Mfd by.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Month and year of manufacture. It may be spelled out, such as ``June 1995'' or expressed in numerals, such as ``695.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The following statement completed as appropriate:</p><p class="depth5">``Camper weight is ______ kg. (______ lbs.) maximum when it contains standard equipment, ______ liters (______ gal.) of water, ______ kg. (______ lbs.) of bottled gas, and ______ cubic meters (______ cubic ft.) refrigerator (or icebox with ______ kg. (______ lbs.) of ice, as applicable). Consult owner's manual (or data sheet, as applicable) for weights of additional or optional equipment.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> ``Liters (or gal.) of water'' refers to the volume of water necessary to fill the camper's fresh water tanks to capacity. ``Kg. (or lbs.) of bottled gas'' refers to the amount of gas necessary to fill the camper's bottled gas tanks to capacity. The statement regarding a ``refrigerator'' or ``icebox'' refers to the capacity of the refrigerator with which the vehicle is equipped or the weight of the ice with which the icebox may be filled. Any of these items may be omitted from the statement if the corresponding accessories are not included with the camper, provided that the omission is noted in the camper owner's manual as required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Owner's manual. Each slide-in camper manufacturer shall provide with each camper a manual or other document containing the information specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The statement and information provided on the label as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. Instead of the information required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, a manufacturer may use the statements ``See camper identification label located (as applicable) for month and year of manufacture.'' If water, bottled gas, or refrigerator (icebox) has been omitted from this statement, the manufacturer's information shall note such omission and advise that the weight of any such item when added to the camper should be added to the maximum camper weight figure used in selecting an appropriate truck.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A list of other additional or optional equipment that the camper is designed to carry, and the maximum weight of each if its weight is more than 9 kg. (20 lbs) when installed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The statement: ``To estimate the total cargo load that will be placed on a truck, add the weight of all passengers in the camper, the weight of supplies, tools, and all other cargo, the weight of installed additional or optional camper equipment, and the manufacturer's camper weight figure. Select a truck that has a cargo weight rating that is equal to or greater than the total cargo load of the camper and whose manufacturer recommends a cargo center of gravity zone that will contain the camper's center of gravity when it is installed.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The statements: ``When loading this camper, store heavy gear first, keeping it on or close to the camper floor. Place heavy things far enough forward to keep the loaded camper's

center of gravity within the zone recommended by the truck manufacturer. Store only light objects on high shelves. Distribute weight to obtain even side-to-side balance of the loaded vehicle. Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck-camper is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. The load on an axle should not exceed its gross axle weight rating (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). These weight ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is located on the left side of the vehicle, normally on the dash panel, hinge pillar, door latch post, or door edge next to the driver on trucks manufactured on or after January 1, 1972. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A picture showing the location of the longitudinal center of gravity of the camper within an accuracy of 5 centimeters (2 inches) under the loaded condition specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(D) of this section in the manner illustrated in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trucks. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, each manufacturer of a truck that is capable of accommodating a slide-in camper shall provide to the purchaser in the owner's manual or other document delivered with the truck, in writing and in the English language, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) (A) through (E) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, each manufacturer of a truck that is capable of accommodating a slide-in camper shall provide to the purchaser in the owner's manual or other document delivered with the truck, in writing and in the English language, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) (A) through (E) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A picture showing the manufacturer's recommended longitudinal center of gravity zone for the cargo weight rating in the form illustrated in Figure 4. The boundaries of the zone shall be such that when a slide-in camper equal in weight to the truck's cargo weight rating is installed, no GAWR of the truck is exceeded.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The truck's cargo weight rating.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The statements: ``When the truck is used to carry a slide-in camper, the total cargo load of the truck consists of the manufacturer's camper weight figure, the weight of installed additional camper equipment not included in the manufacturer's camper weight figure, the weight of camper cargo, and the weight of passengers in the camper. The total cargo load should not exceed the truck's cargo weight rating and the camper's center of gravity should fall within the truck's recommended center of gravity zone when installed.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The statements: ``Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck camper is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. Individual axle loads should not exceed either of the gross axle weight ratings (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). These ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is located on the left side of the vehicle, normally the dash, hinge pillar, door latch post, or door edge next to the driver. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a truck would accommodate a slide-in camper but the manufacturer of the truck recommends that the truck not be used for that purpose, the information specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section shall not be provided but instead the manufacturer shall provide a statement that the truck should not be used to carry a slide-in camper.</p><p class="depth4">MFD.
