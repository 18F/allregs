                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The application shall be in writing in the form of a letter,  must include any supporting documents necessary to make the application  complete, and otherwise must comply with Sec. 240.0-3. All applications  must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission.  Requestors may seek confidential treatment of their applications to the  extent provided under Sec. 200.81 of this chapter. If an application is  incomplete, the Commission, through the Division handling the  application, may request that the application be withdrawn unless the  applicant can justify, based on all the facts and circumstances, why  supporting materials have not been submitted and undertakes to submit  the omitted materials promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An applicant may submit a request electronically. The electronic  mailbox to use for these applications is described on the Commission's  Web site at http://www.sec.gov in the ``Exchange Act Exemptive  Applications'' section. In the event the electronic mailbox is revised  in the future, applicants can find the appropriate mailbox by accessing  the ``Electronic Mailboxes at the Commission'' section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant also may submit a request in paper format. Five  copies of every paper application and every amendment to such an  application must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary at 100 F  Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applications must be on white  paper no larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches in size. The left margin of  applications must be at least 1\1/2\ inches wide, and if the application  is bound, it must be bound on the left side. All typewritten or printed  material must be on one side of the paper only and must be set forth in  black ink so as to permit photocopying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Every application (electronic or paper) must contain the name,  address and telephone number of each applicant and the name, address,  and telephone number of a person to whom any questions regarding the  application should be directed. The Commission will not consider  hypothetical or anonymous requests for exemptive relief. Each applicant  shall state the basis for the relief sought, and identify the  anticipated benefits for investors and any conditions or limitations the  applicant believes would be appropriate for the protection of investors.  Applicants should also cite to and discuss applicable precedent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendments to the application should be prepared and submitted  as set forth in these procedures and should be marked to show what  changes have been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After the filing is complete, the applicable Division will  review the application. Once all questions and issues have been answered  to the satisfaction of the Division, the staff will make an appropriate  recommendation to the Commission. After consideration of the  recommendation by the Commission, the Commission's Office of the  Secretary will issue an appropriate response and will notify the  applicant. If the application pertains to a section of the Exchange Act  pursuant to which the Commission has delegated its authority to the  appropriate Division, the Division Director or his or her designee will  issue an appropriate response and notify the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commission, in its sole discretion, may choose to publish in  the Federal Register a notice that the application has been submitted.  The notice would provide that any person may, within the period  specified therein, submit to the Commission any information that relates  to the Commission action requested in the application. The notice also  would indicate the earliest date on which the Commission would take  final action on the application, but in no event would such action be  taken earlier than 25 days following publication of the notice in the  Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Commission may, in its sole discretion, schedule a hearing  on the matter addressed by the application.  [63 FR 8102, Feb. 18. 1998, as amended at 73 FR 973, Jan. 4, 2008; 76 FR  43891, July 22, 2011]</p>
