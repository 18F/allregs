                                Sec. 24.135  Wine premises alternation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The proprietor of a bonded winery or bonded wine cellar may alternate all or a portion of wine premises for use as a taxpaid wine bottling house or use as taxpaid wine premises. The proprietor may also alternate the use of adjacent or contiguous premises qualified under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 (distilled spirits plant, brewery, etc.) for use as wine premises or vice versa. If a proprietor of a bonded wine cellar or winery wishes to use all or a portion of such premises alternately as a volatile fruit-flavor concentrate plant or vice-a-versa, the proprietor must comply with the requirements of Secs. 18.40 through 18.43 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying documents. Where the proprietor desires to alternate bonded wine premises as taxpaid wine bottling house premises or taxpaid wine premises, or other premises qualified under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, the following qualifying documents will be filed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement on the application TTB F 5120.25 that an alternation of wine premises will occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of existing bond, consent of surety, or a new bond covering the alternation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of how taxpaid wine or spirits, or untaxpaid wine or spirits will be identified and segregated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other document or additional information the appropriate TTB officer may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternation. After the necessary qualifying documents have been approved by the appropriate TTB officer, the proprietor may alternate wine premises as described in the application. Any portion of wine premises on which taxpaid wine is located will be considered taxpaid wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house premises and any portion of the premises on which wine not identified as taxpaid is located will be considered bonded wine premises. The proprietor shall, prior to the initial alternation of the premises, identify by portable signs or tags, or by any other method or manner satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer, either all taxpaid wine on taxpaid wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house premises or all untaxpaid wine on bonded wine premises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Segregation. The proprietor shall keep untaxpaid wine or spirits physically separated from taxpaid wine or spirits and on the designated premises. This separation will be by use of tanks, rooms, buildings, partitions, pallet stacks, or complete physical separation, or by any other method or manner which will clearly and readily distinguish untaxpaid wine or spirits from taxpaid wine or spirits and is satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer. Where necessary for the protection of the revenue or enforcement of 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, the appropriate TTB officer may require that the portions of wine premises alternated under this section be separated by partitions or otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions. Authority for the alternation of bonded wine premises, taxpaid wine bottling house premises, taxpaid wine premises, or other premises qualified under 26 U.S.C chapter 51 is

conditioned on compliance by the proprietor with the provisions of this section. Authority for the alternation of bonded wine premises, taxpaid wine bottling house premises, taxpaid wine premises, or other premises qualified under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization.
