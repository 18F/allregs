The resins have a pore size of 2.0 to 3.0 milliliters per gram of dry resin (expressed in terms of water regain), and a particle size of 10 to 300 microns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The molecular sieve resins are thoroughly washed with potable water prior to their first use in contact with food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Molecular sieve resins are used as the gel filtration media in the final purification of partially delactosed whey. The gel bed shall be maintained in a sanitary manner in accordance with good manufacturing practice so as to prevent microbial build-up on the bed and adulteration of the product.</p>
