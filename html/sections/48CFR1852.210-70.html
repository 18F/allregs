The term ``bid'' means ``offer'' if this is a negotiated acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If items called for by this solicitation are identified in the Schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, that identification is intended to be descriptive, not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering ``equal'' products, including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name, will be considered for award if the products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements referenced in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless the offeror clearly indicates in the bid that it is offering an ``equal'' product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand-name product referenced in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the solicitation, or that product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the offeror or identified in its bid, as well as on other information reasonably available to the contracting activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the offeror proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the solicitation, or that product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the offeror or identified in its bid, as well as on other information reasonably available to the contracting activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Caution to Offerors: The contracting office is not responsible for locating or securing any information not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the contracting office. Accordingly, to ensure that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a part of its bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting office to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirements of the solicitation and (ii) establish exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the solicitation, it shall (i) include in the bid a clear description of the proposed modifications and (ii) clearly mark any descriptive material to show them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If this is a sealed-bid acquisition, modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the solicitation will not be considered.</p><p class="depth3">(End of provision)
