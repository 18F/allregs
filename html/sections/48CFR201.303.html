                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(i)</em> The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of  Federal Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or  supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental  numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly  with its FAR counterpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with  the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts,  sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of  70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number  of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are  numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without  skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would  be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70  (a), (b), and (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the  numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then  italicized lower case Roman numerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the  FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering  uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1-1--DFARS Numbering ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">FAR             Is implemented as          Is supplemented as ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 19                 219                        219.70 19.5               219.5                      219.570 19.501             219.501                    219.501-70 19.501-1           219.501-1                  219.501-1-70 19.501-1(a)        219.501-1(a)               219.501-1(a)(S-70) 19.501-1(a)(1)     219.501-1(a)(1)            219.501-1(a)(1)(S-70) ------------------------------------------------------------------------   [56 FR 36284, July 31, 1991, as amended at 64 FR 51074, Sept. 21, 1999]</p>
