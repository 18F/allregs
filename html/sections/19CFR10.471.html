                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures to determine whether a claim of origin is accurate. For the purpose of determining that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate, CBP may request that the government of Chile conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP may take appropriate action, as directed by The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), which may include suspending the application of preferential treatment to the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made. If CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, CBP may take appropriate action with respect to the textile and apparel good subject to the verification, and with respect to similar goods exported or produced by the entity that exported or produced the good, if directed by CITA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures to determine compliance with applicable customs laws and regulations of the U.S. For purposes of enabling CBP to determine that an exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures in cases in which CBP has a reasonable suspicion that a Chilean exporter or producer is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods, CBP may request that the government of Chile conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. A ``reasonable suspicion'' for the purpose of this paragraph will be based on relevant factual information, including information of the type set forth in Article 5.5 of the US-CFTA, that indicates circumvention of applicable laws, regulations or procedures regarding trade in textile and apparel goods. CBP may undertake or assist in a verification under this paragraph by conducting visits in Chile, along with the competent authorities of Chile, to the premises of an exporter, producer or any other enterprise involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods from Chile to the United States. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP may take appropriate action, as directed by CITA, which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile and apparel goods exported or produced by the Chilean entity where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. If CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, CBP may take appropriate action with respect to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the entity subject to the verification, if directed by CITA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assistance by CBP to Chilean authorities. CBP may undertake or assist in a verification under this section by conducting visits in Chile, along with the competent authorities of Chile, to the premises of an exporter, producer or any other enterprise involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods from Chile to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of documents and information provided to CBP. Any production, trade and transit documents and other information necessary to conduct a verification under this section, provided to CBP by the government of Chile consistent with the laws, regulations, and procedures of Chile, will be considered confidential as provided for in Article 5.6 of the US-CFTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification to Chile. Prior to commencing appropriate action under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, CBP will notify the government of Chile. CBP may continue to take appropriate action under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section until it receives information sufficient to enable it to make the determination described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retention of authority by CBP. If CBP requests a verification before Chile fully implements its obligations under Article 3.21 of the US-CFTA, the

verification will be conducted principally by CBP, including through means described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. CBP retains the authority to exercise its rights under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
