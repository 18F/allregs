                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Audits and investigations are official examinations of books,  records, documents, other writings and information to ensure that the  provisions of the Defense Production Act and other applicable statutes,  this part, and official actions have been properly followed. An audit or  investigation may also include interviews and a systems evaluation to  detect problems or failures in the implementation of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When undertaking an audit or investigation, the Department of  Energy shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the  person under investigation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have ascertained that the information sought or other adequate  and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other  responsible agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In administering this part, the Department of Energy may issue  the following documents that constitute official actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administrative Subpoenas. An Administrative Subpoena requires a  person to appear as a witness before an official designated by the  Department of Energy to testify under oath on matters of which that  person has knowledge relating to the enforcement or the administration  of the Defense Production Act and other applicable statutes, this part,  or official actions. An Administrative Subpoena may also require the  production of books, papers, records, documents and physical objects or  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demands for Information. A Demand for Information requires a  person to furnish to a duly authorized representative of the Department  of Energy any information necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or  the administration of the Defense Production Act and other applicable  statutes, this part, or official actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection Authorizations. An Inspection Authorization requires  a person to permit a duly authorized representative of the Department of  Energy to interview the person's employees or agents, to inspect books,  records, documents, other writings, and information, including  electronically-stored information, in the person's possession or control  at the place where that person usually keeps them or otherwise, and to  inspect a person's property when such interviews and inspections are  necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the  Defense Production Act and related statutes, this part, or official  actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The production of books, records, documents, other writings, and  information will not be required at any place other than where they are  usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the  Administrative Subpoena or Demand for Information, a duly authorized  official of the Department of Energy is furnished with copies of such  material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an  alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly  authorized official of Department of Energy as to the content of the  material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or  Inspection Authorization, shall include the name,   title, or official position of the person to be served, the evidence  sought to be adduced, and its general relevance to the scope and purpose  of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents  are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or  information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the  Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection  Authorization will describe them with particularity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service of documents shall be made in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service of a Demand for Information or Inspection Authorization  shall be made personally, or by Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested  at the person's last known address. Service of an Administrative  Subpoena shall be made personally. Personal service may also be made by  leaving a copy of the document with someone at least 18 years old at the  person's last known dwelling or place of business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a  partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by  appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is  served, a copy of the document shall be mailed to the person named in  the document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any individual 18 years of age or over may serve an  Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection  Authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the  service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was  made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit,  and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing  officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure  shall be stated on the original document.</p>
