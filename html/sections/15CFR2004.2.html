USTR consults with governments, business groups, legislators, and public interest groups to obtain their views on trade issues and explain the President's trade policy positions. The general functions of USTR, as provided by statute, are to develop and coordinate international trade and direct investment policy, advise and assist the President, represent the United States in international trade negotiations, and provide policy guidance to federal agencies on international trade matters. The United States Trade Representative, a cabinet officer, serves as a vice chairman of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Board member of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a non-voting member of the Export-Import Bank, and a member of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.</p>
