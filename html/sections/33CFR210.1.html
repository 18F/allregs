                            <p class="depth0">In connection with all construction contracts estimated to cost $100,000 or more for which an invitation is scheduled to be issued, an advance notice to prospective bidders will be prepared sufficiently in advance of the actual issuance of the invitation to stimulate

interest on the part of the greatest possible number of contractors. Advance notices may also be prepared on projects estimated to cost less than $100,000 and for supplies where considered desirable. ENG Form 3132-R or ENG Form 3133-R [set out in paragraphs 205 and 206, Appendix A, Engineer Contract Instructions (ER 1180-1-1)] will be used to send advance notices to prospective bidders. Lengthy notices may be reproduced and mailed using ENG Form 3133-R as a foldover wrapper fastened with a wire staple. Advance notices will contain the information required by ENG Form 3132-R, but additional information may be added as appropriate. The advance notices will:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Describe the proposed work in sufficient detail to permit prospective general contractors, subcontractors and suppliers to determine reasonably whether the work is of a nature and volume to warrant their buying plans;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specify the date by which bidders should return the request card in order to receive a complete bid set;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State the various locations (offices) where plans will be on public display, available for inspection without charge; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Include for construction contracts a statement as to the approximate value of the proposed construction. That statement of value shall be in increments as follows: (1) Less than $25,000; (2) the nearest multiple of $25,000 up to $100,000; (3) the nearest multiple of $100,000 from $100,000 to $1 million; (4) the nearest multiple of $500,000 for from $1 million to $10 million; (5) over $10 million for all projects of greater estimated value.
Information on several projects for which invitations are scheduled to be issued may be grouped in one advance notice provided that information on any project or projects is not unduly delayed in order to be grouped with others. When an advance notice is used to circularize bidders, copies of the invitation, when issued, will be furnished only to those prospective bidders who have returned a request card indicating a desire to submit a bid.
