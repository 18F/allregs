The following individuals may certify signatures on transaction request forms:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Officers and employees of depository institutions, corporate central credit unions, and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs who have been authorized:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Generally to bind their respective institutions by their acts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unqualifiedly to guarantee signatures to assignments of securities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To certify assignments of securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officers and authorized employees of Federal Reserve Banks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Officers of Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and Banks for Cooperatives, the Central Bank for Cooperatives, and Federal Home Loan Banks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commissioned officers and warrant officers of the Armed Forces of the United States but only with respect to signatures executed by Armed Forces personnel, civilian field employees, and members of their families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other persons as the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service or his designee may authorize.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign countries. The following individuals are authorized to certify signatures on transaction request forms executed in a foreign country:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> United States diplomatic or consular officials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Managers and officers of foreign branches of depository institutions and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notaries public and other officers authorized to administer oaths, provided their official position and authority are certified by a United States diplomatic or consular official under seal of the office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duties and liabilities of certifying individuals--(1) General. Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a certifying individual shall require that the transaction request form be signed in the certifying individual's presence after he or she has established the identity of the person seeking the certification. An employee who is not an officer should insert the words ``Authorized signature'' in the space provided for the title. A certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the individual's negligence in making the certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a certifying individual shall require that the transaction request form be signed in the certifying individual's presence after he or she has established the identity of the person seeking the certification. An employee who is not an officer should insert the words ``Authorized signature'' in the space provided for the title. A certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the individual's negligence in making the certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Signature guaranteed. The transaction request form need not be executed in the presence of a certifying individual if he or she unqualifiedly guarantees the signature, in which case the certifying individual shall, after the signature, add the following endorsement: ``Signature guaranteed, First National Bank of Smithville, Smithville, NH, by A.B. Doe, President'', and add the date. In guaranteeing a signature, the certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting warrant to the Department that the signature is genuine and that the signer had the legal capacity to execute the transaction request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Absence of signature guaranteed by depository institution. A transaction request form need not be actually signed by the owner in any case where a certifying individual associated with a depository institution has placed an endorsement on the form reading substantially as follows: ``Absence of signature by owner and validity of transaction guaranteed, Second State Bank of Jonesville, Jonesville, NC, by B.R. Butler, Vice President''. The endorsement should be dated, and the seal of the institution should be added. This form of endorsement is an unconditional guarantee to the Department that the institution is acting for the owner under proper authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence of certifying individual's authority. The authority of a certifying individual to act is evidenced by affixing to the certification the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Officers and employees of depository institutions. The institution's seal or

signature guarantee stamp; if the institution is an authorized paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds, a legible imprint of the paying agent's stamp; or, if the institution is a member of the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), a legible imprint of the STAMP signature guarantee stamp.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officers and authorized employees of institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs.

A statement which sets out the officer's rank and the fact that the person executing the transaction request is one whose signature the officer is authorized to certify under the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Such other persons as the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service or his designee may authorize. The evidence specified by the Commissioner or his designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interested persons not to act as certifying individual. Neither the transferor, the transferee, nor any person having an interest in a security involved in the transaction may act as a certifying individual. However, an authorized officer or employee of a depository institution or of an institution that is a member of a Treasury-recognized signature guarantee program may act as a certifying individual on a transaction request for transfer of a security to the institution, or any request executed by another individual on behalf of the institution.
