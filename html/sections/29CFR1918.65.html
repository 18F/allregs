                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to every type of  mechanically powered vehicle used for material or equipment handling  aboard a vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Modifications, such as adding counterweights that  might affect the vehicle's capacity or safety, shall not be done without  either the manufacturers' prior written approval or the written approval  of a registered professional engineer experienced with the equipment,  who has consulted with the manufacturer, if available. Capacity,  operation and maintenance instruction plates, tags or decals shall be  changed to conform to the equipment as modified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rated capacities, with and without removable counterweights,  shall not be exceeded. Rated capacities shall be marked on the vehicle  and shall be visible to the operator. The vehicle weight, with and  without a counterweight, shall be similarly marked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If loads are lifted by two or more trucks working in unison, the  total weight shall not exceed the combined safe lifting capacity of all  trucks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guards for fork lift trucks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as noted in paragraph  (c)(5) of this section, fork lift trucks shall be equipped with overhead  guards securely attached to the machines. The guard shall be of such  design and construction as to protect the operator from boxes, cartons,  packages, bagged material, and other similar items of cargo that might  fall from the load being handled or from stowage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overhead guards shall not obstruct the operator's view, and  openings in the top of the guard shall not exceed six inches (15.24 cm)  in one of the two directions, width or length. Larger openings are  permitted if no opening allows the smallest unit of cargo being handled  through the guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Overhead guards shall be built so that failure of the vehicle's  mast tilting mechanism will not displace the guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Overhead guards shall be large enough to extend over the  operator during all truck operations, including forward tilt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An overhead guard may be removed only when it would prevent a  truck from entering a work space and only if the operator is not exposed  to low overhead obstructions in the work space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where necessary to protect the operator, fork lift trucks shall  be fitted with a vertical load backrest extension to prevent the load  from hitting the mast when the mast is positioned at maximum backward  tilt. For this purpose, a ``load backrest extension'' means a device  extending vertically from the fork carriage frame to prevent raised  loads from falling backward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guards for bulk cargo-moving vehicles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every crawler type,  rider operated, bulk cargo-moving vehicle shall be equipped with an  operator's guard of such design and construction as to protect the  operator, when seated, against injury from contact with a projecting  overhead hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Overhead guards and their attachment points shall be so designed  as to be able to withstand, without excessive deflection, a load applied  horizontally at the operator's shoulder level equal to the drawbar pull  of the machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Overhead guards are not required when the vehicle is used in  situations in which the seated operator cannot contact projecting  overhead hazards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After July 26, 1999, bulk cargo-moving vehicles shall be  equipped with rollover protection of such design and construction as to  prevent the possibility of the operator being crushed because of a  rollover or upset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Approved trucks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Approved power-operated industrial  truck'' means one listed as approved for the intended use or location by  a nationally recognized testing laboratory (see Sec. 1910.7 of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approved power-operated industrial trucks shall bear a label or  other identification indicating testing laboratory approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the atmosphere in an area is hazardous (see Sec. 1918.2  and Sec. 1918.93), only approved power-operated industrial trucks shall  be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Maintenance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mechanically powered vehicles shall be  maintained in safe working order. Safety devices shall not be removed or  made inoperative except where permitted in this section. Vehicles with a  fuel system leak or any other safety defect shall not be operated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Braking systems or other mechanisms used for braking shall be  operable and in safe condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Replacement parts whose function might affect operational safety  shall be equivalent in strength and performance capability to the  original parts that they replace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Repairs to the fuel and ignition systems of mechanically powered  vehicles that involve fire hazards shall be conducted only in locations  designated as safe for such repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Batteries on all mechanically powered vehicles shall be  disconnected during repairs to the primary electrical system except when  power is necessary for testing and repair. On vehicles equipped with  systems capable of storing residual energy, that energy shall be safely  discharged before work on the primary electrical system begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Only designated persons shall do maintenance and repair.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Parking brakes. All mechanically powered vehicles purchased  after January 21, 1998, shall be equipped with parking brakes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Operation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only stable and safely arranged loads within the  rated capacity of the mechanically powered vehicle shall be handled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall require drivers to ascend and descend grades  slowly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the load obstructs the forward view, the employer shall  require drivers to travel with the load trailing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Steering knobs shall not be used unless the vehicle is equipped  with power steering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When mechanically powered vehicles use cargo lifting devices  that have a means of engagement hidden from the operator, a means shall  be provided to enable the operator to determine that the cargo has been  engaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No load on a mechanically powered vehicle shall be suspended or  swung over any employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When mechanically powered vehicles are used, provisions shall be  made to ensure that the working surface can support the vehicle and  load, and that hatch covers, truck plates, or other temporary surfaces  cannot be dislodged by movement of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When mechanically powered vehicles are left unattended, load- engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls   neutralized, brakes set and power shut off. Wheels shall be blocked or  curbed if the vehicle is on an incline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When lift trucks or other mechanically powered vehicles are  being operated on open deck-type barges, the edges of the barges shall  be guarded by railings, sideboards, timbers, or other means sufficient  to prevent vehicles from rolling overboard. When such vehicles are  operated on covered lighters where door openings other than those being  used are left open, means shall be provided to prevent vehicles from  rolling overboard through such openings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Unauthorized personnel shall not ride on mechanically powered  vehicles. A safe place to ride shall be provided when riding is  authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> An employee may be elevated by fork lift trucks only when a  platform is secured to the lifting carriage or forks. The platform shall  meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The platform shall have a railing complying with Sec.  1917.112(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The platform shall have toeboards complying with Sec.  1917.112(d) of this chapter, if tools or other objects could fall on  employees below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the truck has controls elevated with the lifting  carriage, means shall be provided for employees on the platform to shut  off power to the vehicle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Employees on the platform shall be protected from exposure to  moving truck parts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The platform floor shall be skid resistant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An employee shall be at the truck's controls whenever employees  are elevated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> While an employee is elevated, the truck may be moved only to  make minor adjustments in placement.  [62 FR 40202, July 25, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 40945, June 30, 2000]</p>
