                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in  Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of  continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in  the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset  conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to,  an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering,  transmittance or other effect to continuously monitor relative  particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Baghouse means a control device that collects particulate matter by  filtering the gas stream through bags. A baghouse is also referred to as  a ``fabric filter.''</p><p class="depth0">Batch copper converter means a Pierce-Smith converter or Hoboken  converter in which copper matte is oxidized to form blister copper by a  process that is performed in discrete batches using a sequence of  charging, blowing, skimming, and pouring.</p><p class="depth0">Blowing means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during  which air or oxygen-enriched air is injected into the molten converter  bath.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the collection of components used to capture  gases and fumes released from one or more emission points, and to convey  the captured gases and fumes to a control device. A capture system may  include, but is not limited to, the following components as applicable  to a given capture system design: duct intake devices, hoods,  enclosures, ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.</p><p class="depth0">Charging means the operating mode for a batch copper converter  during which molten or solid material is added into the vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means the air pollution control equipment used to  collect particulate matter emissions. Examples of such equipment  include, but are not limited to, a baghouse, an electrostatic  precipitator, and a wet scrubber.</p><p class="depth0">Copper concentrate dryer means a vessel in which copper concentrates  are heated in the presence of air to reduce the moisture content of the  material. Supplemental copper-bearing feed materials and fluxes may be  added or mixed with the copper concentrates fed to a copper concentrate  dryer.</p><p class="depth0">Copper converter department means the area at a primary copper  smelter in which the copper converters are located.</p><p class="depth0">Copper matte means a material predominately composed of copper and  iron sulfides produced by smelting copper ore concentrates.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to  this subpart or an owner or operator of such a source fails to meet any  of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any requirement or obligation established by this subpart  including, but not limited to, any emission limitation (including any  operating limit) or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable  requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit  for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work  practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or  malfunction, regardless whether or not such failure is permitted by this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Emission limitation means any emission limit, opacity limit,  operating limit, or visible emission limit.</p><p class="depth2">Fugitive dust material means copper concentrate, dross, reverts,  slag, speiss, or other solid copper-bearing materials.</p><p class="depth2">Fugitive dust source means a stationary source of particulate matter  emissions resulting from the handling, storage, transfer, or other  management of fugitive dust materials where the source is not associated  with a specific process, process vent, or stack. Examples of a fugitive  dust source include,   but are not limited to, on-site roadways used by trucks transporting  copper concentrate, unloading of materials from trucks or railcars,  outdoor material storage piles, and transfer of material to hoppers and  bins.</p><p class="depth2">Holding means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during  which the molten bath is maintained in the vessel but no blowing is  performed nor is material added into or removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Opacity means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission  of light.</p><p class="depth2">Particulate matter means any finely divided solid or liquid  material, other than uncombined water, as measured by the specific  reference method.</p><p class="depth2">Pouring means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during  which molten copper is removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Primary copper smelter means any installation or any intermediate  process engaged in the production of copper from copper sulfide ore  concentrates through the use of pyrometallurgical techniques.</p><p class="depth2">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR  70.2.</p><p class="depth2">Skimming means the batch copper converter operating mode during  which molten slag is removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Slag cleaning vessel means a vessel that receives molten copper- bearing material and the predominant use of the vessel is to separate  this material into molten copper matte and slag layers.</p><p class="depth2">Smelting furnace means a furnace, reactor, or other type of vessel  in which copper ore concentrate and fluxes are melted to form a molten  mass of material containing copper matte and slag. Other copper-bearing  materials may also be charged to the smelting furnace.</p><p class="depth2">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice,  or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated  pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Table 1 to Subpart QQQ of Part 63--Applicability of General</p><p class="depth2">Provisions to Subpart QQQ</p><p class="depth2">As required in Sec. 63.1457, you must comply with the requirements  of the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A) shown in  the following table:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Citation                        Subject           Applies to subpart QQQ        Explanation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sec. 63.1..........................
