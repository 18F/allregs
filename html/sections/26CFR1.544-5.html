                                Sec. 1.544-5  Convertible securities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under section 544(b) outstanding securities of a corporation such as bonds, debentures, or other corporate obligations, convertible into stock of the corporation (whether or not convertible during the taxable year) shall be considered as outstanding stock of the corporation. The consideration of convertible securities as outstanding stock is subject to the exception that, if some of the outstanding securities are convertible only after a later date than in the case of others, the class having the earlier conversion date may be considered as outstanding stock although the others are not so considered, but no convertible securities shall be considered as outstanding stock unless all outstanding securities having a prior conversion date are also so considered. For example, if outstanding securities are convertible in 1954, 1955 and 1956, those convertible in 1954 can be properly considered as outstanding stock without so considering those convertible in 1955 or 1956, and those convertible in 1954 and 1955 can be properly considered as outstanding stock without so considering those convertible in 1956. However, the securities convertible in 1955 could not be properly considered as outstanding stock without so considering those convertible in 1954 and the securities convertible in 1956 could not be properly considered as outstanding stock without so considering those convertible in 1954 and 1955. For the restriction on the applicability of the rule of this section, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.544-1.</p>
