                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Metabolites and degradates. Information which shows the  existence of any metabolite or degradate of a pesticide product must be  submitted if either of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The metabolite or degradate may occur or be present under  conditions of use of the pesticide product, and the existence of the  metabolite or degradate or the association of the metabolite or  degradate with the pesticide product has not been previously reported to  EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The metabolite or degradate has been previously reported, but it  is detected at levels higher than any previously reported; and either of  the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person described in Sec. 159.158(a) has concluded that the  metabolite or degradate may pose a toxicological or ecological risk  based on any one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The physical or chemical properties of the metabolite or  degradate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Data regarding structurally analogous chemicals.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Data regarding chemical reactivity of the metabolite or  degradate and structurally analogous substances.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Data on the metabolite or degradate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The registrant has concluded, or has been advised by any person  described in Sec. 159.158(a) that the metabolite or degradate, or  analogous chemicals, may have any experimentally determined half-life  greater than 3 weeks as shown from laboratory aerobic soil metabolism  studies or field dissipation studies, or may have any experimentally  determined resistance to hydrolytic degradation, or photolytic  degradation on soil or in water, under   any conditions, resulting in degradation of less than 10 percent in a  30-day period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contaminants and impurities. The presence in any pesticide  product of a contaminant or impurity not previously identified by the  registrant as part of the pesticide product's approved composition must  be reported pursuant to this part if the contaminant or impurity is  present in the product in any of the following quantities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quantities greater than 0.1 percent by weight (1,000 parts per  million).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quantities that EPA considers, and so informs registrants, to be  of toxicological significance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quantities that the registrant considers to be of toxicological  significance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quantities above a level for which the registrant has  information indicating that the presence of the contaminant or impurity  may pose a risk to health or the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Quantities that a person described in Sec. 159.158(a) has  informed the registrant is likely to be of toxicological significance.
