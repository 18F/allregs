For each hearing, a transcript will be prepared from the recording made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that will be the sole official transcript of the hearing. The transcript will be prepared by an official reporter who may be designated by the Commission or may be a regular employee of the Commission. Except as limited by section 181 of the Act or order of the Commission, the transcript will be available for inspection in the agency's public records system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability of copies. Copies of transcripts prepared in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are available to the parties and to the public from the official reporter on payment of the charges fixed therefor. If a hearing is recorded on videotape or other video medium, copies of the recording of each daily session of the hearing may be made available to the parties and to the public from the presiding officer upon payment of a charge specified by the Chief Administrative Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transcript corrections. Corrections of the official transcript may be made only in the manner provided by this paragraph. Corrections ordered or approved by the presiding officer must be included in the record as an appendix. When so incorporated, the Secretary shall make the necessary physical corrections in the official transcript so that it will incorporate the changes ordered. In making corrections, pages may not be substituted but, to the extent practicable, corrections must be

made by running a line through the matter to be changed without obliteration and writing the matter as changed immediately above. If the correction consists of an insertion, it must be added by rider or interlineation as near as possible to the text which is intended to precede and follow it.</p>
