                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Analyst means the  person or laboratory using a test procedure (analytical method) in this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemistry of the method means the reagents and reactions used in  a test procedure that allow determination of the analyte(s) of interest  in an environmental sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determinative technique means the way in which an analyte is  identified and quantified (e.g., colorimetry, mass spectrometry).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equivalent performance means that the modified method produces  results that meet or exceed the QC acceptance criteria of the approved  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Method-defined analyte means an analyte defined solely by the  method used to determine the analyte. Such an analyte may be a physical  parameter, a parameter that is not a specific chemical, or a parameter  that may be comprised of a number of substances. Examples of such  analytes include temperature, oil and grease, total suspended solids,  total phenolics, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical  oxygen demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> QC means ``quality control.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Method modifications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the underlying chemistry and  determinative   technique in a modified method are essentially the same as an approved  part 136 method, then the modified method is an equivalent and  acceptable alternative to the approved method provided the requirements  of this section are met. However, those who develop or use a  modification to an approved (part 136) method must document that the  performance of the modified method, in the matrix to which the modified  method will be applied, is equivalent to the performance of the approved  method. If such a demonstration cannot be made and documented, then the  modified method is not an acceptable alternative to the approved method.  Supporting documentation must, if applicable, include the routine  initial demonstration of capability and ongoing QC including  determination of precision and accuracy, detection limits, and matrix  spike recoveries. Initial demonstration of capability typically includes  analysis of four replicates of a mid-level standard and a method  detection limit study. Ongoing quality control typically includes method  blanks, mid-level laboratory control samples, and matrix spikes (QC is  as specified in the method). The method is considered equivalent if the  quality control requirements in the reference method are achieved. The  method user's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must clearly document  the modifications made to the reference method. Examples of allowed  method modifications are listed in this section. The user must notify  their permitting authority of the intent to use a modified method. Such  notification should be of the form ``Method xxx has been modified within  the flexibility allowed in 40 CFR 136.6.'' The user may indicate the  specific paragraph of Sec.  136.6 allowing the method modification.  However, specific details of the modification need not be provided, but  must be documented in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). If the  method user is uncertain whether a method modification is allowed, the  Regional ATP Coordinator or permitting authority should be contacted for  approval prior to implementing the modification. The method user should  also complete necessary performance checks to verify that acceptable  performance is achieved with the method modification prior to analyses  of compliance samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements. The modified method must be sufficiently sensitive  and meet or exceed performance of the approved method(s) for the  analyte(s) of interest, as documented by meeting the initial and ongoing  quality control requirements in the method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requirements for establishing equivalent performance. If the  approved method contains QC tests and QC acceptance criteria, the  modified method must use these QC tests and the modified method must  meet the QC acceptance criteria with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The analyst may only rely on QC tests and QC acceptance criteria  in a method if it includes wastewater matrix QC tests and QC acceptance  criteria (e.g., matrix spikes) and both initial (start-up) and ongoing  QC tests and QC acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the approved method does not contain QC tests and QC  acceptance criteria or if the QC tests and QC acceptance criteria in the  method do not meet the requirements of this section, then the analyst  must employ QC tests published in the ``equivalent'' of a Part 136  method that has such QC, or the essential QC requirements specified at  136.7, as applicable. If the approved method is from a compendium or  VCSB and the QA/QC requirements are published in other parts of that  organization's compendium rather than within the Part 136 method then  that part of the organization's compendium must be used for the QC  tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In addition, the analyst must perform ongoing QC tests,  including assessment of performance of the modified method on the sample  matrix (e.g., analysis of a matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate pair for  every twenty samples), and analysis of an ongoing precision and recovery  sample (e.g., laboratory fortified blank or blank spike) and a blank  with each batch of 20 or fewer samples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the performance of the modified method in the wastewater  matrix or reagent water does not meet or exceed the QC acceptance  criteria, the method modification may not be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements for documentation. The modified method must be  documented in a method write-up or an addendum that describes the  modification(s) to the approved method prior to the use of the method  for compliance purposes. The write-up or addendum must include a  reference number (e.g., method number), revision number, and revision  date so that it may be referenced accurately. In addition, the  organization that uses the modified method must document the results of  QC tests and keep these records, along with a copy of the method write- up or addendum, for review by an auditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Restrictions. An analyst may not modify an approved Clean Water  Act analytical method for a method-defined analyte. In addition, an  analyst may not modify an approved method if the modification would  result in measurement of a different form or species of an analyte.  Changes in method procedures are not allowed if such changes would alter  the defined chemistry (i.e., method principle) of the unmodified method.  For example, phenol method 420.1 or 420.4 defines phenolics as ferric  iron oxidized compounds that react with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) at pH  10 after being distilled from acid solution. Because total phenolics  represents a group of compounds that all react at different efficiencies  with 4-AAP, changing test conditions likely would change the behavior of  these different phenolic compounds. An analyst may not modify any sample  collection, preservation, or holding time requirements of an approved  method. Such modifications to sample collection, preservation, and  holding time requirements do not fall within the scope of the  flexibility allowed at Sec.  136.6. Method flexibility refers to  modifications of the analytical procedures used for identification and  measurement of the analyte only and does not apply to sample collection,  preservation, or holding time procedures, which may only be modified as  specified in Sec.  136.3(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allowable changes. Except as noted under paragraph (b)(3) of  this section, an analyst may modify an approved test procedure  (analytical method) provided that the underlying reactions and  principles used in the approved method remain essentially the same, and  provided that the requirements of this section are met. If equal or  better performance can be obtained with an alternative reagent, then it  is allowed. A laboratory wishing to use these modifications must  demonstrate acceptable method performance by performing and documenting  all applicable initial demonstration of capability and ongoing QC tests  and meeting all applicable QC acceptance criteria as described in Sec.   136.7. Some examples of the allowed types of changes, provided the  requirements of this section are met include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changes between manual method, flow analyzer, and discrete  instrumentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in chromatographic columns or temperature programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes between automated and manual sample preparation, such  as digestions, distillations, and extractions; in-line sample  preparation is an acceptable form of automated sample preparation for  CWA methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In general, ICP-MS is a sensitive and selective detector for  metal analysis; however isobaric interference can cause problems for  quantitative determination, as well as identification based on the  isotope pattern. Interference reduction technologies, such as collision  cells or reaction cells, are designed to reduce the effect of  spectroscopic interferences that may bias results for the element of  interest. The use of interference reduction technologies is allowed,  provided the method performance specifications relevant to ICP-MS  measurements are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The use of EPA Method 200.2 or the sample preparation steps from  EPA Method 1638, including the use of closed-vessel digestion, is  allowed for EPA Method 200.8, provided the method performance  specifications relevant to the ICP-MS are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Changes in pH adjustment reagents. Changes in compounds used to  adjust pH are acceptable as long as they do not produce interference.  For example, using a different acid to adjust pH in colorimetric  methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Changes in buffer reagents are acceptable provided that the  changes do not produce interferences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Changes in the order of reagent addition are acceptable  provided that the change does not alter the chemistry and does not  produce an interference. For example, using the same reagents, but  adding them in different order, or preparing them in combined or  separate solutions (so they can be added separately), is allowed,  provided reagent stability or method performance is equivalent or  improved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Changes in calibration range (provided that the modified range  covers any relevant regulatory limit and the method performance  specifications for calibration are met).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Changes in calibration model. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Linear calibration models do  not adequately fit calibration data with one or two inflection points.  For example, vendor-supplied data acquisition and processing software on  some instruments may provide quadratic fitting functions to handle such  situations. If the calibration data for a particular analytical method  routinely display quadratic character, using quadratic fitting functions  may be acceptable. In such cases, the minimum number of calibrators for  second order fits should be six, and in no case should concentrations be  extrapolated for instrument responses that exceed that of the most  concentrated calibrator. Examples of methods with nonlinear calibration  functions include chloride by SM4500-Cl-E-1997, hardness by EPA Method  130.1, cyanide by ASTM D6888 or OIA1677, Kjeldahl nitrogen by PAI-DK03,  and anions by EPA Method 300.0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> As an alternative to using the average response factor, the  quality of the calibration may be evaluated using the Relative Standard  Error (RSE). The acceptance criterion for the RSE is the same as the  acceptance criterion for Relative Standard Deviation (RSD), in the  method. RSE is calculated as:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  x[min]i = Calculated concentration at level i xi = Actual concentration of the calibration level i n = Number of calibration points p = Number of terms in the fitting equation (average = 1, linear = 2,</p><p class="depth0">quadratic = 3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Using the RSE as a metric has the added advantage of allowing  the same numerical standard to be applied to the calibration model,  regardless of the form of the model. Thus, if a method states that the  RSD should be <=20% for the traditional linear model through the origin,  then the RSE acceptance limit can remain <=20% as well. Similarly, if a  method provides an RSD acceptance limit of <=15%, then that same figure  can be used as the acceptance limit for the RSE. The RSE may be used as  an alternative to correlation coefficients and coefficients of  determination for evaluating calibration curves for any of the methods  at part 136. If the method includes a numerical criterion for the RSD,  then the same numerical value is used for the RSE. Some older methods do  not include any criterion for the calibration curve--for these methods,  if RSE is used the value should be <=20%. Note that the use of the RSE  is included as an alternative to the use of the correlation coefficient  as a measure of the suitability of a calibration curve. It is not  necessary to evaluate both the RSE and the correlation coefficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Changes in equipment such as equipment from a vendor different  from the one specified in the method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> The use of micro or midi distillation apparatus in place of  macro distillation apparatus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> The use of prepackaged reagents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> The use of digital titrators and methods where the underlying  chemistry used for the determination is similar to that used in the  approved method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Use of selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode for analytes that  cannot be effectively analyzed in full-scan mode and reach the required  sensitivity. False positives are more of a concern when using SIM  analysis, so at a minimum, one quantitation and two qualifying ions must  be monitored for each analyte (unless fewer than three ions with  intensity greater than 15% of the base peak are available). The ratio of  each of the two qualifying ions to the quantitation ion must be  evaluated and should agree with the ratio observed in an authentic  standard within 20 percent. Analyst judgment must  be applied to the evaluation of ion ratios because the ratios can be  affected by co-eluting compounds present in the sample matrix. The  signal-to-noise ratio of the least sensitive ion should be at least 3:1.  Retention time in the sample should match within 0.05 minute of an  authentic standard analyzed under identical conditions. Matrix  interferences can cause minor shifts in retention time and may be  evident as shifts in the retention times of the internal standards. The  total scan time should be such that a minimum of eight scans are  obtained per chromatographic peak.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Changes are allowed in purge-and-trap sample volumes or  operating conditions. Some examples are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Changes in purge time and purge-gas flow rate. A change in purge  time and purge-gas flow rate is allowed provided that sufficient total  purge volume is used to achieve the required minimum detectible  concentration and calibration range for all compounds. In general, a  purge rate in the range 20-200 mL/min and a total purge volume in the  range 240-880 mL are recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use of nitrogen or helium as a purge gas, provided that the  required sensitivities for all compounds are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sample temperature during the purge state. Gentle heating of the  sample during purging (e.g., 40 [deg]C) increases purging efficiency of  hydrophilic compounds and may improve sample-to-sample repeatability  because all samples are purged under precisely the same conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Trap sorbent. Any trap design is acceptable, provided that the  data acquired meet all QC criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Changes to the desorb time. Shortening the desorb time (e.g.,  from4 minutes to 1 minute) may not affect compound recoveries, and can  shorten overall cycle time and significantly reduce the amount of water  introduced to the analytical system, thus improving the precision of  analysis, especially for water-soluble analytes. A desorb time of four  minutes is recommended, however a shorter desorb time may be used,  provided that all QC specifications in the method are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Use of water management techniques is allowed. Water is always  collected on the trap along with the analytes and is a significant  interference for analytical systems (GC and GC/MS). Modern water  management techniques (e.g., dry purge or condensation points) can  remove moisture from the sample stream and improve analytical  performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> The following modifications are allowable when performing EPA  Method 625: The base/neutral and acid fractions may be added together  and analyzed as one extract, provided that the analytes can be reliably  identified and quantified in the combined extracts; the pH extraction  sequence may be reversed to better separate acid and neutral components;  neutral components may be extracted with either acid or base components;  a smaller sample volume may be used to minimize matrix interferences  provided matrix interferences are demonstrated and documented;  alternative surrogate and internal standard concentrations other than  those specified in the method are acceptable, provided that method  performance is not degraded; an alternative concentration range may be  used for the calibration other than the range specified in the method;  the solvent for the calibration standards may be changed to match the  solvent of the final sample extract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviii)</em> If the characteristics of a wastewater matrix prevent  efficient recovery of organic pollutants and prevent the method from  meeting QC requirements, the analyst may attempt to resolve the issue by  adding salts to the sample, provided that such salts do not react with  or introduce the target pollutant into the sample (as evidenced by the  analysis of method blanks, laboratory control samples, and spiked  samples that also contain such salts), and that all requirements of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. Samples having residual  chlorine or other halogen must be dechlorinated prior to the addition of  such salts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xix)</em> If the characteristics of a wastewater matrix result in poor  sample dispersion or reagent deposition on equipment and prevent the  analyst from meeting QC requirements, the analyst may attempt to resolve  the issue by adding a inert surfactant that does not affect the  chemistry of the method, such as Brij-35 or sodium dodecyl sulfate  (SDS), provided that such surfactant does not react with or introduce  the target pollutant into the sample (as evidenced by the analysis of  method blanks, laboratory control samples, and spiked samples that also  contain such surfactant) and that all requirements of paragraph (b)(1)  and (b)(2) of this section are met. Samples having residual chlorine or  other halogen must be dechlorinated prior to the addition of such  surfactant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xx)</em> The use of gas diffusion (using pH change to convert the  analyte to gaseous form and/or heat to separate an analyte contained in  steam from the sample matrix) across a hydrophobic semi-permeable  membrane to separate the analyte of interest from the sample matrix may  be used in place of manual or automated distillation in methods for  analysis such as ammonia, total cyanide, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and  total phenols. These procedures do not replace the digestion procedures  specified in the approved methods and must be used in conjunction with  those procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxi)</em> Changes in equipment operating parameters such as the  monitoring wavelength of a colorimeter or the reaction time and  temperature as needed to achieve the chemical reactions defined in the  unmodified CWA method. For example, molybdenum blue phosphate methods  have two absorbance maxima, one at about 660 nm and another at about 880  nm. The former is about 2.5 times less sensitive than the latter.  Wavelength choice provides a cost-effective, dilution-free means to  increase sensitivity of molybdenum blue phosphate methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxii)</em> Interchange of oxidants, such as the use of titanium oxide in  UV-assisted automated digestion of TOC and total phosphorus, as long as  complete oxidation can be demonstrated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxii)</em> Use of an axially viewed torch with Method 200.7.  [77 FR 29810, May 18, 2012]</p><p class="depth0">Editorial Note: At 77 FR 29810, May 18, 2012, Sec.  136.6 was  revised to include two paragraphs designated (b)(4)(xxii).</p>
