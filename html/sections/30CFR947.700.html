                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal  mining operations in Washington which have been adopted under the  Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Most of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts  of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a  rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section  of the Washington Federal program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining  operations in Washington conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands.  The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal  lands in Washington.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The information collection requirements contained in this part  do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44  U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following provisions of Washington laws generally provide  for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects  of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface  Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the regulations in this chapter.  Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not  generally be construed to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a  particular instance the rules in this Chapter are found by OSM to  establish more stringent environmental controls:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Washington Clean Air Act, RCW 70.94.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Washington Food Fish and Shell Fish Laws pertaining to the  Department of Fisheries on operation in streams, RCW 75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Washington Hydraulic Projects Approval Law, RCW 75.20.100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Washington Forest Practices Act, RCW 76.09.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Washington Water Code, RCW 90.03.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Washington Water Pollution Control Act, RCW 90.48.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Washington Minimum Water Flows and Levels Act, RCW 90.22.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Washington Shoreline Management Act, RCW 90.58.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Washington Pesticide Control Act, RCW 15.58.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following are the Washington law and regulations that  generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and  requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of  the Act, preempted and superseded. Other Washington laws may in an  individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of the  Act and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance  standards of Sec. Sec. 947.815 through 947.828 as they affect a  particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication  of a notice to that effect in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Washington Surface Mining Act of 1971, Revised Code of  Washington (RCW) 78.44, as related to surface coal mining, except to the  extent that it regulates surface coal mining operations which affect two  acres or less or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining  Control and Reclamation Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface Mined Land Reclamation regulations, Washington  Administrative Code (WAC) 332-18, as they apply to surface coal mining,  except to the extent that such regulations apply to surface coal mining  operations which affect two acres or less or which otherwise are not  regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance  standards of Sec. Sec. 947.815 through 947.828 of this part if the  applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface coal mining  reclamation permit submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec. 947.772 through  947.785 of this part demonstrates in the application:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That such a variance is necessary because of the nature of the  terrain, climate, biological, chemical, or other relevant physical  conditions in the area of the mine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If applicable, that the proposed variance is no less effective  than the environmental protection requirements of the regulations in  this program and is consistent with the Act.
