DHS policy is that an Alert or Activation should be as cost neutral as possible to Sponsoring Agencies and Participating Agencies.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, DHS will not reimburse a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency for any costs greater than those that the Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency actually incurs during an Alert, Activation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Normal or predetermined practices. Consistent with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002, Sponsoring Agencies and Participating Agencies must adhere to their own normal and predetermined practices and policies of general application when requesting reimbursement from DHS except as it sets out in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Indirect costs. Indirect costs beyond the administrative and management costs allowance established by Sec. 208.41 of this part are not allowable.
