                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The business results measures will consist of  numerical scores determined under the quality measures and the quantity  measures described elsewhere in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quality measures. Quality measures will be determined on the  basis of a review by a specially dedicated staff within the IRS of a  statistically valid sample of work items handled by certain functions or  organizational units determined by the Commissioner or his delegate such  as the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examination and collection units and Automated Collection System  Units (ACS). The quality review of the handling of cases involving  particular taxpayers will focus on such factors as whether IRS personnel  devoted an appropriate amount of time to a matter, properly analyzed the  facts, and complied with statutory, regulatory, and IRS procedures,  including timeliness, adequacy of notifications, and required contacts  with taxpayers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Toll-free telephone sites. The quality review of telephone  services will focus on such factors as whether IRS personnel provided  accurate tax law and account information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other work units. The quality review of other work units will be  determined according to criteria prescribed by the Commissioner or his  delegate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Quantity measures. Quantity measures will consist of outcome- neutral production and resource data that does not contain information  regarding the tax enforcement result reached in any case that involves  particular taxpayers. Examples of quantity measures include, but are not  limited to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cases started;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cases closed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Work items completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Customer education, assistance, and outreach efforts completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Time per case;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Direct examination time/out of office time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cycle time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Number or percentage of overage cases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Inventory information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Toll-free level of access; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Talk time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tax enforcement results. A tax enforcement  result is the outcome produced by an IRS employee's exercise of judgment  in recommending or determining whether or how the IRS should pursue  enforcement of the tax laws. Examples of tax enforcement results include  a lien filed, a levy served, a seizure executed, the amount assessed,  the amount collected, and a fraud referral. Examples of data that are  not tax enforcement results include a quantity measure and data derived  from a quality review or from a review of an employee's or a work unit's  work on a case, such as the number or percentage of cases in which  correct examination adjustments were proposed or appropriate lien  determinations were made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records of tax enforcement results. Records of tax enforcement  results are data, statistics, compilations of information or other  numerical or quantitative recordations of the tax enforcement results  reached in one or more cases. Such records may be used for purposes such  as forecasting, financial planning, resource management, and the  formulation of case selection criteria. Records of tax enforcement  results may be used to develop methodologies and algorithms for use in  selecting tax returns to audit. Records of tax enforcement results do  not include tax enforcement results of individual cases when used to  determine whether an employee exercised appropriate judgment in pursuing  enforcement of the tax laws based upon a review of the employee's work  on that individual case.
