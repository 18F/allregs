Sec.   501.6 (a)(1) or (a)(2) applies in determining the respective rights of  the Government and of an employee in and to any invention, the agency  may determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United  States pending the Secretary's decision on the dispute. If the agency  decides that an application for patent should be filed, the agency will  take such rights as are specified in Sec.  501.6(a)(2), but this shall  be without prejudice to acquiring the rights specified in paragraph  (a)(1) of that section should the Secretary so decide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where an agency has determined to leave title to an invention  with an employee under Sec.  501.6(a)(2), the agency will, upon the  filing of an application for patent, take the rights specified in that  paragraph without prejudice to the subsequent acquisition by the  Government of the rights specified in paragraph (a)(1) of that section  should the Secretary so decide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where an agency has filed a patent application in the United  States, the agency will, within 8 months from the filing date of the  U.S. application, determine if any foreign patent applications should  also be filed. If the agency chooses not to file an application in any  foreign country, the employee may request rights in that country subject  to the conditions stated in Sec.  501.7(b) that may be imposed by the  agency. Alternatively, the agency may permit the employee to retain  foreign rights by including in any assignment to the Government of an  unclassified U.S. patent application on the invention an option for the  Government to acquire title in any foreign country within 8 months from  the filing date of the U.S. application.
