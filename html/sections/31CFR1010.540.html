                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial institution. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph  (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the term ``financial institution'' means any  financial institution described in 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2) that is required  under this chapter to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering  program, or is treated under this chapter as having satisfied the  requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5318(h)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, a financial institution shall not  mean any institution included within a class of financial institutions  that FinCEN has designated as ineligible to share information under this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Association of financial institutions means a group or  organization the membership of which is comprised entirely of financial  institutions as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary information sharing among financial institutions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In general. Subject to paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this  section, a financial institution or an association of financial  institutions may, under the protection of the safe harbor from liability  described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, transmit, receive, or  otherwise share information with any other financial institution or  association of financial institutions regarding individuals, entities,  organizations, and countries for purposes of identifying and, where  appropriate, reporting activities that the financial institution or  association suspects may involve possible terrorist activity or money  laundering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> shall be effective for  the one year period beginning on the date of the notice. In order to  continue to engage in the sharing of information after the end of the  one year period, a financial institution or association of financial  institutions must submit a new notice. Completed notices may be  submitted to FinCEN by accessing FinCEN's Internet Web site, http:// www.fincen.gov., and entering the appropriate information as directed,  or, if a financial institution does not have Internet access, by mail  to: FinCEN, P.O. Box 39, Vienna, VA 22183.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> by confirming that the  other financial institution or association of financial institutions  appears on a list that FinCEN will periodically make available to  financial institutions or associations of financial institutions that  have filed a notice with it, or by confirming directly with the other  financial institution or association of financial institutions that the  requisite notice has been filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use and security of information. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information received by a  financial institution or an association of financial institutions  pursuant to this section shall not be used for any purpose other than:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identifying and, where appropriate, reporting on money  laundering or terrorist activities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Determining whether to establish or maintain an account, or to  engage in a transaction; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Assisting the financial institution in complying with any  requirement of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> shall be deemed satisfied to the extent that a financial  institution applies to such information procedures that the institution  has established to satisfy the requirements of section 501 of the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801), and applicable regulations issued  thereunder, with regard to the protection of its customers' nonpublic  personal information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Safe harbor from certain liability--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A financial  institution or association of financial institutions that shares  information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be protected  from liability for such sharing, or for any failure to provide notice of  such sharing, to an individual, entity, or organization that is  identified in such sharing, to the full extent provided in subsection  314(b) of Public Law 107-56.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. Paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section shall not apply  to a financial institution or association of financial institutions to  the extent such institution or association fails to comply with  paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information sharing between financial institutions and the  Federal Government. If, as a result of information shared pursuant to  this section, a financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to  suspect that an individual, entity, or organization is involved in, or  may be involved in terrorist activity or money laundering, and such  institution is subject to a suspicious activity reporting requirement  under this chapter or other applicable regulations, the institution  shall file a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with those  regulations. In situations involving violations requiring immediate  attention, such as when a reportable violation involves terrorist  activity or is ongoing, the financial institution shall immediately  notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and  financial institution supervisory authorities in addition to filing  timely a Suspicious Activity Report. A financial institution that is not  subject to a suspicious activity reporting requirement is not required  to file a Suspicious Activity Report or otherwise to notify law  enforcement of suspicious activity that is detected as a result of  information shared pursuant to this section. Such a financial  institution is encouraged, however, to voluntarily report such activity  to FinCEN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No effect on financial institution reporting obligations.  Nothing in this subpart affects the obligation of a financial  institution to file a Suspicious Activity Report pursuant to this  chapter or any other applicable regulations, or to otherwise contact  directly a Federal agency concerning individuals or entities suspected  of engaging in terrorist activity or money laundering.</p>
