                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the applicable labeling requirements of Sec. Sec.  610.62 through 610.65 and Sec. 809.10 of this chapter, and in lieu of  the requirements in Sec. Sec. 610.60 and 610.61 of this chapter, the  following requirements shall be met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Final container label--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Color coding. The main panel of the  final container label of all Anti-IgG, -C3d (polyspecific) reagents  shall be white or colorless and printing shall be solid dark contrasting  lettering. The main panel of the final container label of all other  Anti-Human Globulin reagents shall be black with solid white lettering.  A logo or company name may be placed on the final container label,  however, the logo or company name shall be located along the bottom or  end of the label, outside of the main panel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Required information. The proper name ``Anti-Human Globulin''  need not appear on the final container label provided the final  container is distributed in a package and the package label bears the  proper name. The final container label shall bear the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the antibody or antibodies present as set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section. Anti-Human Globulin may contain one or  more antibodies to either immunoglobulins or complement components but  the name of each significant antibody must appear on the final container  label (e.g., anti-C3b, -C3d, -C4d). The final container labels of  polyspecific Anti-Human Globulin are not required to identify antibody  specificities other than anti-IgG and anti-C3d but the reactivity of the  Anti-Human Globulin shall be accurately described in the package insert.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name, address, and license number of the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Lot number, including any sublot designations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Expiration date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Source of the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Recommended storage temperature in degrees Celsius.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Volume of product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Appropriate cautionary statement if the Anti-Human Globulin  is not polyspecific. For example, ``DOES NOT CONTAIN ANTIBODIES TO  IMMUNOGLOBULINS'' or ``DOES NOT CONTAIN ANTIBODIES TO COMPLEMENT  COMPONENTS.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> If the final container is not enclosed in a package, all items  required for a package label shall appear on the container label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lettering size. The type size for the designation of the  specific antibody on the label of a final container shall be not less  than 12 point, unless otherwise approved by the Director, Center for  Biologics Evaluation and Research. The prefix anti- and other parts of  the name such as polyspecific may appear in smaller type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Visual inspection. When the label has been affixed to the final  container, a sufficient area of the container shall remain uncovered for  its full length or for no less than 5 millimeters of the lower  circumference to permit inspection of the contents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Package label. The following items shall appear either on the  package label or on the final container label if see-through packaging  is used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proper name of the product, and the name of the antibody or  antibodies as listed in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, address (including zip code), and license number of the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lot number, including any sublot designations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expiration date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Preservative(s) used and its concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Number of containers, if more than one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Recommended storage temperature in degrees Celsius.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Source of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Reference to enclosed package insert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The statement: ``For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The statement: ``Meets FDA Potency Requirements.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A statement of an observable indication of an alteration of the  product, e.g., turbidity, color change, precipitate, that may indicate  possible deterioration of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Appropriate cautions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Package insert. Each final container of Anti-Human Globulin  shall be accompanied by a package insert meeting the requirements of  Sec. 809.10 of this chapter. If two or more final containers requiring  identical package inserts are placed in a single package, only one  package insert per package is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Names of antibodies.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Antibody designation on container</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Anti-IgG, -C3d; Polyspecific......
