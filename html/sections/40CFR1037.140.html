                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where applicable, a vehicle's curb weight and roof height are  determined from nominal design specifications, as provided in this  section. Round the weight to the nearest pound and height to the nearest  inch. Base roof height on fully inflated tires having a static loaded  radius equal to the arithmetic mean of the largest and smallest static  loaded radius of tires you offer or a standard tire we approve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The nominal design specifications must be within the range of  the actual weights and roof heights of production vehicles considering  normal production variability. If after production begins it is  determined that your nominal design specifications do not represent  production vehicles, we may require you to amend your application for  certification under Sec.  1037.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your vehicle is equipped with an adjustable roof fairing,  measure the roof height with the fairing in its lowest setting.</p>
