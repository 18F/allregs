                            <p class="depth0">In exercising its rule-making power, this Commission performs a legislative function. The delegation of this power by the Congress imposes the obligation upon the members to adopt rules necessary to effectuate the stated policies of the statute in the interest of all of the people. Care should be taken to avoid the adoption of rules which seek to extend the power of the Commission beyond proper statutory limits. Its rules should never tend to stifle or discourage legitimate business enterprises or activities, nor should they be interpreted so as unduly and unnecessarily to burden those regulated with onerous obligations. On the other hand, the very statutory enactments evidence the need for regulation, and the necessary rules should be adopted or modifications made or rules should be repealed as changing requirements demand without fear or favor.</p>
