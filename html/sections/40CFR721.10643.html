                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to  reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified generically as  diisocyanate terminated polycarbodiimide (PMN P-04-640) is subject to  reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do  not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been completely  reacted (cured).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec.  721.63(a)(1),   (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(ii), and (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent).  When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as  required for Sec. 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures  (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local  ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace  policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent  or reduce exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified supplied-air respirator  operated in pressure demand or other positive pressure mode and equipped  with a tight-fitting full facepiece with an assigned protection factor  (APF) of at least 2,000 meets the minimum requirements of Sec.  721.63(a)(4). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed  here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the  new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section  5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.05 mg/m\3\. Persons  whose Sec. 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by  EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the  corresponding section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv) (use respiratory protection or  maintain airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted  average of 0.05 mg/m\3\), (g)(2)(v), and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements  as specified in Sec. 721.80(o).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. Recordkeeping requirements as specified in Sec.  721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers and processors of  this substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements.  The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.  [79 FR 51907, Sept. 2, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 60760, Oct. 8, 2014]</p>
