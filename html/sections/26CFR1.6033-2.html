                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in section 6033(a)(3) and  paragraph (g) of this section, every organization exempt from taxation  under section 501(a) shall file an annual information return  specifically setting forth its items of gross income, gross receipts and  disbursements, and such other information as may be prescribed in the  instructions, issued with respect to the return. Except as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section, such return shall be filed annually  regardless of whether such organization is chartered by, or affiliated  or associated with, any central, parent, or other organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraph  (g) of this section, every organization exempt from taxation under  section 501(a), and required to file a return under section 6033 and  this section (including, for taxable years ending before December 31,  1972, private foundations, as defined in section 509(a)), other than an  organization described in section 401(a) or 501(d), shall file its  annual return on Form 990. For taxable years ending on or after December  31, 1972, every private foundation shall file Form 990-PF as its annual  information return. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977,  every section 501(c)(21) black lung trust shall file an annual  information return on Form 990-BL or   any other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for that  purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The information generally required to be furnished by an  organization exempt under section 501(a) is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Its gross income for the year. For this purpose, gross income  includes tax-exempt income, but does not include contributions, gifts,  grants, and similar amounts received. Whether an item constitutes a  contribution, gift, grant, or similar amount depends upon all the  surrounding facts and circumstances. The computation of gross income  shall be made by subtracting the cost of goods sold from all receipts  other than gross contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts  received and nonincludible dues and assessments from members and  affiliates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To the extent not included in gross income, its dues and  assessments from members and affiliates for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Its expenses incurred within the year attributable to gross  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Its disbursements (including prior years' accumulations) made  within the year for the purposes for which it is exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A balance sheet showing its assets, liabilities, and net worth  as of the beginning and end of such year. Detailed information relating  to the assets, liabilities, and net worth shall be furnished on the  schedule provided for this purpose on the return required by this  section. Such schedule shall be supplemented by attachments where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The total of the contributions, gifts, grants and similar  amounts received by it during the taxable year, and the names and  addresses of all persons who contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000  or more (in money or other property) during the taxable year. In the  case of a private foundation (as defined in section 509(a)), the names  and addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors (as  defined in section 507(d)(2)) during the taxable year shall be  furnished. In addition, for its first taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1969, each private foundation shall furnish the names and  addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors before such  taxable year. For special rules with respect to contributors and donors,  see subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The names and addresses of all officers, directors, or trustees  (or any person having responsibilities or powers similar to those of  officers, directors or trustees) of the organization, and, in the case  of a private foundation, all persons who are foundation managers, within  the meaning of section 4946(b)(1). Organizations must also attach a  schedule showing the names and addresses and/or total numbers of key  employees, highly compensated employees, and independent contractors as  prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> A schedule showing the compensation and other payments made to  each person whose name is required to be listed pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(g) of this section during the calendar year ending within the  organization's annual accounting period, or during such other period as  prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1971, such  information as is required by Forms 4848 and 4849 and, only with respect  to any such taxable year ending before December 31, 1972, such  information as is required by Form 2950. Such forms are required by this  section to be filed by an organization exempt from tax under section  501(a) which is an employer who maintains a funded pension or annuity  plan for its employees. See paragraph (g) of this section for exceptions  from filing. Form 4849 need not be filed by the organization if the  fiduciary for the plan has given written notification to the  organization that such form will be filed as an attachment to Form 990-P  filed by the fiduciary. Form 4848 (and Form 4849 if required to be filed  by the organization) shall be filed as a separate return on or before  the due date for Form 990. For rules relating to the extension of time  for filing, see section 6081 and the regulations thereunder and the  instructions for Form 4848. A central organization which files Form 990  as a group return under paragraph (d) of this section may also file Form  4848 as a group return. The rules provided by paragraph (d) of this  section with respect to a group return filed on   Form 990 shall apply to a group return filed on Form 4848. Unless  otherwise expressly provided therein, an authorization to include a  local organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 990 as a group  return shall be treated as an authorization to include such local  organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 4848 as a group  return. A group return on Form 4848 shall be filed in accordance with  this section and the instructions to Form 4848 and shall be considered  the return of each local organization included therein. In addition to  the information required to be furnished by Forms 4848 and 4849, the  district director may require any further information that he considers  necessary to determine qualification of the plan under section 401 or  the taxability under section 403(b) of a beneficiary under an annuity  purchased by a section 501(c)(3) organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> In the case of a private foundation liable for tax imposed under  chapter 42, such information as is required by Form 4720.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Its lobbying expenditures, grass roots expenditures, exempt  purpose expenditures, lobbying nontaxable amount, and grass roots  nontaxable amount for the taxable year and for prior taxable years that  are base years (within the meaning of Sec. 1.501(h)-3(c)(7)), if the  organization has an election under section 501(h) in effect for the  taxable year. An organization that is a member of an affiliated group of  organizations (as defined in Sec. 56.4911-7(e)) but that is not a  member of a limited affiliated group (as defined in Sec. 56.4911-10(b))  shall report this information based on the expenditures of all members  of the group during the taxable year of the group that ends with or  within the member's taxable year and for prior taxable years of the  group that are base years (within the meaning of Sec. 56.4911-9(b)).  For additional information required to be furnished by members of an  affiliated group of organizations, and by controlling members in a  limited affiliated group, see Sec. Sec. 56.4911-9(d) and 56.4911- 10(f)(1), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> In the case of a hospital organization (as defined in Sec.  1.501(r)-1(b)(18)) described in section 501(c)(3) during the taxable  year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A copy of its audited financial statements for the taxable year  (or, in the case of an organization the financial statements of which  are included in consolidated financial statements with other  organizations, such consolidated financial statements);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Either a copy of the most recently adopted implementation  strategy, within the meaning of Sec. 1.501(r)-3(c), for each hospital  facility it operates or the URL of each Web page where it has made each  such implementation strategy widely available on a Web site within the  meaning of Sec. 1.501(r)-1(b)(29) along with or as part of the report  documenting the community health needs assessment (CHNA) to which the  implementation strategy relates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each hospital facility it operates, a description of the  actions taken during the taxable year to address the significant health  needs identified through its most recently conducted CHNA, within the  meaning of Sec. 1.501(r)-3(b), or, if no actions were taken with  respect to one or more of these health needs, the reason(s) why no  actions were taken; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The amount of the excise tax imposed on the organization under  section 4959 during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules. In providing the names and addresses of  contributors and donors under subdivision (ii)(f) of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An organization described in section 501(c)(3) which meets the  33\1/3\ percent-of-support test of the regulations under section  170(b)(1)(A)(vi) (without regard to whether such organization otherwise  qualifies as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)) is  required to provide the name and address of a person who contributed,  bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more during the year only if his amount  is in excess of 2 percent of the total contributions, bequests and  devises received by the organization during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An organization other than a private foundation is required to  report only the names and addresses of contributors of whom it has  actual knowledge. For instance, an organization need not require an  employer who withholds contributions from the compensation of employees  and pays over   to the organization periodically the total amounts withheld, to specify  the amounts paid over with respect to a particular employee. In such  case, unless the organization has actual knowledge that a particular  employee gave more than $5,000 (and in excess of 2 percent if (a) of  this subdivision is applicable), the organization need report only the  name and address of the employer, and the total amount paid over by him.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Separate and independent gifts made by one person in a  particular year need be aggregated to determine if his contributions and  bequests exceed $5,000 (and in excess of 2 percent if (a) of this  subdivision is applicable), only if such gifts are of $1,000 or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Organizations described in section 501(c) (8) or (10) (and,  for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, organizations  described in section 501(c)(7)) that receive contributions or bequests  to be used exclusively for purposes described in section 170(c)(4),  2055(a)(3), or 2522(a)(3), must attach a schedule with respect to all  gifts which aggregate more than $1,000 from any one person showing the  name of the donor, the amount of the contribution or bequest, the  specific purpose for which such amount was received, and the specific  use to which such amount was put. In the case of an amount set aside for  such purposes, the organization shall indicate the manner in which such  amount is held (for instance, whether such amount is commingled with  amounts held for other purposes). If the contribution or bequest was  transferred to another organization, the schedule must include the name  of the transferee organization, a description of the nature of such  organization, and a description of the relationship between the  transferee and transferor organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, such  organizations must also attach a statement showing the total dollar  amount of contributions and bequests received for such purposes which  are $1,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Listing of States. A private foundation is required to attach  to its return required by this section a list of all States:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To which the organization reports in any fashion concerning its  organization, assets, or activities, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With which the organization has registered (or which it has  otherwise notified in any manner) that it intends to be, or is, a  charitable organization or a holder of property devoted to a charitable  purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and  ending before December 31, 1971, every employee's trust described in  section 401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall  file an annual return on Form 990-P. The return shall include the  information required by paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of Sec. 1.401-1. For such  years, in addition, the trust must file the information required to be  filed by the employer pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.404(a)-2,  unless the employer has notified the trustee in writing that he has  filed or will timely file such information. If the trustee has received  such notification from the employer, then such notification, or a copy  thereof, shall be retained by the trust as a part of its records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1971, and  before December 31, 1975, every employee's trust described in section  401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an  annual return on Form 990-P. The trust shall furnish such information as  is required by such form and the instructions issued with respect  thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, trusts  described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations shall  comply with the requirements of section 6033 and this section in the  same manner as organizations described in section 501(c)(3) which are  exempt from tax under section 501(a). This section shall be applied for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980 as if trusts described  in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations were described  in section 501(c)(3). Therefore, for purposes of this section, all  references to exempt organizations shall include section 4947(a)(1)  trusts and nonexempt private foundations and all references to private  foundations shall include section 4947(a)(1) trusts that would be  private   foundations if they were described in section 501(c)(3) and all  nonexempt private foundations. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph  (a)(2)(ii)(d), the purposes for which a section 4947(a)(1) trust or a  nonexempt private foundation is organized shall be treated as the  purposes for which it is exempt. For purposes of this section, the term  ``nonexempt private foundation'' means a taxable organization (other  than a section 4947(a)(1) trust) that is a private foundation. See  section 509(b) and Sec. 1.509(b)-1. See also section 642(c)(6) and  Sec. 1.642(c)-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Accounting period for filing return. A return required by this  section shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting  period of the organization. If the organization has no such established  accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Returns when exempt status not established. An organization  claiming an exempt status under section 501(a) prior to the  establishment of such exempt status under section 501 and Sec.  1.501(a)-1, shall file a return required by this section in accordance  with the instructions applicable thereto. In such case the organization  must indicate on such return that it is being filed in the belief that  the organization is exempt under section 501(a), but that the Internal  Revenue Service has not yet recognized such exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Group returns. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A central, parent, or like organization  (referred to in this paragraph as ``central organization''), exempt  under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c) (other than a  private foundation), although required to file a separate annual return  for itself under section 6033 and paragraph (a) of this section, may  file annually, in addition to such separate annual return, a group  return on Form 990. Such group return may be filed for two or more of  the local organizations, chapters, or the like (referred to in this  paragraph as ``local organizations'') which are (i) affiliated with such  central organization at the close of its annual accounting period, (ii)  subject to the general supervision or control of the central  organization, and (iii) exempt from taxation under the same paragraph of  section 501(c) of the Code, although the local organizations are not  necessarily exempt under the paragraph under which the central  organization is exempt. Such group return may not be filed for a local  organization which is a private foundation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The filing of the group return shall be in lieu of the filing  of a separate return by each of the local organizations included in the  group return. The group return shall include only those local  organizations which in writing have authorized the central organization  to include them in the group return, and which have made and filed, with  the central organization, their statements, specifically stating their  items of gross income, receipts, and disbursements, and such other  information relating to them as is required to be stated in the group  return. Such an authorization and statement by a local organization  shall be made under the penalties of perjury, shall be signed by a duly  authorized officer of the local organization in his official capacity,  and shall contain the following statement, or a statement of like  import: ``I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury that this  authorization (including any accompanying schedules and statements) has  been examined by me and to the best of my knowledge and belief is true,  correct and complete and made in good faith.'' Such authorization and  statement with respect to a local organization shall be retained by the  central organization until the expiration of 6 years after the last  taxable year for which a group return filed by such central organization  includes such local organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There shall be attached to the group return and made a part  thereof a schedule showing the name, address, and employer  identification number of each of the local organizations and the total  number thereof included in such return, and a schedule showing the name,  address, and employer identification number of each of the local  organizations and the total number thereof not included in the group  return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The group return shall be on the basis of the established annual  accounting period of the central organization. Where such central  organization has no established annual accounting period, such return  shall be on the basis of the calendar year. The same income, receipts,  and disbursements of a local organization shall not be included in more  than one group return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The group return shall be filed in accordance with these  regulations and the instructions issued with respect to Form 990, and  shall be considered the return of each local organization included  therein. The tax exempt status of a local organization must be  established under a group exemption letter issued to the central  organization before a group return including the local organization will  be considered as the return of the local organization. See Sec.  1.501(a)-1 for requirements for establishing a tax-exempt status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In providing the information required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)  (f), (g), and (h) of this section, such information may be provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the central or parent organization on its Form  990, and with respect to the local organizations on separate schedules  attached to the group return for the year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  subparagraph, and may not change the manner in which it provides such  information without the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time and place for filing. The annual return required by this  section shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth calendar  month following the close of the period for which the return is required  to be filed. The annual return on Form 1065 required to be filed by a  religious or apostolic association or corporation shall be filed on or  before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the  taxable year for which the return is required to be filed. Each such  return shall be filed in accordance with the instructions applicable  thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Penalties and additions to tax. For penalties and additions to  tax for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent  return, see sections 6652, 7203, 7206, and 7207.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Organizations not required to file annual returns. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual  returns required by this section are not required to be filed by an  organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) which is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A church, an interchurch organization of local units of a  church, a convention or association of churches, or an integrated  auxiliary of a church (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exclusively religious activity of any religious order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An organization (other than a private foundation) described in  section 6033(a)(3)(C), the gross receipts of which in each taxable year  are normally not more than $5,000 (as described in paragraph (g)(3) of  this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A mission society (other than an organization described in  section 509(a)(3)) sponsored by or affiliated with one or more churches  or church denominations, more than one-half of the activities of which  society are conducted in, or directed at persons in foreign countries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A State institution, the income of which is excluded from gross  income under section 115(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> An organization described in section 501(c)(1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An educational organization (below college level) that is  described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii), that has a program of a general  academic nature, and that is affiliated (within the meaning of paragraph  (h)(2) of this section) with a church or operated by a religious order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of section 6033(a) relieving certain specified  types of organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(a) from  filing annual returns do not abridge or impair in any   way the powers and authority of district directors or directors of  service centers provided for in other provisions of the Code and in  regulations thereunder to require the filing of returns or notices by  such organizations. See section 6001 and Sec. 1.6001-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the  gross receipts (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) of an  organization are normally not more than $5,000 if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an organization which has been in existence for 1  year or less, the organization has received, or donors have pledged to  give, gross receipts of $7,500 or less during the first taxable year of  the organization,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an organization which has been in existence for  more than one but less than 3 years, the average of the gross receipts  received by the organization in its first 2 taxable years is $6,000 or  less, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of an organization which has been in existence for  3 years or more, the average of the gross receipts received by the  organization in the immediately preceding 3 taxable years, including the  year for which the return would be required to be filed, is $5,000 or  less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (a)(2) of this  section, ``gross receipts'' means the gross amount received by the  organization during its annual accounting period from all sources  without reduction for any costs or expenses including, for example, cost  of goods or assets sold, cost of operations, or expenses of earning,  raising, or collecting such amounts. Thus ``gross receipts'' includes,  but is not limited to (i) the gross amount received as contributions,  gifts, grants, and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of  raising and collecting such amounts, (ii) the gross amount received as  dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without  reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts,  (iii) gross sales or receipts from business activities (including  business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization  qualifies for exemption, the net income or loss from which may be  required to be reported on Form 990-T), (iv) the gross amount received  from the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and  expenses of sale, and (v) the gross amount received as investment  income, such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Commissioner may relieve any organization or class of  organizations (other than an organization described in section  509(a)(3)) from filing, in whole or in part the annual return required  by this section where he determines that such returns are not necessary  for the efficient administration of the internal revenue laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Integrated auxiliary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

An organization is internally supported, for  purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, unless it both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offers admissions, goods, services or facilities for sale, other  than on an incidental basis, to the general public (except goods,  services, or facilities sold at a nominal charge or for an insubstantial  portion of the cost); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Normally receives more than 50 percent of its support from a  combination of governmental sources, public solicitation of  contributions, and receipts from the sale of admissions, goods,  performance of services, or furnishing of facilities in activities that  are not unrelated trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rule. Men's and women's organizations, seminaries,  mission societies, and youth groups that satisfy paragraphs (h)(1) (i)  and (ii) of this section are integrated auxiliaries of a church  regardless of whether such an organization meets the internal support  requirement under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (h) applies for returns filed for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For returns filed for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969 but beginning before  December 20, 1995, the definition for the term integrated auxiliary of a  church set forth in Sec. 1.6033-2(g)(5) (as contained in the 26 CFR  edition revised as of April 1, 1995) may be used as an alternative  definition to such term set forth in this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples of internal support. The internal support test of this  paragraph (h) is illustrated by the following examples, in each of which  it is assumed that the organization's provision of goods and services  does not constitute an unrelated trade or business:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Organization A is described in sections 501(c)(3) and  509(a)(2) and is affiliated (within the meaning of this paragraph (h))  with a church. Organization A publishes a weekly newspaper as its only  activity. On an incidental basis, some copies of Organization A's  publication are sold to nonmembers of the church with which it is  affiliated. Organization A advertises for subscriptions at places of  worship of the church. Organization A is internally supported,  regardless of its sources of financial support, because it does not  offer admissions, goods, services, or facilities for sale, other than on  an incidental basis, to the general public. Organization A is an  integrated auxiliary.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Organization B is a retirement home described in sections  501(c)(3) and 509(a)(2). Organization B is affiliated (within the  meaning of this paragraph (h)) with a church. Admission to Organization  B is open to all members of the community for a fee. Organization B  advertises in publications of general distribution appealing to the  elderly and maintains its name on non-denominational listings of  available retirement homes. Therefore, Organization B offers its  services for sale to the general public on more than an incidental  basis. Organization B receives a cash contribution of $50,000 annually  from the church. Fees received by Organization B from its residents  total $100,000 annually. Organization B does not receive any government  support or contributions from the general public. Total support is  $150,000 ($100,000 + $50,000), and $100,000 of that total is from  receipts from the performance of services (66\2/3\% of total support).  Therefore, Organization B receives more than 50 percent of its support  from receipts   from the performance of services. Organization B is not internally  supported and is not an integrated auxiliary.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Organization C is a hospital that is described in  sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(1). Organization C is affiliated (within  the meaning of this paragraph (h)) with a church. Organization C is open  to all persons in need of hospital care in the community, although most  of Organization C's patients are members of the same denomination as the  church with which Organization C is affiliated. Organization C maintains  its name on hospital listings used by the general public, and  participating doctors are allowed to admit all patients. Therefore,  Organization C offers its services for sale to the general public on  more than an incidental basis. Organization C annually receives $250,000  in support from the church, $1,000,000 in payments from patients and  third party payors (including Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers) for  patient care, $100,000 in contributions from the public, $100,000 in  grants from the federal government (other than Medicare and Medicaid  payments) and $50,000 in investment income. Total support is $1,500,000  ($250,000 + $1,000,000 + $100,000 + $100,000 + $50,000), and $1,200,000  ($1,000,000 + $100,000 + $100,000) of that total is support from  receipts from the performance of services, government sources, and  public contributions (80% of total support). Therefore, Organization C  receives more than 50 percent of its support from receipts from the  performance of services, government sources, and public contributions.  Organization C is not internally supported and is not an integrated  auxiliary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Records, statements, and other returns of tax-exempt  organizations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An organization that is exempt from taxation under  section 501(a) and is not required to file annually an information  return required by this section shall immediately notify in writing  Exempt Organizations Determinations, at an address prescribed by  publication (including publication on the Internal Revenue Service Web  site), of any changes in its character, operations, or purpose for which  it was originally created.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every organization which is exempt from tax, whether or not it  is required to file an annual information return, shall submit such  additional information as may be required by the Internal Revenue  Service for the purpose of inquiring into its exempt status and  administering the provisions of subchapter F (section 501 and  following), chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code, section 6033, and  chapter 42 of subtitle D of the Code. See section 6001 and Sec. 1.6001- 1 with respect to the authority of the district directors or directors  of service centers to require such additional information and with  respect to the books of account or records to be kept by such  organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An organization which has established its exemption from  taxation under section 501(a), including an organization which is  relieved under section 6033 and this section from filing annual returns  of information, is not relieved of the duty of filing other returns of  information. See, for example, sections 6041, 6043, 6051, 6057, and 6058  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Unrelated business tax returns.

See paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.6012-2 and paragraph (a)(5) of Sec.  1.6012-3 for requirements with respect to such returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally. The provisions of  this section shall apply with respect to returns filed for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(g)(6)</em> (as contained in 26 CFR part  1 revised April 1, 2006) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicability of paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(g) and (a)(2)(ii)(h)  of this section shall be limited to returns filed on or after January 1,  2008.

Sec. 1.6033- (a)(2)(ii)(g) and 1.6033-(2)(a)(2)(ii)(h) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1  revised April 1, 2008) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The applicability of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(l) of this section  shall be limited to returns filed on or after December 29, 2014.
