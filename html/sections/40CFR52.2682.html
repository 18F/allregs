                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of Sec. 51.27(a)(2) of this chapter as of December 19, 1978 (43 FR 59067), are not met. In addition, Chapter 1, Regulation 1.8 and Chapter 5, Regulation 5.3 of the ``Guam Air Pollution Control Standards and Regulations'' (buffer zones--air quality sampling) are not in conformance with the intent of the Clean Air Act and the definition of ``ambient air'' promulgated at Sec. 50.1(e) of this chapter. Regulations 1.8 and 5.3 are disapproved because they could prohibit ambient air quality sampling at places of expected maximum concentration and/or at places where the public has access.
