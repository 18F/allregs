                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulatory authority may approve the disposal of excess spoil through placement on a preexisting bench if the affected portion of the preexisting bench is permitted and the standards set forth in Sec. 817.102 (c), (e) through (h), and (j), and the requirements of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All vegetation and organic materials shall be removed from the affected portion of the preexisting bench prior to placement of the excess spoil. Any available topsoil on the bench shall be removed, stored and redistributed in accordance with Sec. 817.22 of this part. Substitute or supplemental materials may be used in accordance with Sec. 817.22(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fill shall be designed and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices. The design will be certified by a registered professional engineer. The spoil shall be placed on the solid portion of the bench in a controlled manner and concurrently compacted as necessary to attain a long term static safety factor of 1.3 for all portions of the fill. Any spoil deposited on any fill portion of the bench will be treated as excess spoil fill under Sec. 817.71.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The preexisting bench shall be backfilled and graded to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Achieve the most moderate slope possible which does not exceed the angle of repose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eliminate the highwall to the maximum extent technically practical;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimize erosion and water pollution both on and off the site; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design shall include diversions and underdrains as necessary to control erosion, prevent water infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, shall be revegetated upon completion of construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Permanent impoundments may not be constructed on preexisting benches backfilled with excess spoil under this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Final configuration of the backfill must be compatible with the natural drainage patterns and the surrounding area, and support the approved postmining land use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Disposal of excess spoil from an upper actively mined bench to a lower preexisting bench by means of gravity transport may be approved by the regulatory authority provided that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gravity transport courses are determined on a site-specific basis by the operator as part of the permit application and approved by the regulatory authority to minimize hazards to health and safety and to ensure that damage will be minimized between the benches, outside the set course, and downslope of the lower bench should excess spoil accidentally move;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All gravity transported excess spoil, including that excess spoil immediately below the gravity transport courses and any preexisting spoil that is disturbed, is rehandled and placed in horizontal lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and to prevent mass movement, and graded to allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with the natural surroundings and to ensure a minimum long-term static safety factor of 1.3. Excess spoil on the bench prior to the current mining operation that is not disturbed need not be rehandled except where necessary to ensure stability of the fill;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A safety berm is constructed on the solid portion of the lower bench prior to gravity transport of the excess spoil. Where there is insufficient material on the lower bench to construct a

safety berm, only that amount of excess spoil necessary for the construction of the berm may be gravity transported to the lower bench prior to construction of the berm;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excess spoil shall not be allowed on the downslope below the upper bench except on designated gravity transport courses properly prepared according to Sec. 817.22. Upon completion of the fill, no excess spoil shall be allowed to remain on the designated gravity transport course between the two benches and each transport course shall be reclaimed in accordance with the requirements of this part.
