                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The certificates of indebtedness will be issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226. They may not be transferred by sale, exchange, assignment or pledge, or otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Terms and rates of interest. The certificates, bearing interest at the rate of 5 percent per annum, will be issued in multiples of $1,000 and will mature one year from issue date. Interest on the certificates will be computed on an annual basis and, unless redeemed prior to maturity, will be payable six months from issue date and at maturity. Interest may be paid to an owner by having the amount thereof credited by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, acting as fiscal agent of the United States, to the reserve account of a member bank servicing such owner and for the latter's account. Such action will be taken at the owner's option. If not exercised, payment of interest will be made by Treasury check.
