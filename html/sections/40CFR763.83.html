Such damage or deterioration may be  illustrated by the separation of ACM into layers; separation of ACM from  the substrate; flaking, blistering, or crumbling of the ACM surface;  water damage; significant or repeated water stains, scrapes, gouges,  mars or other signs of physical injury on the ACM.

Such damage or deterioration may be illustrated by  the separation of ACM into layers; separation of ACM from the substrate;  flaking, blistering, or crumbling of the ACM surface; water damage;  significant or repeated water stains, scrapes, gouges, mars or other  signs of physical injury on the ACM. Asbestos debris originating from  the ACBM in question may also indicate damage.</p><p class="depth0">Damaged or significantly damaged thermal system insulation ACM means  thermal system insulation ACM on pipes, boilers, tanks, ducts, and other  thermal system insulation equipment where the insulation has lost its  structural integrity, or its covering, in whole or in part, is crushed,  water-stained, gouged, punctured, missing, or not intact such that it is  not able to contain fibers. Damage may be further illustrated by  occasional punctures, gouges or other signs of physical injury to ACM;  occasional water damage on the protective coverings/jackets; or exposed  ACM ends or joints. Asbestos debris originating from the ACBM in  question may also indicate damage.</p><p class="depth0">Encapsulation means the treatment of ACBM with a material that  surrounds or embeds asbestos fibers in an adhesive matrix to prevent the  release of fibers, as the encapsulant creates a membrane over the  surface (bridging encapsulant) or penetrates the material and binds its  components together (penetrating encapsulant).</p><p class="depth0">Enclosure means an airtight, impermeable, permanent barrier around  ACBM to prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the air.</p><p

building means that  the material, when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to  powder by hand pressure, and includes previously nonfriable material  after such previously nonfriable material becomes damaged to the extent  that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by  hand pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Functional space means a room, group of rooms, or homogeneous area  (including crawl spaces or the space between a dropped ceiling and the  floor or roof deck above), such as classroom(s), a cafeteria, gymnasium,  hallway(s), designated by a person accredited to prepare management  plans, design abatement projects, or conduct response actions.</p><p class="depth0">High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) refers to a filtering system  capable of   trapping and

insulation material, or miscellaneous material that is uniform in color  and texture.</p><p class="depth0">Local education agency means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any local educational agency as defined in section 198 of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 3381).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The owner of any nonpublic, nonprofit elementary, or secondary  school building.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The governing authority of any school operated under the defense  dependent's education system provided for under the Defense Dependents'  Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C. 921, et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Miscellaneous ACM means miscellaneous material that is ACM in a  school building.</p><p class="depth0">Miscellaneous material means interior building material on  structural components, structural members or fixtures, such as floor and  ceiling tiles, and does not include surfacing material or thermal system  insulation.</p><p class="depth0">Nonfriable means material in a school building which when dry may  not be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Operations and maintenance program means a program of work practices  to maintain friable ACBM in good condition, ensure clean up of asbestos  fibers previously released, and prevent further release by minimizing  and controlling friable ACBM disturbance or damage.</p><p class="depth0">Potential damage means circumstances in which:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Friable ACBM is in an area regularly used by building occupants,  including maintenance personnel, in the course of their normal  activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> There are indications that there is a reasonable likelihood that  the
