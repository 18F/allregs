                                Sec. 1120.25  Form of requests.

                            <p class="depth0">A request must be in writing, must reasonably describe the records  sought in a way that will permit their identification and location, and  must be addressed to the address set forth in Sec. 1120.23, but  otherwise need not be in any particular form. Each request under the  Freedom of Information Act should be clearly and prominently identified  by a legend on the first page, such as ``Freedom of Information Act  Request.'' The envelope in which the request is sent should be  prominently marked with the letters ``FOIA.'' It is helpful, but not  necessary, for the requestor to include his or her phone number and the  reason for the request. A request may state the maximum amount of fees  which the requester is willing to pay. Under Sec. 1120.33(d), the  failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated by  the A&TBCB; will delay running of the time limit and delay processing of  the request, if the responsible official anticipates that the fees  chargeable may exceed $250.00.
