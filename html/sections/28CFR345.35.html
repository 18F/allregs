                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An inmate or detainee may be considered for assignment with FPI  unless the inmate is a pretrial inmate or is currently under an order of  deportation, exclusion, or removal. However, an inmate or detainee who  is currently under an order of deportation, exclusion, or removal may be  considered for assignment with FPI if the Attorney General has  determined that the inmate or detainee cannot be removed from the United  States because the designated country of removal will not accept his/her  return. Any request by an inmate for consideration must be made through  the unit team. FPI does not discriminate on the bases of race, color,  religion, ethnic origin, age, or disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The SOI ordinarily makes assignments based on the recommendation  of the unit team.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New workers are ordinarily assigned at pay grade five. All  first-time inmate workers shall enter at pay grade five and may be  required to successfully complete a course in pre-industrial training or  on-the-job training (as available) before promotion to pay grade four.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An inmate who has not successfully completed pre-industrial or  on-the-job training remains at pay grade five for at least 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An inmate hired after having resigned voluntarily from FPI may  be excused from pre-industrial training and may be hired at a pay grade  based on previous training and experience.
