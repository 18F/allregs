The Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs may also authorize air  shipments falling within paragraph (a)(2) of this section in all cases  since the inherent time delays of surface transportation for such  shipments are considered unacceptable. The Deputy Administrator for  Defense Programs may also authorize air shipments falling within  paragraph (a)(3) of this section in cases where failure to make  shipments by air could jeopardize the national security of the United  States.
