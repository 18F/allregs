                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C 552a (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4); (e)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5); and (g):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Freedom of Information and Privacy Appeals Index (JUSTICE/OLP-001).

These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(2) and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) to the extent that information in this record system relates to official Federal investigations and matters of law enforcement. Individual access to these records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsections (e)(1) and (5) because in the course of law enforcement

investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of all information obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations or duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (g) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1) and (e)(1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> U.S. Judges Records System (JUSTICE/OLP-002).

These exemptions apply to the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (d)(1) because many persons are contracted who, without an assurance of anonymity, refuse to provide information concerning a candidate for a judgeship. Access could reveal the identity of the source of the information and constitute a breach of the promised confidentiality on the part of the Department. Such breaches ultimately would restrict the free flow of information vital to the determination of a candidate's qualifications and suitability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine advance what exact information may be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of a candidate. Information which may seem irrelevant, when combined with other seemingly irrelevant information, can on occasion provide a composite picture of a candidate which assists in determining whether that candidate should be nominated for appointment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following system of records is exempt from U.S.C. 552a(c) (3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H) (e)(5); and (g):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General Files System of the Office of Legal Policy (JUSTICE/OLP-003).

These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her would reveal investigative interest on the part of the Department as well as the recipient agency. This would permit record subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d) because the records contained in this system relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to these records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential informants, or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation. Amendment of records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible

administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information since it may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it would impede the specific investigation process if it were necessary to assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all information obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsections (e)(2) because in a law enforcement investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations and duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From subsection (g) because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (4); (d); (e)(1), (2) and (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5); and (g):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Declassification Review System (JUSTICE/OLP-004).

Individual access to these records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential sources or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation, or jeopardize national security or foreign policy interests. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation.
