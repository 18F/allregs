                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General application. Class 1 equivalency determinations will  establish, on a district-wide basis, the acreage of land with lower  productive potential (Classes 2, 3, and 4) that would be equivalent in  productive potential to the most suitable land (Class 1) in the local  agricultural economic setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reclamation establishes equivalency factors by comparing the  weighted average farm size required to produce a given level of income  on each of the lower classes of land with the farm size required to  produce that income level on Class 1 land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For equivalency purposes, Reclamation will classify all  irrigable land as Class 1, 2, or 3; no other classifications are  permissible for irrigable land. Class 4 and special-use land classes  will be allocated to one of these three classes on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Once the Class 1 equivalency determinations have been made,  individual landowners with land classified as 2 or 3 for equivalency  purposes will have the right to adjust their actual landholding acreage  to its Class 1 equivalent acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In a district subject to prior law, Class 1 equivalency can be  applied only to landholders who are subject to the discretionary  provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requests for equivalency determinations will be scheduled by  region, with the regional director of each Reclamation region having  responsibility for such scheduling. Generally, requests will be honored  on a first-come-first-served basis. However, if requests exceed the  region's ability to fulfill them expeditiously, priority will be given  on the basis of greatest immediate need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who may request a Class 1 equivalency determination? Only  districts may request Class 1 equivalency determinations. Upon the  request of any district subject to the acreage limitation provisions,  Reclamation will make a Class 1 equivalency determination for that  district. Equivalency determinations can be made only on a district-wide  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of Class 1 land. Class 1 land is defined and will be  classified as that irrigable land within a particular agricultural  economic setting that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Most completely meets the various parameters and specifications  established by Reclamation for irrigable land classes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has the relatively highest level of suitability for continuous,  successful irrigation farming; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is estimated to have the highest relative productive potential  measured in terms of net income per acre (reflecting both productivity  and costs of production). The equivalency analysis will establish the  acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in  productive potential (measured in terms of net farm income) to 1 acre of  Class 1 land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All land that Reclamation has not classified, or for which  Reclamation has not yet performed the necessary economic studies, will  be considered   Class 1 land for the purposes of determining entitlements under these  rules until such time as the necessary classifications or studies have  been completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of land classes. The extent and location of Class  1 land and land in lower land classes in a district have been, or will  be, determined by Reclamation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reclamation will take into account the influence of economic and  physical factors upon the productive potential of the land lying within  the district. These factors will include, but are not limited to the  following and their effect on agricultural practices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The physical and chemical characteristics of the soil;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Topography;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Drainage status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Costs of production;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Land development costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Water quality and adequacy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Elevation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Crop adaptability; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Length of growing season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acceptable levels of detail for land classification studies to  be utilized in making Class 1 equivalency determinations for a given  district will be evaluated on the basis of the physical and agricultural  economic characteristics of the area. For districts where the sole  purpose of the land classification study is for a Class 1 equivalency  determination, the level of detail of the land classification to be made  will never be greater than that required to make a Class 1 equivalency  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reclamation will pay for at least a portion of the costs  associated with the land classification study. The amount to be paid by  Reclamation will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reclamation has provided basic land classification data as part  of the project development process since 1924. Accordingly, if  Reclamation determines that acceptable land classification data are not  available for making requested Class 1 equivalency determinations and if  the project was authorized for construction since 1924, such data will  be made available at Reclamation's expense; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each district located in projects authorized for  construction prior to 1924, Reclamation will pay 50 percent of the costs  and the district must pay 50 percent of the costs of new land  classification studies required to make accurate Class 1 equivalency  determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When basic land classification data are available for a  district, but the district does not agree with the accuracy or asserts  that the data have become outdated, the district may request, and  Reclamation may perform, a reclassification under the authority  contained in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 485), with  the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requesting district will pay 50 percent of the costs of  performing such reclassifications and 100 percent of the costs of all  other studies involved in the equivalency process; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The results of such reclassifications will be binding upon the  requesting district and Reclamation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional studies required for Class 1 equivalency  determinations. Economic studies related to Class 1 equivalency  determinations will measure net farm income by land classes within the  district.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Net farm income will be determined by considering the disposable  income accruing to the farm operator's labor, management, and equity  from the sale of farm crops and livestock produced on irrigated land,  after all fixed and variable costs of production, including costs of  irrigation service, are accounted for.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net farm income will be the measure of productivity to establish  equivalency factors reflecting the acreage of each of the lower classes  of land which is equal in productive potential to 1 acre of Class 1  land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The cost of performing new or additional economic studies and  computations inherent in the equivalency process will be the  responsibility of the requesting district.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Use of Class 1 equivalency with the acreage limitation  provisions. Class 1 land and land in lower classes will be identified on  a district basis by Reclamation using a standard approach in which the  land classification for the entire district is considered. Equivalency  factors will then be computed for the district and applied to specific   tracts within individual landholdings. If adequate land classification  data are not available, they will be developed as specified in paragraph  (d) of this section using standard procedures established by  Reclamation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of ownership entitlement, Class 1 equivalency will  not be applied until a final determination has been made by Reclamation  concerning the district's request for equivalency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reclamation will protect excess landowners' property interests  by ensuring that equivalency determinations are completed in advance of  maturity dates on recordable contracts, provided the district requests  an equivalency determination at least 6 months prior to the maturity of  the recordable contract, the district fulfills its obligations under  this section, and the district notifies Reclamation 6 months in advance  of the maturity dates for the need for an expedited review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Once the determination has been made, owners of land subject to  recordable contracts may withdraw land from such recordable contracts in  order to reach their ownership entitlement in Class 1 equivalent  acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The requirement that land under recordable contract be sold at  a price approved by Reclamation does not apply to land which is  withdrawn from a recordable contract and included as part of a  landowner's nonexcess landholding as a result of an equivalency  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In cases of equivalency determination disputes, Reclamation  will not undertake the sale of the reasonable increment of the excess  land under a matured recordable contract which could be affected by a  reclassification, provided the dispute is determined by Reclamation not  to be an attempt to thwart the sale of excess land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of nonfull-cost entitlement, Class 1 equivalency  will not be applied until a final determination has been made by  Reclamation on a district's request for equivalency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the time when such determinations are pending, the full- cost rate will be assessed based on a landholder's nonfull-cost  entitlement as determined in the absence of Class 1 equivalency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Following Reclamation's final determination, Reclamation will  reimburse the district for any full-cost charges that would not have  been assessed had Class 1 equivalency been in place from the date of the  district's request. Districts will return such reimbursements to the  appropriate landholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A landholder with holdings in more than one district is entitled  to equivalency only in those districts which have requested equivalency  (or are already subject to equivalency). That part of the landholding in  a district or districts not requesting equivalency will be counted as  Class 1 land for purposes of overall entitlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Prior equivalency determinations. In districts where equivalency  was a provision of project authorization, those equivalency factor  determinations will be honored as originally calculated unless the  district requests a reclassification.</p>
