require a landing certificate before he completes the certificate of exportation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If practical, the Customs officer will give advance notice to the manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor of the type of transactions for which a landing certificate will be required. However, failure to notify the manufacturer or proprietor in advance will not prevent the Customs officer from requiring a landing certificate for specific exportations when he considers it necessary to protect the revenue. In any case, the Customs officer will advise the manufacturer or proprietor before departure of the shipment from the United States as to those exports for which a landing certificate will be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this section relating to landing certificates also apply when a Form 5200.14 is not required for each transaction (for example: When multiple exportations, individually documented by commercial records, are consolidated on a single Form 5200.14 pursuant to an approved alternate procedure under Sec. 44.72). The provisions apply to each transaction, regardless of the manner in which it is documented, unless specifically provided otherwise in the alternate procedure.
