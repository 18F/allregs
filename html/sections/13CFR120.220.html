                            <p class="depth0">A Lender must pay a guaranty fee to SBA for each loan it makes. If the guarantee fee is not paid, SBA may terminate the guarantee. Acceptance of the guaranty fee by SBA does not waive any right of SBA arising from a Lender's negligence, misconduct or violation of any provision of these regulations, the guaranty agreement, or the loan authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount of guaranty fee--(1) In general. Except to the extent paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, for a loan with a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, the guarantee fee which the Lender must pay to SBA is one-quarter (\1/4\) of one percent of the guaranteed portion of the loan. For a loan with a maturity of more than twelve (12) months, the guarantee fee is payable as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except to the extent paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, for a loan with a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, the guarantee fee which the Lender must pay to SBA is one-quarter (\1/4\) of one percent of the guaranteed portion of the loan. For a loan with a maturity of more than twelve (12) months, the guarantee fee is payable as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not more than 2 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan if the total amount of the loan is not more than $150,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not more than 3 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan if the total amount of the loan is more than $150,000 but not more than $700,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, not more than 3.5 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan if the total amount of the loan is more than $700,000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An additional 0.25 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan if the total amount of the loan is more than $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For loans approved October 1, 2002, through September 30, 2004. For a loan with a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, the guarantee fee which the Lender must pay to SBA is one-quarter (\1/4\) of one percent of the guaranteed portion of the loan. For a loan with a maturity of more than twelve (12) months, the guarantee fee is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 1 percent of the guaranteed portion of the loan if the total loan amount is not more than $150,000,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 2.5 percent of the guaranteed portion of a loan if the total loan amount is more than $150,000, but not more than $700,000, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 3.5 percent of the guaranteed portion if the total loan amount is more than $700,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the guaranty fee is payable. For a loan with a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, the Lender must pay the guaranty fee to SBA with its application for a guaranty. The Lender may charge the Borrower for the fee when the loan is approved by SBA. For a loan with a maturity in excess of twelve (12) months, the Lender must pay the guaranty fee to SBA within 90 days after SBA gives its loan approval. The Lender may charge the Borrower the fee after the Lender has made the first disbursement of the loan. The Borrower may use the loan proceeds to pay the guaranty fee. However, the first disbursement must not be made solely or primarily to pay the guaranty fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refund of guaranty fee. For a loan with a maturity of twelve (12) months or less, SBA will refund the guaranty fee if the loan application is withdrawn

prior to approval by SBA; if SBA declines to guarantee the loan; or if SBA substantially changes the Lender's loan terms and then approves the loan, but SBA's modified terms are unacceptable to the Lender. In the latter case, the Lender must request a refund in writing within 30 calendar days of SBA's approval. For a loan with a maturity of more than twelve (12) months, SBA will refund the guaranty fee if the Lender has not made any disbursement and the lender requests in writing the refund and cancellation of the SBA guaranty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lender's retention of portion of guaranty fee. With respect to a loan with a maturity of more than twelve (12) months, where the total loan amount is no more than $150,000 Lender may retain not more than 25 percent of the guaranty fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the guarantee fee is not paid, SBA may terminate the guarantee. The Borrower may use working capital loan proceeds to reimburse the Lender for the guarantee fee. Acceptance of the guarantee fee by SBA shall not waive any right of SBA arising from the Lender's misconduct or violation of any provision of this part, the guarantee agreement, the Authorization, or other loan documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lender's annual service fee payable to SBA--(1) In general. Except to the extent paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies, the lender shall pay SBA an annual service fee in an amount not to exceed 0.55 percent of the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion of each loan. The service fee cannot be charged to the Borrower. SBA may institute a late fee charge for delinquent payments of the annual service fee to cover administrative costs associated with collecting delinquent fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.
