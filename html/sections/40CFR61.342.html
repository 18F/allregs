                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual  benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 10 megagrams per year  (Mg/yr) (11 ton/yr) shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section. The total annual benzene quantity from  facility waste is the sum of the annual benzene quantity for each waste  stream at the facility that has a flow-weighted annual average water  content greater than 10 percent or that is mixed with water, or other  wastes, at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content  greater than 10 percent. The benzene quantity in a waste stream is to be  counted only once without multiple counting if other waste streams are  mixed with or generated from the original waste stream. Other specific  requirements for calculating the total annual benzene waste quantity are  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wastes that are exempted from control under Secs. 61.342(c)(2)  and 61.342(c)(3) are included in the calculation of the total annual  benzene quantity if they have an annual average water content greater  than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any  time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The benzene in a material subject to this subpart that is sold  is included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if  the material has an annual average water content greater than 10  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Benzene in wastes generated by remediation activities conducted  at the facility, such as the excavation of contaminated soil, pumping  and treatment of groundwater, and the recovery of product from soil or  groundwater, are not included in the calculation of total annual benzene  quantity for that facility. If the facility's total annual benzene  quantity is 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more, wastes generated by  remediation activities are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c)  through (h) of this section. If the facility is managing remediation  waste generated offsite, the benzene in this waste shall be included in  the calculation of total annual benzene quantity in facility waste, if  the waste streams have an annual average water content greater than 10  percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and  the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The total annual benzene quantity is determined based upon the  quantity of benzene in the waste before any waste treatment occurs to  remove the benzene except as specified in Sec. 61.355(c)(1)(i) (A)  through (C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual  benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/ yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of  this section no later than 90 days following the effective date, unless  a waiver of compliance has been obtained under Sec. 61.11, or by the  initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the  effective date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply  with the rule within the required time may request a waiver of  compliance under Sec. 61.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As part of the waiver application, the owner or operator shall  submit to the Administrator a plan under Sec. 61.10(b)(3) that is an  enforceable commitment to obtain environmental benefits to mitigate the  benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date. The  plan shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the method of compliance, including the control  approach, schedule for installing controls, and quantity of the benzene  emissions that result from extending the compliance date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the control approach involves a compliance strategy designed  to obtain integrated compliance with multiple regulatory requirements, a  description of the other regulations involved and their effective dates;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the actions to be taken at the facility to  obtain mitigating environmental benefits, including how the benefits  will be obtained, the schedule for these actions, and an estimate of the  quantifiable benefits that directly result from these actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual  benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/ yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall  manage and treat the facility waste as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each waste stream that contains benzene, including (but not  limited to) organic waste streams that contain less than 10 percent  water and aqueous waste streams, even if the wastes are not discharged  to an individual drain system, the owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remove or destroy the benzene contained in the waste using a  treatment process or wastewater treatment system that complies with the  standards specified in Sec. 61.348 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comply with the standards specified in Secs. 61.343 through  61.347 of this subpart for each waste management unit that receives or  manages the waste stream prior to and during treatment of the waste  stream in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each waste management unit used to manage or treat waste  streams that will be recycled to a process shall comply with the  standards specified in Secs. 61.343 through 61.347. Once the waste  stream is recycled to a process, including to a tank used for the  storage of production process feed, product, or   product intermediates, unless this tank is used primarily for the  storage of wastes, the material is no longer subject to paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> or  Sec. 61.355(c)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The waste stream is process wastewater that has a flow rate less  than 0.02 liters per minute (0.005 gallons per minute) or an annual  wastewater quantity of less than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator does not choose to exempt process  wastewater under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The total annual benzene quantity in all waste streams chosen  for exemption in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed  2.0 Mg/yr (2.2 ton/yr) as determined in the procedures in  Sec. 61.355(j), and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The total annual benzene quantity in a waste stream chosen for  exemption, including process unit turnaround waste, is determined for  the year in which the waste is generated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs  (c) and (e) of this section, an owner or operator of a facility at which  the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or  greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this  section may elect to manage and treat the facility waste as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall manage and treat process wastewater  in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each treated process wastewater stream identified in paragraph  (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be managed and treated in accordance  with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each untreated process wastewater stream identified in  paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is exempt from the requirements of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of this section, an owner or operator of a facility at which  the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or  greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this  section may elect to manage and treat the facility waste as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall manage and treat facility waste  (including remediation and process unit turnaround waste) with a flow- weighted annual average water content of 10 percent or greater, on a  volume basis as total water, and each waste stream that is mixed with  water or wastes at any time such that the resulting mixture has an  annual water content greater than 10 percent, in accordance with the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The benzene quantity for the wastes described in paragraph  (e)(2) of   this section must be equal to or less than 6.0 Mg/yr (6.6 ton/yr), as  determined in Sec. 61.355(k). Wastes as described in paragraph (e)(2) of  this section that are transferred offsite shall be included in the  determination of benzene quantity as provided in Sec. 61.355(k). The  provisions of paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply to any owner  or operator who elects to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The determination of benzene quantity for each waste stream  defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be made in accordance  with Sec. 61.355(k).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rather than treating the waste onsite, an owner or operator may  elect to comply with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by transferring  the waste offsite to another facility where the waste is treated in  accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.  The owner or operator transferring the waste shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comply with the standards specified in Secs. 61.343 through  61.347 of this subpart for each waste management unit that receives or  manages the waste prior to shipment of the waste offsite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include with each offsite waste shipment a notice stating that  the waste contains benzene which is required to be managed and treated  in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compliance with this subpart will be determined by review of  facility records and results from tests and inspections using methods  and procedures specified in Sec. 61.355 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Permission to use an alternative means of compliance to meet the  requirements of Secs. 61.342 through 61.352 of this subpart may be  granted by the Administrator as provided in Sec. 61.353 of this subpart.
