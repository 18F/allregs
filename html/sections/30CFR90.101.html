The applicable  standard is computed by dividing the percent of quartz into the number  10. The application of this formula shall not result in an applicable  standard that exceeds the standards specified in Sec. 90.100.</p><p class="depth2">Example: Assume the part 90 miner is on a 0.5 mg/m\3\ dust standard.  Suppose a valid representative dust sample with an equivalent  concentration of 0.50 mg/m\3\ contains 25.6% of quartz dust, which  corresponds to a quartz concentration of 128 [micro]g/m\3\. Therefore,  the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere  associated with that part 90 miner shall be maintained on each shift at  or below 0.4 mg/m\3\ (10/25.6% = 0.4 mg/m\3\).</p>
