The effect of a final  finding to this effect operates to release the employer/carrier from  liability of the expenses of such care. In addition to this, when such a  finding is made by the Director, the claimant receiving treatment will  be directed by the district director to seek authorization for medical  care from another source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For good cause shown, the Director may excuse the failure to  comply with the reporting requirements of the Act and further, may make  an award for the reasonable value of such medical care.
