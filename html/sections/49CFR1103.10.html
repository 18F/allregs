                            <p class="depth0">The following canons of ethics are adopted as a general guide for those admitted to practice before the Surface Transportation Board. The practitioners before the Board include (a) lawyers, who have been regularly admitted to practice law and (b) others who have fulfilled the requirements set forth in Sec.  1103.3. The former are bound by a broad code of ethics and unwritten rules of professional conduct which apply to every activity of a lawyer. The canons do not release the lawyer from any of the duties or principles of professional conduct by which lawyers are bound. They apply similarly to all practitioners before the Board, but do not negate the applicability of other ethical codes. The canons are organized under three headings, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Board, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Client, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to Other Litigants, Witnesses and the Public.</p><p class="depth0">The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities Toward the Board</p>
