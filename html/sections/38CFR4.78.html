                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Examination of muscle function. The examiner must use a Goldmann perimeter chart that identifies the four major quadrants (upward, downward, left and right lateral) and the central field (20 degrees or less) (see Figure 2). The examiner must chart the areas of diplopia and include the plotted chart with the examination report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of muscle function. (1) An evaluation for diplopia will be assigned to only one eye. When a claimant has both diplopia and decreased visual acuity or visual field defect, assign a level of corrected visual acuity for the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if disability of only one eye is service-connected) that is: one step poorer than it would otherwise warrant if the evaluation for diplopia under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/70 or 20/100; two steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/200 or 15/200; or three steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 5/200. This adjusted level of corrected visual acuity, however, must not exceed a level of 5/200. Use the adjusted visual acuity for the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if disability of only one eye is service-connected), and the corrected visual

acuity for the better eye (or visual acuity of 20/40 for the other eye, if only one eye is service-connected) to determine the percentage evaluation for visual impairment under diagnostic codes 6065 through 6066.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An evaluation for diplopia will be assigned to only one eye.
