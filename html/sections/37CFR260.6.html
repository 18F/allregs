                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes general rules pertaining to the verification of the payment of royalty fees to those parties entitled to receive such fees, according to terms promulgated by a duly appointed copyright arbitration royalty panel, under its authority to set reasonable terms and rates pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 114 and 801(b)(1), and the Librarian of Congress under his authority pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 802(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Frequency of verification. Interested parties may conduct a single audit of the entity making the royalty payment during any given calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of intent to audit. Interested parties must submit a notice of intent to audit the entity making the royalty payment with the Copyright Office, which shall publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing the receipt of the notice of intent to audit within 30 days of the filing of the interested parties' notice. Such notification of interest shall also be served at the same time on the party to be audited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of records. The interested party requesting the verification procedure shall retain the report of the verification for a period of three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acceptable verification procedure. An audit, including underlying paperwork, which was performed in the ordinary course of business according to generally accepted auditing standards by an independent auditor, shall serve as an acceptable verification procedure for all interested parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Costs of the verification procedure. The interested parties requesting the verification procedure shall pay for the cost of the verification procedure, unless an independent auditor concludes that there was an underpayment of five (5) percent or more, in which case, the entity which made the underpayment shall bear the costs of the verification procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interested parties. For purposes of this section, interested parties are those who are entitled to receive royalty payments pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2), or their designated agents.
