                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 45 calendar days of the date on which FHFA first appoints  an Independent Director pursuant to Sec. 1273.7(c) of this part, the OF  board of directors as structured under this part shall hold an  organizational meeting. At the time of such meeting, the OF board of  directors and its Audit Committee shall be deemed to be reconstituted in  accordance with this part, and, except as set forth in paragraph (c) of  this section, shall thereafter operate in accordance with this part. The  date of this organizational meeting shall be set by the Independent  Director that has been appointed as Chairman of the OF board of  directors by FHFA pursuant to Sec. 1273.7(e) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Until the date of the organizational meeting required by  paragraph (a) of this section, the board of directors of OF, and audit  committee thereof, as in existence immediately prior to the effective  date of this rule, shall continue to have power and authority to act as  the OF board of directors or audit committee thereof, as applicable.  Further, the board members who served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the OF  board immediately prior to the effective date of this rule shall  continue also to serve in these capacities until the date of the  organizational meeting required under paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Further, the audit committee as in existence immediately prior  to the effective date of this rule shall continue to have responsibility  and oversight authority with regard to the preparation and publication  of the combined financial report for any reporting period that ends  prior to July 1, 2010, unless the board of directors established under  this part determines that the Audit Committee as established under this  part should be given such responsibility.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 1273--Exceptions to the General Disclosure</p><p class="depth2">Standards</p><p class="depth2">A. Related-party transactions. Item 404 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR  229.404, requires the disclosure of certain relationships and related  party transactions. In light of the cooperative nature of the Bank  System, related-party transactions are to be expected, and a disclosure  of all related-party transactions that meet the threshold would not be  meaningful. Instead, the combined annual report will disclose the  percent of advances to members an officer of which serves as a Bank  director, and list the top ten holders of advances in the Bank System  and the top five holders of advances by Bank, with a further disclosure  indicating which of these members had an officer that served as a Bank  director. The combined financial report will also disclose the top ten  holders of advances in the Bank System by holding company, where the  advances of all affiliates within a holding company are aggregated.</p><p class="depth2">B. Biographical information. The biographical information required  by Items 401 and 405 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.401 and 405, will be  provided only for members of the OF board of directors, including the  Bank presidents, the Chair and Vice-Chair of the board of directors of  each Bank, and the Chief Executive Officer of OF.</p><p class="depth2">C. Compensation. The information on compensation required by Item  402 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.402, will be provided only for Bank  presidents and the CEO of the OF. Since stock in each Bank trades at  par, the OF will not include the performance graph specified in Item  402(1) of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.402(1).</p><p class="depth2">D. Submission of matters to a vote of stockholders. No information  will be presented on matters submitted to shareholders for a vote, as  otherwise required by Item 4 of the SEC's form 10-K, 17 CFR 249.310. The  only item shareholders vote upon is the annual election of directors.</p><p class="depth2">E. Exhibits. The exhibits required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K, 17  CFR 229.601, are not applicable and will not be provided.</p><p class="depth2">F. Per share information. The statement of financial information  required by Items 301 and 302 of Rule S-K, 17 CFR 229.301 and 302, is  inapplicable because the shares of the Banks are subscription capital  that trades at par, and the shares expand or contract with changes in  member assets or advance levels.</p><p class="depth2">G. Beneficial ownership. Item 403 of Rule S-K, 17 CFR 229.403,  requires the disclosure of   security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management. The  combined financial report will provide a listing of the ten largest  holders of capital stock in the Bank System and a listing of the five  largest holders of capital stock by Bank. This listing will also  indicate which members had an officer that served as a director of a  Bank. The combined financial report will also disclose the top ten  holders of Bank stock in the Bank System by holding company, where the  Bank stock of all affiliates within a holding company is aggregated.</p>
