                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Entry for immediate transportation without appraisement may be made under section 552, Tariff Act of 1930, (1) for any merchandise, except explosives and prohibited merchandise, upon its arrival at a port of entry, or (2) for merchandise in general-order warehouse at any time within 6 months from the date of importation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Entry for immediate transportation without appraisement may be made by (1) the carrier bringing the merchandise to the port of arrival, (2) the carrier who is to accept the merchandise under its bond or a carnet for transportation to the port of destination, or (3) any person shown by the bill of lading or manifest, a certificate of the importing carrier, or by any other document satisfactory to the port director, to have a sufficient interest in the merchandise for that purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before a shipment covered by an entry for immediate transportation, including a carnet, or a manifest of baggage shipped in bond (other than baggage to be forwarded in bond to a Customs station--see Sec. 18.13(a)), shall be allowed to be transported directly to a place of deposit outside a port of entry for examination and release as contemplated by section 484(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the consent of the director of the port of entry designated in the transportation entry or baggage manifest (or in the event of diversion under Sec. 18.5, for the port of destination of the merchandise or baggage) must first be secured. Before consent may be given, the importer must furnish such port director with a stipulation that, promptly upon the arrival of any part of the merchandise or baggage at the place of deposit, he will file an entry for the shipment at the port of entry designated in the transportation entry or baggage manifest (or in the event of

diversion under Sec. 18.5, at the port of destination of the merchandise or baggage) and will comply with the provisions of Sec. 151.9 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carload shipments of livestock shall not be entered for immediate transportation without appraisement unless they will arrive at destination before it becomes necessary to remove the seals for the purpose of watering and feeding the animals, or unless the route be such that the removal of the seals and the watering, feeding, and reloading of the stock may be done under Customs supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Entries for immediate transportation without appraisement covering merchandise subject to detention or supervision by any Federal agency must contain a sufficient description of the merchandise to enable the representative of the agency concerned to determine the contents of the shipment. Such merchandise covered by quarantines and regulations administered by the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine shall be forwarded under such entries only upon written permission of or under regulations issued by that Bureau. Entries for immediate transportation without appraisement covering textiles and textile products subject to section 204, Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), must be described in such detail as to enable the port director to estimate the duties and taxes, if any, due. The port director may require evidence to satisfy him of the approximate correctness of the value and quantity stated in the entry (e.g. Detailed quantity description, 14 cartons, 2 dozen per carton); Detailed description of the textiles or textile products including type of commodity and chief fiber content (e.g., men's cotton jeans or women's wool sweaters); Net weight of the textiles or textile products (including immediate packing but excluding pallet); Total value of the textiles or textile products; Manufacturer or supplier; Country of orgin; Name(s) and address(es) of the person(s) to whom the textiles and textile products are consigned; Harmonized code tariff number (when available).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> One or more entire packages of merchandise covered by an invoice from one consignor to one consignee may be entered for consumption or warehouse at the port of first arrival, and the remainder entered for immediate transportation without appraisement, provided all the merchandise covered by the invoice is entered simultaneously and any carnet which may cover such merchandise is discharged as to that merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Several importations may be consolidated in one immediate transportation without appraisement entry when bills of lading or carrier's certificates name only one consignee at the port of first arrival. However, merchandise moving under cover of a carnet may not be consolidated with other merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Either Customs Form 7512, a carnet, or an air waybill (see Sec. 122.92 of this chapter), shall be used as a combined transportation entry, invoice, and manifest. If Customs Form 7512 is used, a minimum of three copies shall be required at the port of origin. The port director, however, may require additional copies of Customs Form 7512 or the Goods Manifest of the carnet for use in connection with the delivery of the merchandise to the bonded carrier. In lieu of additional copies of the Goods Manifest, the port director may accept copies of a bill of lading covering the merchandise. The merchandise shall be described in such detail as to enable the port director to estimate the duties and taxes, if any, due. The port director may require evidence to satisfy him of the approximate correctness of the value or quantity stated in the entry. If a TIR carnet is used, and the duties and taxes estimated to be due exceed the maximum liability of the guaranteeing association under the carnet, the provisions of Sec. 114.22(d) of this chapter shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The value stated on the entry at the port of first arrival is not binding on the ultimate consignee making entry at the port of destination and

does not relieve the importer of the obligation to show the correct value on entry.
