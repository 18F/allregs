The  responsible official shall conduct a preliminary environmental review of  each action, including consideration of the potential direct and  reasonably foreseeable indirect effects of a proposed action on the  Antarctic environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, on the basis of the preliminary environmental review, the  responsible official determines that an action will have less than a  minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, he will prepare  an Environmental Action Memorandum briefly summarizing the environmental  issues considered and conclusions drawn from the review. No further  environmental review shall be necessary.</p>
