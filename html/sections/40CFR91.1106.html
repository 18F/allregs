                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Violations. A violation of the requirements of this subpart is a  violation of the applicable provisions of the Act, including sections  203 and 213(d), and is subject to the penalty provisions thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (a)(4), or (a)(5), or  a manufacturer or dealer who violates Sec. 91.1103(a)(3)(i), is subject  to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 for each violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates  Sec. 91.1103(a)(3)(i) or any person who violates Sec. 91.1103(a)(3)(ii)  is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each  violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em>,  (a)(4), or (a)(5) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each  marine SI engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A violation with respect to Sec. 91.1103(a)(3)(ii) constitutes a  separate offense with respect to each part or component. Each day of a  violation with respect to Sec. 91.1103(a)(6) constitutes a separate  offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A person who violates Sec. 91.1103 (a)(2) or (a)(6) is subject  to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 per day of violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The maximum penalty values listed in this section are shown for  calendar year 2004. Maximum penalty limits for later years may be  adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The specific regulatory  provisions for changing the maximum penalties, published in 40 CFR part  19, reference the applicable U.S. Code citation on which the prohibited  action is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Civil actions. The Administrator may commence a civil action to  assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district  court of the United States for the district in which the violation is  alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant resides or has the  Administrator's principal place of business, and the court shall have  jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed  under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of  the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from  the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's  history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy  the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to  continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to  attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative assessment of certain penalties--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action  under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator shall assess any  civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that  the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty  assessment proceeding can not exceed $270,000, unless the Administrator  and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a  larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty  assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney  General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty  is made by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing  held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter.  The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions,  any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determining amount. In determining the amount of any civil  penalty assessed under this subsection, the Administrator is to take  into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or  savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the  violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II  of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the  penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such  other matters as justice may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect of administrator's action. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Action by the  Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the  Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of this part; except  that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced  and is diligently prosecuting an action under this part, or for which  the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further  judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment  under this part may not be the subject of a civil penalty action under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No action by the Administrator under this part affects a  person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Finality of order. An order issued under this subsection is to  become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial  review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Judicial review. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person against whom a civil penalty is  assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the  assessment in the United States District Court for the District of  Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have  occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principle  place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the  date a civil penalty order is issued. The person must simultaneously  send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the  Attorney General.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator must file in the court within 30 days a  certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on  which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any  order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph  unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a  whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the  Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of  discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties  unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an  abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to  recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Collection. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any person fails to pay an assessment of a  civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part  after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court  in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered  a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator is to  request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate  district court to recover the amount   assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section  6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the  final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such  an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is  not subject to review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an  assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of  this section is required to pay, in addition to that amount and  interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's  fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment  penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The  nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate  amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are  unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.
