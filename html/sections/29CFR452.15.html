                            <p class="depth0">Establishment of a valid trusteeship may have the effect of  suspending the operation of the election provisions of the Act. When the  autonomy otherwise available to a subordinate labor organization has  been suspended consistent with the provisions of title III of the Act,  officers of the organization under trusteeship may be relieved of their  duties and temporary officers appointed by the trustee if necessary to  assist him in carrying out the purposes for which the trusteeship was  established. However, when a regular election of officers or an election  for purposes of terminating the trusteeship is being held during the  trusteeship, title IV would apply.</p>
