Before establishing, renewing, or reestablishing a discretionary advisory committee and filing the charter as addressed later in Sec. 102-3.70, the agency head must consult with the Secretariat. As part of this consultation, agency heads are encouraged to engage in constructive dialogue with the Secretariat. With a full understanding of the background and purpose behind the proposed advisory committee, the Secretariat may share its knowledge and experience with the agency on how best to make use of the proposed advisory committee, suggest alternate methods of attaining its purpose that the agency may wish to consider, or inform the agency of a pre-existing advisory committee performing similar functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Include required information in the consultation. Consultations covering the establishment, renewal, and reestablishment of advisory committees must, as a minimum, contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Explanation of need. An explanation stating why the advisory committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and in the public interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lack of duplication of resources. An explanation stating why the advisory committee's functions cannot be performed by the agency, another existing committee, or other means such as a public hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fairly balanced membership. A description of the agency's plan to attain fairly balanced membership. The plan will ensure that, in the selection of members for the advisory committee, the agency will consider a cross-section of those directly affected, interested, and qualified, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the advisory committee. Advisory committees requiring technical expertise should include persons with demonstrated professional or personal qualifications and experience relevant to the functions and tasks to be performed.</p>
