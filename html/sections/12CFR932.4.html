class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When determining the applicable credit risk percentage requirement from Tables 1.2 or 1.3 of this part, each Bank shall apply the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For assets or items that are rated directly by an NRSRO, the credit rating shall be the NRSRO's credit rating for the asset or item as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When using Table 1.3 of this part, for an asset, off-balance sheet item, or derivative contract that is not rated directly by an NRSRO, but for which an NRSRO rating has been assigned to any corresponding obligor counterparty, third party guarantor, or collateral backing the asset, item, or derivative, the credit rating that shall apply to the asset, item, or derivative, or portion of the asset, item, or derivative so guaranteed or collateralized, shall be the credit rating corresponding to such obligor counterparty, third party guarantor, or underlying collateral, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. If there are multiple obligor counterparties, third party guarantors, or collateral instruments backing an asset, item, or derivative not rated directly by an NRSRO, or any specific portion thereof, then the credit rating that shall apply to that asset, item, or derivative or specific portion thereof, shall be the highest credit rating among such obligor counterparties, third party guarantors, or collateral instruments, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. Assets, items or derivatives shall be deemed to be backed by collateral for purposes of this paragraph if the collateral is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Actually held by the Bank or an independent, third-party custodian, or, if permitted under the Bank's collateral agreement with such party, by the Bank's member or an affiliate of that member where the term ``affiliate'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 950.1 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legally available to absorb losses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Of a readily determinable value at which it can be liquidated by the Bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Held in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's member products policy established pursuant to Sec. 917.4 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subject to an appropriate discount to protect against price decline during the holding period, as well as the costs likely to be incurred in the liquidation of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When using Table 1.3 of this part, for an asset with a short-term credit rating from a given NRSRO, the credit risk percentage requirement shall be based on the remaining maturity of the asset and the long-term credit rating provided for the issuer of the asset by the same NRSRO. Should the issuer of the short-term asset not have a long-term credit rating, the long-term equivalent rating shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The highest short-term credit rating shall be equivalent to the third highest long-term rating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The second highest short-term rating shall be equivalent to the fourth highest long-term rating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The third highest short-term rating shall be equivalent to the fourth highest long-term rating; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the short-term rating is downgraded to below investment grade after acquisition by the Bank, the short-term rating shall be equivalent to the second highest below investment grade long-term rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For residential mortgage assets and other assets or items, or relevant portion of an asset or item, that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(B) or (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, and are not identified in Tables 1.1 or Table 1.4 of this part, each Bank shall determine its own credit rating for such assets or items, or relevant portion thereof, using credit rating standards available from an NRSRO or other similar standards. This credit rating, as determined by the Bank, shall be used to identify the applicable credit risk percentage requirement under Table 1.2 of this part for residential mortgage assets, or under Table 1.3 of this part for all other assets or items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The credit risk percentage requirement for mortgage assets that are acquired member assets described in Sec. 955.2 of this chapter shall be assigned from Table 1.2 of this part based on the rating of those assets after taking into account any credit enhancement required by Sec. 955.3 of this chapter. Should a Bank further enhance a pool of loans through the purchase of insurance or by some other means, the credit risk percentage requirement shall be based on the rating of such pool after the supplemental credit enhancement, except that the Finance Board retains the right to adjust the credit capital charge to account for any deficiencies with the supplemental enhancement on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the credit ratings under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, each Bank shall apply the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The most recent credit rating from a given NRSRO shall be considered. If only one NRSRO has rated an asset or item, that NRSRO's rating shall be used. If an asset or item has received credit ratings from more than one NRSRO, the lowest credit rating from among those NRSROs shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where a credit rating has a modifier (e.g., A-1 + for short-term ratings and A + or A- for long-term ratings) the credit rating is deemed to be the credit rating without the modifier (e.g., A-1 + = A-1 and A + or A-= A);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Calculation of credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet items--(1) General requirement. The credit equivalent amount for an off-balance sheet item shall be determined by a Finance Board approved model or shall be equal to the face amount of the instrument multiplied by the credit conversion factor assigned to such risk category of instruments, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided in the following Table 2 of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Table 2--Credit Conversion Factors for Off-Balance Sheet Items------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Credit</p><p class="depth0">conversion</p><p class="depth0">Instrument                           factor (In</p><p class="depth0">percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------Asset sales with recourse where the credit risk remains              100</p><p class="depth0">with the Bank..........................................Commitments to make advances subject to certain drawdownCommitments to acquire loans subject to certain drawdownStandby letters of credit...............................              50Other commitments with original maturity of over one</p><p class="depth0">year...................................................Other commitments with original maturity of one year or               20</p><p class="depth0">less...................................................------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The credit conversion factor shall be zero for Other Commitments With Original Maturity of Over One Year and Other Commitments With Original Maturity of One Year or Less, for which credit conversion factors of 50 percent or 20 percent would otherwise apply, that are unconditionally cancelable, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation, due to the deterioration in a borrower's creditworthiness, at any time by the Bank without prior notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Calculation of current and potential future credit exposures for single derivative contracts--(1) Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure for a derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the mark-to-market value of the contract is positive, the mark-to-market value of the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the mark-to-market value of the contract is zero or negative, zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Potential future credit exposure. (i) The potential future credit exposure

for a single derivative contract, including a derivative contract with a negative mark-to-market value, shall be calculated using an internal model approved by the Finance Board or, in the alternative, by multiplying the effective notional amount of the derivative contract by one of the assigned credit conversion factors, modified as may be required by paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, for the appropriate category as provided in the following Table 3 of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Credit Conversion Factors for Potential Future Credit Exposure Derivative Contracts</p><p class="depth0">[In percent]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Foreign                   Precious</p><p class="depth0">Residual maturity                  Interest    exchange and     Equity       metals       Other</p><p class="depth0">rate          gold                   except gold  commodities----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One year or less.............................           0             1              6            7           10Over 1 year to five years....................            .5           5              8            7           12Over five years..............................           1.5           7.5           10            8           15----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In applying the credit conversion factors in Table 3 of this part the following modifications shall be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For derivative contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factors are multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the derivative contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For derivative contracts that automatically reset to zero value following a payment, the residual maturity equals the time until the next payment; however, interest rate contracts with remaining maturities of greater than one year shall be subject to a minimum conversion factor of 0.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a Bank uses an internal model to determine the potential future credit exposure for a particular type of derivative contract, the Bank shall use the same model for all other similar types of contracts. However, the Bank may use an internal model for one type of derivative contract and Table 3 of this part for another type of derivative contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Forwards, swaps, purchased options and similar derivative contracts not included in the Interest Rate, Foreign Exchange and Gold, Equity, or Precious Metals Except Gold categories shall be treated as other commodities contracts when determining potential future credit exposures using Table 3 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If a Bank uses Table 3 of this part to determine the potential future credit exposures for credit derivative contracts, the credit conversion factors provided in Table 3 for equity contracts shall also apply to the credit derivative contracts entered into with investment grade counterparties.

The current credit exposure for multiple derivative contracts executed with a single counterparty and subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, shall be calculated on a net basis and shall equal:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The net sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual derivative contracts subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract, if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Zero, if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Potential future credit exposure. The potential future credit exposure for each individual derivative contract from among a group of derivative contracts that are executed with a single counterparty and subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section shall be calculated as follows:

The credit risk capital charge for an asset hedged with a credit derivative in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section shall equal the sum of the credit risk capital charges for the hedged and unhedged portion of the asset provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The remaining maturity for the credit derivative is less than the remaining maturity for the hedged asset and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The asset referenced in the credit derivative is identical to the hedged asset; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The asset referenced in the credit derivative is different from the hedged asset, but only if the asset referenced in the credit derivative and the hedged asset have been issued by the same obligor, the asset referenced in the credit derivative ranks pari passu to or more junior than the hedged asset and has the same maturity as the hedged asset, and cross-default clauses apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The credit risk capital charge for the unhedged portion of the asset equals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The credit risk capital charge for the hedged asset, calculated as the book value of the hedged asset multiplied by the hedged asset's credit risk percentage requirement assigned pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section where the appropriate credit rating is that for the hedged asset and the appropriate maturity is the remaining maturity of the hedged asset; minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The credit risk capital charge for the hedged asset, calculated as the book value of the hedged asset multiplied by the hedged asset's credit risk percentage requirement assigned pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section where the appropriate credit rating is that for the hedged asset but the appropriate maturity is deemed to be the remaining maturity of the credit derivative; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The credit risk capital charge for the hedged portion of the asset is equal to the credit risk capital charge for the credit derivative, calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Zero Credit risk capital charge for certain derivative contracts. The credit risk capital charge for the following derivative contracts shall be zero:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A foreign exchange rate contract with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less (gold contracts do not qualify for this exception); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A derivative contract that is traded on an organized exchange requiring the daily payment of any variations in the market value of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Date of calculations. Unless otherwise directed by the Finance Board, each Bank shall perform all calculations required by this section using the assets, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts held by the Bank, and, if applicable, the values or credit ratings of such assets, items, or derivatives as of the close of business of the last business day of the month for which the credit risk capital charge is being calculated.
