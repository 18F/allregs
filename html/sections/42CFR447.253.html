                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State assurances. In order to receive CMS approval of a State plan change in payment methods and standards, the Medicaid agency must make assurances satisfactory to CMS that the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section are being met, must submit the related information required by Sec.  447.255 of this subpart, and must comply with all other requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Findings. Whenever the Medicaid agency makes a change in its methods and standards, but not less often than annually, the agency must make the following findings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payment rates. (i) The Medicaid agency pays for inpatient hospital services and long-term care facility services through the use of rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated providers to provide services in conformity with applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to inpatient hospital services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The methods and standards used to determine payment rates take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number

of low income patients with special needs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a State elects in its State plan to cover inappropriate level of care services (that is, services furnished to hospital inpatients who require a lower covered level of care such as skilled nursing or intermediate care services) under conditions similar to those described in section 1861(v)(1)(G) of the Act, the methods and standards used to determine payment rates must specify that the payments for this type of care must be made at rates lower than those for inpatient hospital level of care services, reflecting the level of care actually received, in a manner consistent with section 1861(v)(1)(G) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The payment rates are adequate to assure that beneficiaries have reasonable access, taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time, to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to nursing facility services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except for preadmission screening for individuals with mental illness and Intellectual Disability under Sec.  483.20(f) of this Chapter, the methods and standards used to determine payment rates take into account the costs of complying with the requirements of part 483 subpart B of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The methods and standards used to determine payment rates provide for an appropriate reduction to take into account the lower costs (if any) of the facility for nursing care under a waiver of the requirement in Sec.  483.30(c) of this Chapter to provide licensed nurses on a 24-hour basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The State establishes procedures under which the data and methodology used in establishing payment rates are made available to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upper payment limits. The agency's proposed payment rate will not exceed the upper payment limits as specified in Sec.  447.272.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes in ownership of hospitals. In determining payment when there has been a sale or transfer of the assets of a hospital, the State's methods and standards must provide that payment rates can reasonably be expected not to increase in the aggregate solely as a result of changes of ownership, more than the payments would increase under Medicare under Sec. Sec.  413.130, 413.134, 413.153, and 413.157 of this chapter, insofar as these sections affect payments for depreciation, interest on capital indebtedness, return on equity capital (if applicable), acquisition costs for which payments were previously made to prior owners, and the recapture of depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in ownership of NFs and ICFs/IID. In determining payment when there has been a sale or transfer of assets of an NF or ICF/IID, the State's methods and standards must provide the following depending upon the date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For transfers on or after July 18, 1984 but before October 1, 1985, the State's methods and standards must provide that payment rates can reasonably be expected not to increase in the aggregate, solely as the result of a change in ownership, more than payments would increase under Medicare under Sec. Sec.  413.130, 413.134, 413.153 and 413.157 of this chapter, insofar as these sections affect payment for depreciation, interest on capital indebtedness, return on equity capital (if applicable), acquisition costs for which payments were previously made to prior owners, and the recapture of depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For transfers on or after October 1, 1985, the State's methods and standards must provide that the valuation of capital assets for purposes of determining payment rates for NFs and ICFs/IID is not to increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership) solely as a result of a change of ownership, by more than the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One-half of the percentage increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership, or, if necessary, as extrapolated retrospectively by the Secretary) in the Dodge construction index applied in the aggregate with respect to those facilities that have undergone a change of ownership during the fiscal year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One-half of the percentage increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of

the change of ownership) in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) (United States city average) applied in the aggregate with respect to those facilities that have undergone a change of ownership during the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Provider appeals. The Medicaid agency must provide an appeals or exception procedure that allows individual providers an opportunity to submit additional evidence and receive prompt administrative review, with respect to such issues as the agency determines appropriate, of payment rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Uniform cost reporting. The Medicaid agency must provide for the filing of uniform cost reports by each participating provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Audit requirements. The Medicaid agency must provide for periodic audits of the financial and statistical records of participating providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Public notice. The Medicaid agency must provide that it has complied with the public notice requirements in Sec.  447.205 of this part when it is proposing significant changes to its methods or standards for setting payment rates for inpatient hospital or LTC facility services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rates paid. The Medicaid agency must pay for inpatient hospital and long term care services using rates determined in accordance with methods and standards specified in an approved State plan.
