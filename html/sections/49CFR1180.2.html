                            <p class="depth0">Transactions proposed under 49 U.S.C. 11323 involving more than one common carrier by railroad are of four types: Major, significant, minor, and exempt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A major transaction is a control or merger involving two or more class I railroads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A significant transaction is a transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads that is of regional or national transportation significance as that phrase is used in 49 U.S.C. 11325(a)(2) and (c). A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more

class I railroads is not significant if a determination can be made either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the transaction clearly will not have any anticompetitive effects, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That any anticompetitive effects of the transaction will clearly be outweighed by the transaction's anticipated contribution to the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</p><p class="depth3">A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads is significant if neither such determination can clearly be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A minor transaction is one which involves more than one railroad and which is not a major, significant, or exempt transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A transaction is exempt if it is within one of the eight categories described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8). The Board has found that its prior review and approval of these transactions is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and is of limited scope or unnecessary to protect shippers from market abuse. See 49 U.S.C. 10502. A notice must be filed to use one of these class exemptions. The procedures are set out in Sec.  1180.4(g). These class exemptions do not relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests of employees. See 49 U.S.C. 10502(g) and 11326. The enumeration of the following categories of transactions as exempt does not preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of specific transactions not falling into these categories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquisition of a line of railroad which would not constitute a major market extension where the Board has found that the public convenience and necessity permit abandonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition or continuance in control of a nonconnecting carrier or one of its lines where (i) the railroads would not connect with each other or any railroads in their corporate family, (ii) the acquisition or continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family, and (iii) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transactions within a corporate family that do not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Renewal of leases and any other matters where the Board has previously authorized the transaction, and only an extension in time is involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Joint projects involving the relocation of a line of railroad which does not disrupt service to shippers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reincorporation in a different State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Acquisition of trackage rights and renewal of trackage rights by a rail carrier over lines owned or operated by any other rail carrier or carriers that are: (i) based on written agreements, and (ii) not filed or sought in responsive applications in rail consolidation proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Acquisition of temporary trackage rights by a rail carrier over lines owned or operated by any other rail carrier or carriers that are: (i) based on written agreements, (ii) not filed or sought in responsive applications in rail consolidation proceedings, (iii) for overhead operations only, and (iv) scheduled to expire on a specific date not to exceed 1 year from the effective date of the exemption. If the operations contemplated by the exemption will not be concluded within the 1-year period, the parties may, prior to expiration of the period, file a request for a renewal of the temporary rights for an additional period of up to 1 year, including the reason(s) therefor. Rail carriers acquiring temporary trackage rights need not seek authority from the Board to discontinue the trackage rights as of the expiration date specified under 49 CFR 1180.4(g)(2)(iii). All transactions under these rules will be subject to applicable statutory labor protective conditions.
