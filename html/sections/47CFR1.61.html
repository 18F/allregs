The owner remains responsible for providing a copy of FCC  Form 854R to all tenant licensees on the structure and for posting the  registration number as required by Sec. 17.4(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of FCC Form 854, and attached FAA final  determination of ``no hazard,'' the Bureau may prescribe antenna  structure painting and/or lighting specifications or other conditions in  accordance with the FAA airspace recommendation. Unless otherwise  specified by the Bureau, the antenna structure must conform to the FAA's  painting and lighting recommendations set forth in the FAA's  determination of ``no hazard'' and the associated FAA study number. The  Bureau returns a completed Antenna Structure Registration (FCC Form  854R) to the registrant. If the proposed structure is disapproved the  registrant is so advised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each operating Bureau or Office examines the applications for  Commission authorization for which it is responsible to ensure  compliance with FAA notification procedures as well as Commission  Antenna Structure Registration as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If Antenna Structure Registration is required, the operating  Bureau reviews the application for the Antenna Structure Registration  Number and proceeds as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the application contains the Antenna Structure Registration  Number or if the applicant seeks a Cellular or PCS system authorization,  the operating Bureau processes the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure  Registration Number, but the structure owner has already filed FCC Form  854, the operating Bureau places the application on hold until  Registration can be confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due  diligence in filing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the application does not contain the Antenna Structure  Registration Number, and the structure owner has not filed FCC Form 854,  the operating Bureau notifies the applicant that FCC Form 854 must be  filed and places the application on hold until Registration can be  confirmed, so long as the owner exhibits due diligence in filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If Antenna Structure Registration is not required, the operating  Bureau processes the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where one or more antenna farm areas have been designated for a  community or communities (see Sec. 17.9 of this chapter), an application  proposing the erection of an antenna structure over 1,000 feet in height  above ground to serve such community or communities will not be accepted  for filing unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is proposed to locate the antenna structure in a designated  antenna farm area, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is accompanied by a statement from the Federal Aviation  Administration that the proposed structure will not constitute a menace  to air navigation, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is accompanied by a request for waiver setting forth reasons  sufficient, if true, to justify such a waiver.</p><p class="depth3">Note: By Commission Order (FCC 65-455), 30 FR 7419, June 5, 1965,  the Commission issued the following policy statement concerning the  height of radio and television antenna towers: ``We have concluded that this objective can best be achieved by adopting  the following policy: Applications for antenna towers higher than 2,000  feet above ground will be presumed to be inconsistent with the public  interest, and the applicant will have a burden of overcoming that strong  presumption. The applicant must accompany its application with a  detailed showing directed to meeting this burden. Only in the  exceptional case, where the Commission concludes that a clear and  compelling showing has been made that there are public interest reasons  requiring a tower higher than 2,000 feet above ground, and after the  parties have complied with applicable FAA procedures, and full  Commission coordination with FAA on the question of menace to air  navigation, will a grant be made. Applicants and parties in interest  will, of course, be afforded their statutory hearing rights.''
