Operators may begin operating immediately upon the filing of the necessary information (plus three copies). Although the designated operator will not be required to seek and obtain authority from the Board either to commence or to terminate operations, the designated operator is a common carrier by railroad subject to all other applicable provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV. However, we have exempted designated operators from some aspects of regulation. See Exemption of Certain Designated Operators from Section 11343, 361 ICC 379 (1979), as modified by McGinness v. I.C.C., 662 F.2d 853 (D.C. Cir. 1981).
