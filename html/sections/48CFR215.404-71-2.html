                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. This profit factor addresses the contractor's  degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The factor  consists of two parts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Technical--the technical uncertainties of performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Management/cost control--the degree of management effort  necessary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To ensure that contract requirements are met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To reduce and control costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 is  annotated to describe the process.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Assigned                                         Profit</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>             (2)             N/A             N/A 22................

The standard designated range should apply to most  contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Technology incentive. For the technical factor only, contracting  officers may use the technology incentive range for acquisitions that  include development, production, or application of innovative new  technologies. The technology incentive range does not apply to efforts  restricted to studies, analyses, or demonstrations that have a technical  report as their primary deliverable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation criteria for technical. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review the contract  requirements and focus on the critical performance elements in the  statement of work or specifications. Factors to consider include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Technology being applied or developed by the contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Technical complexity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Program maturity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Performance specifications and tolerances;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Delivery schedule; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Extent of a warranty or guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Above normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a higher than normal value in those cases where there is a substantial  technical risk. Indicators are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent  tolerance limits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use  of state-of-the-art machinery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to  the Government and must be performed to exacting standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The contractor's independent development and investment has  reduced the Government's risk or cost;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to  meet DoD requirements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty  provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult  technical obstacles that require personnel with exceptional abilities,  experience, and professional credentials may justify a value  significantly above normal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following may justify a maximum value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if  performance or quality specifications are tight; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A high degree of development or production concurrency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Below normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a lower than normal value in those cases where the technical risk is  low.

Use the technology incentive range only for the most  innovative contract efforts. Innovation may be in the form of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Development or application of new technology that fundamentally  changes the characteristics of an existing product or system and that  results in increased technical performance,   improved reliability, or reduced costs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> New products or systems that contain significant technological  advances over the products or systems they are replacing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When selecting a value within the technology incentive range,  the contracting officer should consider the relative value of the  proposed innovation to the acquisition as a whole. When the innovation  represents a minor benefit, the contracting officer should consider  using values less than the norm. For innovative efforts that will have a  major positive impact on the product or program, the contracting officer  may use values above the norm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Evaluation criteria for management/cost control. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  contracting officer should evaluate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contractor's management and internal control systems using  contracting office data, information and reviews made by field contract  administration offices or other DoD field offices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The management involvement expected on the prospective contract  action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The degree of cost mix as an indication of the types of  resources applied and value added by the contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The contractor's support of Federal socioeconomic programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The expected reliability of the contractor's cost estimates  (including the contractor's cost estimating system);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The adequacy of the contractor's management approach to  controlling cost and schedule; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any other factors that affect the contractor's ability to meet  the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates and inflation  rates).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Above normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a higher than normal value when there is a high degree of management  effort. Indicators of this are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contractor's value added is both considerable and reasonably  difficult;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The effort involves a high degree of integration or  coordination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The contractor has a good record of past performance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The contractor has a substantial record of active participation  in Federal socioeconomic programs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost  estimates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy decisions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the  effort--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Involves major international activities with significant  management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign vendors); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has critically important milestones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Below normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a lower than normal value when the management effort is minimal.
