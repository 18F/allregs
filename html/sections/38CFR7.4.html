payment in excess of $10,000 or if liability for such benefits is excluded or restricted by military service or any activity which the insured may be called upon to perform in connection with military service. In the event that premiums for the primary and additional benefits are not separable under the terms of the policy the entire policy will be guaranteed, if the policy is otherwise eligible for protection under the law.
