                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Audits and investigations are official actions involving the  examination of books, records, documents, other writings and information  to ensure that the provisions of the Defense Production Act, the  Selective Service Act and related statutes, and this part have been  properly followed. An audit or investigation may also include interviews  and a systems evaluation to detect problems or failures in the  implementation of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When undertaking an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, the  Department of Commerce shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the  person under investigation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have ascertained that the information sought or other adequate  and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other  responsible agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In administering this part, the Department of Commerce may issue  the following documents, which constitute official actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administrative subpoenas. An administrative subpoena requires a  person to appear as a witness before an official designated by the  Department of Commerce to testify under oath on matters of which that  person has knowledge relating to the enforcement or the administration  of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related  statutes, or this part. An administrative subpoena may also require the  production of books, papers, records, documents and physical objects or  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demand for information. A demand for information requires a  person to furnish to a duly authorized representative of the Department  of Commerce any information necessary or appropriate to the enforcement  or the administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective  Service Act, or this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection authorizations. An inspection authorization requires  a person to permit a duly authorized representative of the Department of  Commerce to interview the person's employees or agents, to inspect  books, records, documents, other writings and information in the  person's possession or control at the place where that person usually  keeps them, and to inspect a person's property when such interviews and  inspections are necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the  administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act,  or this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The production of books, records, documents, other writings and  information will not be required at any place other than where they are  usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the  administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized  official of the Department of Commerce is furnished with copies of such  material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an  alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly  authorized official of the Department of Commerce as to the content of  the material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or  inspection authorization shall include the name, title or official  position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced,  and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit,  investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be  interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or  information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the  administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection  authorization will describe them with particularity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service of documents shall be made in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service of a demand for information or inspection authorization  shall be made personally, or by certified mail--return receipt requested  at the person's last known address. Service of an administrative  subpoena shall be made personally. Personal service may also be made by  leaving a copy of the document with someone at least 18   years of age at the person's last known dwelling or place of business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a  partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by  appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is  served, a copy of the document shall be mailed to the person named in  the document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any individual 18 years of age or older may serve an  administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection  authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the  service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was  made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit,  and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing  officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure  shall be stated on the original document.  [79 FR 47570, Aug. 14, 2014]</p>
