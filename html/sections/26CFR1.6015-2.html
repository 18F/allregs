                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A requesting spouse may be relieved of joint and  several liability for tax (including additions to tax, penalties, and  interest) from an understatement for a taxable year under this section  if the requesting spouse elects the application of this section in  accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.6015-1(h)(5) and 1.6015-5, and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A joint return was filed for the taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the return there is an understatement attributable to  erroneous items of the nonrequesting spouse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requesting spouse establishes that in signing the return he  or she did not know and had no reason to know of the understatement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is inequitable to hold the requesting spouse liable for the  deficiency attributable to the understatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Understatement. The term understatement has the meaning given to  such term by section 6662(d)(2)(A) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>. All of the facts  and circumstances are considered in determining whether a requesting  spouse had reason to know of an understatement. The facts and  circumstances that are considered include, but are not limited to, the  nature of the erroneous item and the amount of the erroneous item  relative to other items; the couple's financial situation; the  requesting spouse's educational background and business experience; the  extent of the requesting spouse's participation in the activity that  resulted in the erroneous item; whether the requesting spouse failed to  inquire, at or before the time the return was signed, about items on the  return or omitted from the return that a reasonable person would  question; and whether the erroneous item represented a departure from a  recurring pattern reflected in prior years' returns (e.g., omitted  income from an investment regularly reported on prior years' returns).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of  this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Partial relief--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a requesting spouse had no  knowledge or reason to know of only a portion of an erroneous item, the  requesting spouse may be relieved of the liability attributable to that  portion of that item, if all other requirements are met with respect to  that portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth3">Example. H and W are married and file their 2004 joint income tax  return in March 2005. In April 2006, H is convicted of embezzling $2  million from his employer during 2004. H kept all of his embezzlement  income in an individual bank account, and he used most of the funds to  support his gambling habit. H and W had a joint bank account into which  H and W deposited all of their reported income. Each month during 2004,  H transferred an additional $10,000 from the individual account to H and  W's joint bank account. W paid the household expenses using this joint  account, and regularly received the bank statements relating to the  account. W had no knowledge or reason to know of H's embezzling  activities. However, W did have knowledge and reason to know of $120,000  of the $2 million of H's embezzlement income at the time she signed the  joint return because that amount passed through the couple's joint bank  account. Therefore, W may be relieved of the liability arising from  $1,880,000 of the unreported embezzlement income, but she may not be  relieved of the liability for the deficiency arising from $120,000 of  the unreported embezzlement income of which she knew and had reason to  know.
