                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A special need request, as described in Sec. 301.1, may be  generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the  request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request  must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also  collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need  requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request  must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze  the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need  requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a  plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the  request and must contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing  that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of  concern does not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if  already present in the State or political subdivision, the distribution  of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of  concern;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest  is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or  other scientific data showing that the biological control organism,  noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political  subdivision and become established;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed  to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological  control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the  environment or agricultural resources in the State or political  subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including  quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would  result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control  organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political  subdivision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specific information showing that the State or political  subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to  the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as  unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other  special basis for the request for additional restrictions or  prohibitions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or  restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed  additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and  that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be  adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological  control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political  subdivision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy  Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L.  Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room  301-E, Washington, DC 20250.</p>
