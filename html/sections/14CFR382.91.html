                                Sec. 382.91  What assistance must carriers provide to passengers
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a carrier, you must provide or ensure the provision of  assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability,  or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a  passenger with a disability, in transportation between gates to make a  connection to another flight. If the arriving flight and the departing  connecting flight are operated by different carriers, the carrier that  operated the arriving flight (i.e., the one that operates the first of  the two flights that are connecting) is responsible for providing or  ensuring the provision of this assistance, even if the passenger holds a  separate ticket for the departing flight. It is permissible for the two  carriers to mutually agree that the carrier operating the departing  connecting flight (i.e., the second flight of the two) will provide this  assistance, but the carrier operating the arriving flight remains  responsible under this section for ensuring that the assistance is  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must also provide or ensure the provision of assistance  requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered  by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger  with a disability, in moving from the terminal entrance (or a vehicle  drop-off point adjacent to the entrance) through the airport to the gate  for a departing flight, or from the gate to the terminal entrance (or a  vehicle pick-up point adjacent to the entrance after an arriving  flight).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This requirement includes assistance in accessing key functional  areas of the terminal, such as ticket counters and baggage claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This requirement also includes a brief stop upon the passenger's  request at the entrance to a rest room (including an accessible rest  room when requested). As a carrier, you are required to make such a stop  only if the rest room is available on the route to the destination of  the enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance and you can make the  stop without unreasonable delay. To receive such assistance, the  passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability  needing the assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a carrier at a U.S. airport, you must, on request, in  cooperation with the airport operator, provide for escorting a passenger  with a service animal to an animal relief area provided under Sec.  382.51(a)(5) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As part of your obligation to provide or ensure the provision of  assistance to passengers with disabilities in moving through the  terminal (e.g., between the terminal entrance and the gate, between gate  and aircraft, from gate to a baggage claim area), you must assist  passengers who are unable to carry their luggage because of a disability  with transporting their gate-checked or carry-on luggage. You may  request the credible verbal assurance that a passenger cannot carry the  luggage in question. If a passenger is unable to provide credible  assurance, you may require the passenger to provide documentation as a  condition of providing this service.</p>
