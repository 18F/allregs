                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A bank proposes to extend two credits (Credits A and B) to its  customer. Although the two credits are proposed to be extended at the  same time, each would be evidenced by a separate agreement. Credit A  would be extended for the purpose of providing the customer with working  capital (nonpurpose credit), collateralized by margin stock. Credit B  would be extended for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock  (purpose credit), without collateral or on collateral other than stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part allows a bank to extend purpose and nonpurpose credits  simultaneously or successively to the same customer. This rule is  expressed in Sec. 221.3(d)(4) which provides in substance that for any  nonpurpose credit to the same customer, the lender shall in good faith  require as much collateral   not already identified to the customer's purpose credit as the lender  would require if it held neither the purpose loan nor the identified  collateral. This rule in Sec. 221.3(d)(4) also takes into account that  the lender would not necessarily be required to hold collateral for the  nonpurpose credit if, consistent with good faith banking practices, it  would normally make this kind of nonpurpose loan without collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and (f), as requiring that whenever a lender extends two  credits to the same customer, one a purpose credit and the other  nonpurpose, any margin stock collateral must first be identified with  and attributed to the purpose loan by taking into account the maximum  loan value of such collateral as prescribed in Sec. 221.7 (the  Supplement).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Board is further of the opinion that under the foregoing  circumstances Credit B would be indirectly secured by stock, despite the  fact that there would be separate loan agreements for both credits. This  conclusion flows from the circumstance that the lender would hold in its  possession stock collateral to which it would have access with respect  to Credit B, despite any ostensible allocation of such collateral to  Credit A.</p>
