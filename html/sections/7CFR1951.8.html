                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regular payments. Regular payments are all payments other than  extra payments and refunds. Usually, regular payments are derived from  farm income, as defined Sec. 1962.4 of subpart A of part 1962 of this  chapter. Regular payments also include payments derived from sources  such as Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service payments  (other than those referred to in paragraph (b) of this section), off- farm income, inheritances, life insurance, mineral royalties and income  from mineral leases (see Sec. 1965.17 (c) of subpart A of part 1965 of  this chapter), including income from leases or bonuses. Regular payments  in the case of a Section 502 RH loan to an applicant involved in a  mutual self-help project will include loan funds advanced for the  payment of any part of the first and second installments. All payments  to the lock box facility(s) by direct payment borrowers are considered  regular payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extra payments. Extra payments are payments derived from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sale of chattels other than chattels which will be sold to  produce farm income or real estate security, including rental or lease  of real estate security of a depreciating or depleting nature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refinancing of the real estate debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash proceeds of real property insurance as provided in subpart  A of part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Instruction 426.1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A sale of real estate not mortgaged to the Government, pursuant  to a condition of loan approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Agricultural Conservation Program payments as provided in  subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transactions of a similar nature which reduce the value of  security other than chattels which will be sold to produce farm income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refunds. Refunds are payments derived from the return of unused  loan or grant funds, except that the term ``refunds'' as used in Form  1940-17, ``Promissory Note,'' will be construed to mean the return of  funds advanced for capital goods, when a loan is made for operating  purposes.
