Application for a permit shall  be made, in writing, by the State licensing agency to the head of the  Interior bureau or office having control of the property in question. In  the regulations in this part the term ``head of the Interior bureau or  office'' includes the authorized representatives of that bureau or  office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The head of the Interior bureau or office may deny an  application if he determines that the issuance of a permit would unduly  inconvenience the bureau or office or adversely affect the interests of  the United States. Such determination shall be in writing and shall  state the reasons on which it is based. The fact that a permit will be  without charge for rent shall not constitute a basis for denying an  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In considering applications for permits, due regard shall be  given to the terms of any existing contractual arrangements.</p>
