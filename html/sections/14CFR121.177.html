To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any reported tailwind component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).
