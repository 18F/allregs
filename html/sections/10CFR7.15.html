The determination shall include a  statement of the reasons for the closing, citing the applicable  exemptions in the Government in the Sunshine Act (as implemented by 10  CFR 9.104).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except when the President or designee determines in writing that  no notice should be published for reasons of national security, the  Secretary of the Commission shall make a copy of the determination to  close all or part of an NRC advisory committee meeting available to the  public upon request. If such a determination has been issued, the  meeting notice published in the Federal Register should comply with the  provisions of Sec. 7.12 applicable to closed meetings.
