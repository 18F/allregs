                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accelerated weathering. The container without contents shall be exposed to ultra violet light and subjected to a spray of water for about 30 seconds every 20 minutes for 100 hours at 120 [deg]F. As an alternate to this test the container may be exposed to an ultra violet light for 100 hours at 130 [deg]F. without the water spray. There shall be no evidence of warping or deterioration as a result of this test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Salt spray. The container shall be exposed to a spray of 20% by weight of reagent grade sodium chloride at about 95 [deg]F. for 100 hours. There shall be no evidence of corrosion or disintegration of the material as a result of this test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temperature change. The container shall be exposed to a temperature of 150 [deg]F. for one hour and then to a temperature of 30 [deg]F. below zero for one hour. There shall be no warping or deterioration of the gasket material as a result of this test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Container watertightness. After the completion of all other container tests, a closed empty container, lined with colored blotting paper, with the cover in a horizontal position and uppermost shall be submerged under a head of one foot of water for a period of two hours. At the end of this period the container shall be removed, opened, and examined for the presence of moisture. No seepage shall be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Carton watertightness. Four cartons from each container tested shall be submerged under a head of one foot of water for a period of two hours. Upon opening the sealed wrappers there shall be no evidence of leakage of water.
