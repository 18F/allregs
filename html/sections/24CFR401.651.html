                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to appeal. An owner may submit a written appeal to HUD, within 10 days of receipt of written notice of the decision described in Sec. 401.650, contesting the decision and requesting a conference with HUD. At the conference, the owner may submit (in person, in writing, or through a representative) its reasons for appealing the decision. The HUD or PAE official who issued the decision under appeal may participate in the conference and submit (in person, in writing, or through a representative) the basis for the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written decision. Within 20 days after the conference, or 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials by or on behalf of the owner, HUD will review the evidence presented for the administrative appeal and, using the standard of whether the determination of the final decision was reasonable, will advise the owner in writing of the

decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the original decision. HUD will act, as necessary, to implement the decision, for example, by offering a revised Restructuring Commitment to the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Who is responsible for reviewing appeals? HUD will designate an official to review any appeal, conduct the conference, and issue the written decision. The official designated must be one who was neither directly involved in, nor reports to another directly involved in, making the decision being appealed.
