                            <p class="depth0">Give the ultimate purchaser of each new vehicle written instructions  for properly maintaining and using the vehicle, including the emission  control system. The maintenance instructions also apply to service  accumulation on any of your emission-data vehicles. See paragraph (i) of  this section for requirements related to tire replacement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Critical emission-related maintenance. Critical emission-related  maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of  critical emission-related components. This may also include additional  emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we  approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related  maintenance on these components if you demonstrate that the maintenance  is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use  vehicles. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to  occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You present data showing that, if a lack of maintenance  increases emissions, it also unacceptably degrades the vehicle's  performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of  vehicles in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended  intervals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in  your maintenance instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely  to be done at the recommended intervals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recommended additional maintenance. You may recommend any  additional amount of maintenance on the components listed in paragraph  (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that these maintenance  steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If  operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section,  but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you  to disqualify those vehicles from in-use testing or deny a warranty  claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation  on your emission-data vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, you may identify this as  recommended additional maintenance under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, you may schedule any amount of  emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered by  paragraph (a) of this section (that is, maintenance that is neither  explicitly identified as critical emission-related maintenance, nor that  we approve as critical emission-related maintenance). Noncritical  emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the  components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix I, that is not  covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners  manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related  warranty valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not  allow you to disqualify those vehicles from in-use testing or deny a  warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or maintenance steps during  service accumulation on your emission-data vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance that is not emission-related. For maintenance  unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of  inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or  maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data  vehicles, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary.  You may perform this non-emission-related maintenance on emission-data  vehicles at the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the  ultimate purchaser (but not the intervals recommended for severe  service).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> if you do one of two  things:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a component or service without charge under the purchase  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Get us to waive this prohibition in the public's interest by  convincing us the vehicle will work properly only with the identified  component or service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Owner's manual. Explain the owner's responsibility for proper  maintenance in the owner's manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tire maintenance and replacement. Include instructions that will  enable the owner to replace tires so that the vehicle conforms to the  original certified vehicle configuration.</p>
