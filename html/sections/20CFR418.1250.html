                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When you request that we use a more recent tax year to determine  your income-related monthly adjustment amount, we will ask for evidence  of the major life-changing event and how the event significantly reduced  your modified adjusted gross income as described in Secs. 418.1255 and  418.1265. Unless we have information in our records that raises a doubt  about the evidence, additional evidence documenting the major life- changing event(s) will not be needed.</p>
