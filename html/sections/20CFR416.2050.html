The amount of the aid or assistance in the form  of money payments (as defined in 45 CFR 234.11(a)) which an individual  would have received (including any part of such amount which is  attributable to meeting special needs or special circumstances) under a  State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act in  accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan relating to  eligibility for and amount of such aid or assistance payable thereunder  which were in effect for the month of June 1973 together with the bonus  value of food stamps for January 1972 if for such month such individual  resides in a State which SSA has determined provides supplementary  payments the level of which has been found by SSA pursuant to section 8  of Pub.

The amount of the income of such individual other than  aid or assistance, received by such individual in December 1973,  remaining after application of all appropriate income exclusions and  used in computation of the amount of aid or assistance, minus any such  income which did not result, but which if properly reported, would have  resulted in a reduction in the amount of such aid or assistance. Income,  which because a State paid less than 100% of its standard of need, did  not cause a reduction in the amount of aid or assistance is included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special needs or circumstances. Special needs or circumstances  include needs of essential persons (as defined in Sec. 416.222), special  allowances for housing, and such other situations for which money  payments to or for an eligible individual were made under a State plan  approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act as in effect for June  1973.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optional supplement payable.
