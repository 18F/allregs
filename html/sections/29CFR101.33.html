                            <p class="depth0">If, after investigation, it appears that the Board should determine the dispute under section 10(k) of the Act, the Regional Director issues a notice of hearing which includes a simple statement of issues involved in the jurisdictional dispute and which is served on all parties to the dispute out of which the unfair labor practice is alleged to have arisen. The hearing is scheduled for not less than 10 days after service of the notice of the filing of the charge, except that in cases involving the national defense, agreement will be sought for scheduling of hearing on less notice. If the parties present to the Regional Director satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted the dispute, the Regional Director withdraws the notice of hearing and either permits the withdrawal of the charge or dismisses the charge. If the parties submit to the Regional Director satisfactory evidence that they have agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment of the dispute, the Regional Director shall defer action upon the charge and shall withdraw the notice of hearing if issued. The parties may agree on an arbitrator, a proceeding under section 9(c) of the Act, or any other satisfactory method to resolve the dispute. If the agreed-upon method for voluntary adjustment results in a determination that employees represented by a charged union are entitled to perform the work in dispute, the Regional Director dismisses the charge against that union irrespective of whether the employer complies with that determination.</p>
