                                Sec. 884.106  Housing assistance payments to owners.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of the contract administrator. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the utility reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company. No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an Owner; however, cooperatives are considered rental housing, rather than Owner-occupied housing, for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vacancies during rent-up. If a Contract Unit is not leased as of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner shall be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract, in accordance with the procedure set forth in Sec. 884.213(b): Provided, That the Owner: (1) Commenced marketing and otherwise complied with Sec. 884.211(e), (2) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy, including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD or the PHA, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vacancies after rent-up. (1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days; provided, however, That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period in an amount

which, when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also Sec. 884.115). The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (c)(1) unless he: (i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (ii) has taken and continues to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days; provided, however, That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period in an amount

which, when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also Sec. 884.115). The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (c)(1) unless he: (i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (ii) has taken and continues to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, he shall not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that: (i) He gave such Family a written notice of the proposed eviction, stating the grounds and advising the Family that it had 10 days within which to present its objections to the Owner in writing or in person and (ii) the proposed eviction was not in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Debt-service vacancy payments. (1) If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner may submit a claim to receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to the vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether the vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner may submit a claim to receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to the vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether the vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional payments under this paragraph (d) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unit was in decent, safe and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) and (c)(2) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner has demonstrated, in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance wih the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the owner and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of the amount needed to make up the deficiency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The owner has submitted to HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that, based on the owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies. The Owner shall not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section to the extent he is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act or payments under Sec. 884.115).
