In addition, it may require from any covered airline further information about collection, storage and transmission procedures at any time. If the Department finds a covered airline's system to be deficient, it will require appropriate modifications, which must be implemented within the period specified by the Department. In addition, a covered airline not in compliance with this part may be subject to enforcement action by the Department.</p>
