In the event the person  does not consolidate such OCS-related permit activities with the State  agency's review of the OCS plan, such activities will remain subject to  individual State agency review under the requirements of subpart D of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A State agency objection to one or more of the OCS-related  federal license or permit activities submitted for consolidated review  shall not prevent the person from receiving Federal agency approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For those OCS-related license or permit activities found by the  State agency to be consistent with the management program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the license or permit activities described in detail in the  OCS plan provided the State agency concurs with the consistency  certification for such plan. Similarly, a State agency objection to the  consistency certification for an OCS plan shall not prevent the person  from receiving Federal agency approval for those OCS-related license or  permit activities determined by the State agency to be consistent with  the management program.</p>
