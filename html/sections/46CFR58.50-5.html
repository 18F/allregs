Avoid dissimilar metal contact with tank body.\6\ And other alloys acceptable to the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Joints. All metallic tank joints shall be welded or brazed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fittings. Nozzles, flanges, or other fittings for pipe connections shall be welded or brazed to the tank. The tank openings in way of pipe connections shall be properly reinforced where necessary. Where fuel level gages are used, the flange to which gage fittings are attached shall be welded or brazed to the tank. No tubular gage glasses or trycocks shall be fitted to the tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Baffle plates. All tanks exceeding 30 inches in any horizontal dimension shall be fitted with vertical baffle plates where necessary for strength or for control of excessive surge. In general, baffle plates installed at intervals not exceeding 30 inches will be considered as meeting this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Baffle plate details. Baffle plates, where required, shall be of the same material and not less than the minimum thickness required in the tank walls and shall be connected to the tank walls by welding or brazing. Limber holes at the bottom and air holes at the top of all baffles shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installation. (1) Gasoline fuel tanks used for propulsion shall be located in water-tight compartments separate from, but adjacent to the engineroom or machinery space. Fuel tanks for auxiliaries shall be located on or above the weather deck outside of the engine housing or compartment and as close to the engine as practicable. All tanks shall be so installed as to provide a free circulation of air around the tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline fuel tanks used for propulsion shall be located in water-tight compartments separate from, but adjacent to the engineroom or machinery space.

(1) Prior to installation, tanks vented to atmosphere shall be tested to, and must withstand, a pressure of 5 pounds per square inch or 1\1/2\ times the maximum head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater. A standpipe of 11\1/2\ feet in height attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 5 pounds per square inch test. Permanent deformation of the tank will not be cause for rejection unless accompanied by leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to installation, tanks vented to atmosphere shall be tested to, and must withstand, a pressure of 5 pounds per square inch or 1\1/2\ times the maximum head to which they may be subjected in service, whichever is greater.
