                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., the OMB has approved the  information collection requirements of part 887 and assigned it control  number 1029-0107. This information is being collected to support State  and Indian tribal grant requests for moneys for the establishment,  administration, and operation of self-sustaining State or Indian tribal  administered subsidence insurance programs. States and Indian tribes are  required to respond to obtain a benefit in accordance with SMCRA. A  Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to  respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently  valid OMB control number.
