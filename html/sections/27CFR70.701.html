                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formulation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alcohol, tobacco, and firearms rules take  various forms. The most important rules are issued as Treasury  decisions, prescribed by the Administrator, and approved by the  Secretary. Other rules may be issued over the signature of the  Administrator or the signature of any appropriate TTB officer. The  channeling of rules varies with the circumstances. Treasury decisions  are prepared within the appropriate TTB offices. After approval by the  Administrator, Treasury decisions are forwarded to the Secretary for  further consideration and final approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where required by 5 U.S.C. 553, the Administrator publishes in  the Federal Register general notice of proposed rules unless all persons  subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have  actual notice thereof in accordance with law. Notice may also be  published in the Federal Register in such other instances as may be  desirable. This notice includes (i) a statement of the time, place, and  nature of public rulemaking proceedings; (ii) reference to the authority  under which the rule is proposed; and (iii) either the terms or  substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and  issues involved. Interested persons may participate in the rulemaking by  submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons may also submit  requests for a   public hearing. However, the Bureau reserves the right to determine, in  the light of all circumstances, whether a public hearing should be held.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Bureau determines that the public good will be served  thereby, it may hold a public hearing for discussion of the issues  raised by the proposed regulations. Such a hearing is announced by a  notice in the Federal Register, stating the time and place where the  hearing is to be held. The following rules govern the conduct of the  public hearing only if incorporated by reference in the notice  announcing the hearing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person wishing to make oral comments at a public hearing shall  submit, within the time prescribed in the notice of hearing, an outline  of the topics he wishes to discuss, and the time he wishes to devote to  each topic. Ordinarily, a period of 10 minutes is the time allotted to  each person for making his oral comments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person making oral comments should be prepared to answer  questions not only on the topics listed in his outline but also on  matters relating to any written comments which he has submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the conclusion of the presentation of comments of persons  listed in the agenda, to the extent time permits, other comments will be  received.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Written comments submitted prior to the hearing shall be  available at the hearing for inspection. Any request for copies of such  written comments is treated as a request for records under 27 CFR  70.802(g).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> To the extent resources permit, the public hearings to which  this paragraph applies may be transcribed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In unusual circumstances or for good cause shown, the  application of rules contained in this paragraph may be waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comments on proposed rules. Interested persons may submit data,  views, or arguments with respect to a notice of proposed rulemaking  published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553. Procedures are provided in Sec.  70.802(g) for members of the public to inspect and obtain copies of  written comments submitted in response to proposed rules. All such  comments are open in their entirety to public inspection. Therefore, the  Bureau does not recognize any designation of material in comments as  confidential or not to be disclosed, and any material that the commenter  considers to be confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the  public should not be included in his comments. The name of any person  submitting comments or requesting a public hearing, the issues which may  be discussed at the hearing, and outlines relating to the hearing are  open to public disclosure. (See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for  rules relating to hearing outlines.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Petition to change rules. Interested persons may petition for  the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. A petition for the  issuance of a rule shall identify the section or sections of law  involved; and a petition for the amendment or repeal of a rule shall set  forth the section or sections of the regulations involved. The petition  shall set forth the reasons for the requested action. Such petitions  shall be given careful consideration, and the petitioner shall be  advised of the action taken thereon. Petitions must be addressed to the  Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Washington, DC 20220. A  petition to establish a new American viticultural area or to modify an  existing American viticultural area is subject to the rules in part 9 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Publication of rules and regulations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. All Alcohol  and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations and amendments thereto are  published as Treasury Decisions which appear in the Federal Register,  the Code of Federal Regulations, and the quarterly Alcohol and Tobacco  Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) Bulletin. The TTB Bulletin is the  authoritative instrument of the Bureau for announcing Treasury  decisions, legislation, administrative matters, and other items of  general interest. The Bulletin incorporates, into one publication, all  matters of the Bureau which are of public record. It is the policy of  the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary  to promote a uniform application of all laws administered by the Bureau  as well as rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those  previously published in the Bulletin (including those published   prior to July 1, 1972, in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). Procedures  relating solely to matters of internal management are not published;  however, regulations appearing in internal management documents and  statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights  and duties of the public are published. Rulings and procedures reported  in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Department of the  Treasury Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. In applying  published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation,  regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be  considered. Concerned parties are cautioned against reaching the same  conclusion in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are  substantially the same. The Bulletin is published quarterly and may be  obtained, on a subscription basis, from the Superintendent of Documents,  U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objectives and standards for publication of TTB Rulings and TTB  Procedures in the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bulletin. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A ``TTB  Ruling'' is an official interpretation by the Bureau that has been  published in the Bulletin for the information and guidance of taxpayers,  Bureau officers, and others concerned. TTB Rulings represent the  conclusions of the Bureau on the application of the law to the entire  state of facts involved. In those that are based on positions taken in  rulings to industry members or technical advice to Bureau field offices,  identifying details and confidential information are deleted to prevent  unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory  requirements concerning disclosure of information obtained from the  public.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A ``TTB Procedure'' is a statement of procedure that affects the  rights or duties of taxpayers or other members of the public under law  and regulations administered by the Bureau or information that, although  not necessarily affecting the rights and duties of the public, should be  a matter of public knowledge. TTB Procedures establish methods for  performing operations in compliance with the requirements of law and  regulations. It is Bureau practice to publish as much of the internal  management document or communication as is necessary for an  understanding of the procedure. TTB Procedures may also be based on  internal management documents which should be a matter of public  knowledge even though not necessarily affecting the rights or duties of  the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is the policy of the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all  rulings and other communications to members of the public or to Bureau  field offices involving substantive law, procedures affecting taxpayer's  rights or duties, or industry regulations, except those involving:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Issues specifically and clearly covered by statute or  regulations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Issues specifically covered by rulings, procedures, opinions, or  court decisions previously published in the Bulletin;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Issues not likely to arise again because of unique or specific  facts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Determinations of fact rather than interpretations of law;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Acceptability under the law and regulations of containers,  labels, and advertising involving alcoholic beverages;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Tobacco operations, such as the disposition of abandoned,  seized, or condemned tobacco products;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Informers and informers' rewards; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Disclosure of secret formulas, processes, business practices,  and other similar information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It is the practice of the Bureau to publish as much of the  ruling or communication as is necessary for an understanding of the  position stated. However, in order to prevent unwarranted invasions of  personal privacy and to comply with statutory provisions, such as 18  U.S.C. 1905 and 26 U.S.C 6103 and 7213, dealing with disclosure of  information obtained from members of the public, identifying details,  including the names and addresses of persons involved, and information  of a confidential nature are deleted from the ruling.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> TTB Rulings published in the Bulletin do not have the force and  effect of Department of the Treasury Regulations (including amendatory  Treasury decisions) but are published   to provide precedents to be used in the disposition of other cases, and  may be cited and relied upon for that purpose. No unpublished ruling or  decision may be relied on, used, or cited by any officer or employee of  the Bureau as a precedent in the disposition of other cases.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Concerned persons generally may rely upon TTB Rulings published  in the Bulletin in determining the Bureau treatment of their own  transactions and need not request specific rulings applying the  principles of a published TTB Ruling to the facts of their particular  cases. However, since each TTB Ruling represents the conclusion of the  Bureau as to the application of the law to the entire state of facts  involved, taxpayers, Bureau personnel, and others concerned are  cautioned against reaching the same conclusion in other cases unless the  facts and circumstances are substantially the same. They should consider  the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions and  TTB Rulings.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Comments and suggestions from taxpayers or other concerned  persons on TTB Rulings being prepared for publication in the Bulletin  may be solicited, if justified by special circumstances. Conferences on  TTB Rulings being prepared for publication will not be granted except  where the Bureau determines that such action is justified by special  circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The appropriate TTB officer is responsible for administering  the program for the publication of TTB Rulings and TTB Procedures in the  Bulletin including the standards for style and format.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph  (d)(2)(ii) of this section, each appropriate TTB officer is responsible  for the preparation and appropriate referral for publication of TTB  Rulings reflecting interpretations of substantive law made by his office  and communicated in writing to members of the public or field offices.  In this connection, the Chief Counsel is responsible for the referral to  the appropriate TTB officer, for consideration for publication as TTB  rulings, of interpretations of substantive law made by his office.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph  (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the appropriate TTB officers and the Chief  Counsel are responsible for determining whether procedures established  by an office under their jurisdiction should be published as TTB  Procedures and for the initiation, content, and appropriate referral for  publication of such TTB Procedures.
