                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to terms used in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Appropriate valves. Those valves in a particular piping system, i.e., fill lines, equalizer or overflow lines, sales lines,

circulating lines, and drain lines that must be sealed during a given operation.</p><p class="depth0">Effectively sealed. The placement of a seal in such a manner that the position of the sealed valve may not be altered without the seal being destroyed.</p><p class="depth0">Production phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is delivered directly to or through production vessels to the storage facilities and includes all operations at the facility other than those defined as being in the sales phase.</p><p class="depth0">Sales phase. That period of time or mode of operation during which crude oil is removed from the storage facilities for sales, transportation or other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Seal. A device, uniquely numbered, which completely secures a valve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Minimum standards. Each lessee must comply with the following minimum standards to assist in providing accountability for oil or gas production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All lines entering or leaving oil storage tanks must have valves capable of being effectively sealed during the production and sales operations unless otherwise modified by other subparagraphs of this paragraph. Any equipment needed for effective sealing, excluding the seals, must be located at the site. For a minimum of 6 years the lessee must maintain a record of seal numbers used and must document on which valves or connections they were used as well as when they were installed and removed. The site facility diagram(s) must show which valves will be sealed in which position during both the production and sales phases of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each LACT system must employ meters that have non-resettable totalizers. There may not be any by-pass piping around the LACT. All components of the LACT that are used for volume or quality determinations of the oil must be effectively sealed. For systems where production may only be removed through the LACT, no sales or equalizer valves need be sealed. However, any valves which may allow access for removal of oil before measurement through the LACT must be effectively sealed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There must not be any by-pass piping around gas meters. Equipment which permits changing the orifice plate without bleeding the pressure off the gas meter run is not considered a by-pass.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For oil measured and sold by hand gauging, all appropriate valves must be sealed during the production or sales phase, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Circulating lines having valves which may allow access to remove oil from storage and sales facilities to any other source except through the treating equipment back to storage must be effectively sealed as near the storage tank as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The lessee, with reasonable frequency, must inspect all leases to determine production volumes and that the minimum site security standards are being met. The lessee must retain records of such inspections and measurements for 6 years from generation. Such records and measurements must be available to the Superintendent upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any lessee may request the Superintendent to approve a variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed by this section. The variance request must be submitted in writing to the Superintendent who may consider such factors as regional oil field facility characteristics and fenced, guarded sites. The Superintendent may approve a variance if the proposed alternative will ensure measures equal to or in excess of the minimum standards provided in paragraph (b) of this section will be put in place to detect or prevent internal and external theft, and will result in proper production accountability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Site security plans. (1) Site security plans, which include the lessee's plan for complying with the minimum standards enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section for ensuring accountability of oil/condensate production are required for all facilities and the lessee must maintain such facilities in compliance with the plan. For new facilities, notice must be given that it is subject to a specific existing plan, or a notice of a new plan must be submitted, no later than 60 days after completion of construction or first production, whichever is earlier, and on

that date the facilities must be in compliance with the plan. At the lessee's option, a single plan may include all of the lessee's leases, units, and communitized areas, provided the plan clearly identifies each lease, unit, or communitized area included within the scope of the plan and the extent to which the plan is applicable to each lease, unit, or communitized area so identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The lessee must retain the plan and notify the Superintendent of its completion and which leases, units, and communitized areas are involved. Such notification is due at the time the plan is completed as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Such notification must include the location and normal business hours of the office where the plan will be maintained. Upon request, plans must be made available to the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The plan must include the frequency and method of the lessee's inspection and production volume recordation. The Superintendent may, upon examination, require adjustment of the method or frequency of inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Site facility diagrams. (1) Facility diagrams are required for all facilities which are used in storing oil/condensate. Facility diagrams must be filed within 60 calendar days after new measurement facilities are installed or existing facilities are modified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No format is prescribed for facility diagrams. They are to be prepared on 8\1/2\"  x  11" paper, if possible, and be legible and comprehensible to a person with ordinary working knowledge of oil field operations and equipment. The diagram need not be drawn to scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A site facility diagram must accurately reflect the actual conditions at the site and must, commencing with the header if applicable, clearly identify the vessels, piping, metering system, and pits, if any, which apply to the handling and disposal of oil, gas and water. The diagram must indicate which valves must be sealed and in what position during the production or sales phase. The diagram must clearly identify the lease on which the facility is located and the site security plan to which it is subject, along with the location of the plan.</p>
