                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General purpose and content--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. All State agencies are  required to sufficiently automate their food stamp program operations  and computerize their systems for obtaining, maintaining, utilizing and  transmitting information concerning the food stamp program. Sufficient  automation levels are those which result in effective programs or in  cost effective reductions in errors and improvements in management  efficiency, such as decreases in program administrative costs. Thus, for  those State agencies which operate exceptionally efficient and effective  programs, a lesser degree of automation may be considered sufficient  than in other State agencies. In order to determine a sufficient level  of automation in each State, each State agency shall develop an ADP/CIS  plan. FNS may withhold State agency funds under Sec. 276.4(a) for  failure to submit an ADP/CIS plan in accordance with the deadlines for  submission, for failure to make appropriate changes in their ADP/CIS  plan within 60 days of their receipt of FNS comments, or for failure to  implement the approved ADP/CIS plan in accordance with the dates  specified therein, unless extensions of time or deviations from the plan  or schedules have been approved by FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content. In developing their ADP/CIS plans, State agencies shall  use one of the following three formats:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State agencies which are sufficiently automated in each area  specified in Sec. 272.10(b) may provide a single certification statement  that they are sufficiently automated in each area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies which are sufficiently automated in some, but  not all,   areas specified in Sec. 272.10(b) shall submit an ADP/CIS plan which  consists of two parts. The first part would be the State agency's  certification as to the areas in which they are sufficiently automated.  The second part would describe the areas of Sec. 272.10(b) which the  State agency has not automated or, in its opinion, has not automated  sufficiently and include the State agency's plans for sufficiently  automating these areas. State agencies shall include a description of  how they intend to automate each area and a timetable for each planned  activity, including a consideration of transfers as discussed in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section. State agencies which are not planning  to automate each of the areas specified Sec. 272.10(b) or which are not  already automated in these areas shall provide justification. Any such  justification shall include a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State agencies which are not sufficiently automated in any of  the areas specified in Sec. 272.10(b) shall submit an ADP/CIS plan which  describes their plans for sufficiently automating each area, including a  timetable for each planned activity, and including a consideration of  transfers as discussed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. State  agencies which are not planning to automate each of the areas specified  in Sec. 272.10(b) or which are not, in their opinion, sufficiently  automated in these areas shall provide justification. Any such  justification shall include a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transfers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State agencies planning additional automation  shall consult with other State agencies and with the appropriate  Regional Office to determine whether a transfer or modification of an  existing system from another jurisdiction would be more efficient and  cost effective than the development of a new system. In assessing the  practicability of a transfer, State agencies should consult with other  State agencies that have similar characteristics such as whether they  are urban or rural, whether they are county or State administered, the  geographic size of the States and the size of the caseload.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State agencies that plan to automate operations using any  method other than transfers will need to be able to justify why they are  not using transfers. The justification will need to include the results  of the consultations with other State agencies, the relative costs of  transfer and the system the State agency plans to develop, and the  reasons for not using a transfer. Common reasons for not using transfers  include: The State agency is required to use a central data processing  facility and the (otherwise) transferable system is incompatible with  it; the State agency's data base management software is incompatible  with the transferable system; the State agency's ADP experts are not  familiar with the software/hardware used by the transferable system and  acquiring new expertise would be expensive; the transferable system is  interactive or uses ``generic'' caseworkers, the receiving State agency  does not and it would be expensive to modify the existing system and/or  procedures; and transfer would provoke disputes with the State agency's  personnel union. State agencies that cite any of these reasons shall not  automatically receive approval to develop non-transferred systems. State  agencies shall show what efforts were considered to overcome the  problems and that those efforts are cost ineffective. This justification  will need to be included as part of the Advance Planning Document that  the State agency must submit for approval of its proposed system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> FNS will assist State agencies that request assistance in  determining what other States have systems that should be considered as  possible transfers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em>, General, of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine eligibility and calculate benefits  or validate the eligibility worker's calculations by processing and  storing all   casefile information necessary for the eligibility determination and  benefit computation (including but not limited to all household members'  names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, individual  household members' earned and unearned income by source, deductions,  resources and household size).
