                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with part 1953 of this chapter, the following Utah plan changes were approved by the Assistant Secretary:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Legislation. (1) The State submitted an amendment to the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act (chapter 46a, title 63, Utah Code Annotated 1953), which became effective on April 29, 1985, which provides for rulemaking procedures similar to those of Federal

OSHA in sections pertaining to expansion of definitions; availability of proposed rule to the public; a set time period allowed for public comment; the time period provided for a requested hearing to be held; and, provisions for determining the validity or applicability of a rule in an action for declaratory judgment. The Assistant Secretary approved the amendment on October 24, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State submitted amendments to its Occupational Safety and Health Act (chapter 69, Utah Code Annotated 1953), which became effective on April 29, 1985, which provide for seeking administrative warrants, clarify review procedures for the hearing examiner, provide for issuing a permanent standard no later than 120 days after publication of an emergency standard, and remove inconsistent requirements for adopting rules and regulations. The Assistant Secretary approved the amendments on October 24, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On March 29, 1994, the Assistant Secretary approved Utah's revised statutory penalty levels which are the same as the revised Federal penalty levels contained in section 17 of the Act as amended on November 5, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Voluntary Protection Program. On December 30, 1993, the Assistant Secretary approved Utah's plan supplement, which is generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Temporary labor camps/field sanitation. Effective February 3, 1997, the Assistant Secretary approved Utah's plan amendment, dated July 31, 1996, relinquishing coverage for the issues of field sanitation (29 CFR 1928.110) and temporary labor camps (29 CFR 1910.142) in agriculture (except for agricultural temporary labor camps associated with egg, poultry or red meat production, or the post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.) The Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, has assumed responsibility for enforcement of these Federal OSHA standards in agriculture in Utah pursuant to Secretary of Labor's Order 5-96, dated December 27, 1996.
[53 FR 43689, Oct. 28, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 2295, Jan. 14, 1994; 59 FR 14555, Mar. 29, 1994; 62 FR 2561, Jan. 17, 1997]</p>
