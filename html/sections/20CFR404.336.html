                            <p class="depth0">We will find you entitled to widow's or widower's benefits as the surviving divorced wife or the surviving divorced

husband of a person who died fully insured if you meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You are the insured's surviving divorced wife or surviving divorced husband and you meet both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You were validly married to the insured under State law as described in Sec. 404.345 or are deemed to have been validly married as described in Sec. 404.346.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You were married to the insured for at least 10 years immediately before your divorce became final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You apply, except that you need not apply again if you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are entitled to wife's or husband's benefits for the month before the month in which the insured dies and you have attained full retirement age (as defined in Sec. 404.409) or you are not entitled to old-age or disability benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are entitled to mother's or father's benefits for the month before the month in which you attain full retirement age (as defined in Sec. 404.409).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are entitled to wife's or husband's benefits and to either old-age or disability benefits in the month before the month of the insured's death, you have not attained full retirement age (as defined in Sec. 404.409) in the month of death, and you have filed a Certificate of Election in which you elect to receive reduced widow's or widower's benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You applied in 1990 for widow's or widower's benefits based on disability, and you meet the requirements in both paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You were entitled to disability insurance benefits for December 1990 or eligible for supplemental security income or federally administered State supplementary payments, as specified in subparts B and T of part 416 of this chapter, respectively, for January 1991.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You were found not disabled for any month based on the definition of disability in Secs. 404.1577 and 404.1578, as in effect prior to January 1991, but would have been entitled if the standard in Sec. 404.1505(a) had applied. (This exception to the requirement for filing an application is effective only with respect to benefits payable for months after December 1990.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You are at least 60 years old; or you are at least 50 years old and have a disability as defined in Sec. 404.1505 and you meet all of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your disability started not later than 7 years after the insured died or 7 years after you were last entitled to mother's or father's benefits or to widow's or widower's benefits based upon a disability, whichever occurred last.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your disability continued during a waiting period of 5 full consecutive months, unless months beginning with the first month of eligibility for supplemental security income or federally administered State supplementary payments are counted, as explained in the Exception in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This waiting period may begin no earlier than the 17th month before you applied; the fifth month before the insured died; or if you were previously entitled to mother's, father's, widow's, or widower's benefits, the 5th month before your previous entitlement to benefits ended. If you were previously entitled to widow's or widower's benefits based upon a disability, no waiting period is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception: For monthly benefits payable for months after December 1990, if you were or have been eligible for supplemental security income or federally administered State supplementary payments, as specified in subparts B and T of part 416 of this chapter, respectively, your disability does not have to have continued through a separate, full 5-month waiting period before you may begin receiving benefits. We will include as months of the 5-month waiting period the months in a period beginning with the first month you received supplemental security income or a federally administered State supplementary payment and continuing through all succeeding months, regardless of whether the months in the period coincide with the months in which your waiting period would have occurred, or whether you continued to be eligible for supplemental security income or a federally administered State supplementary payment after

the period began, or whether you met the nondisability requirements for entitlement to widow's or widower's benefits. However, we will not pay you benefits under this provision for any month prior to January 1991.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You have not previously received 36 months of payments based on disability when drug addiction or alcoholism was a contributing factor material to the determination of disability (as described in Sec. 404.1535), regardless of the number of entitlement periods you may have had, or your current application for widow's or widower's benefits is not based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You are not entitled to an old-age benefit that is equal to or larger than the insured person's primary insurance amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You are unmarried, unless for benefits for months after 1983 you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You remarried after you became 60 years old.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are now age 60 or older and you meet both of the conditions in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You remarried after attaining age 50 but before attaining age 60.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the remarriage, you were entitled to widow's or widower's benefits as a disabled widow or widower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are now at least age 50 but not yet age 60 and you meet both of the conditions in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You remarried after attaining age 50.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You met the disability requirements in paragraph (c) of this section at the time of your remarriage (i.e., your disability began within the specified time and before your remarriage).
