In addition, packages not loaded inside a cargo transport unit  and stowed on deck must be shaded from direct sunlight. The surface of a  cargo transport unit can heat rapidly when in direct sunlight in nearly  windless conditions and the cargo may also become heated. Depending on  the nature of the goods in the cargo transport unit, and the planned  voyage, precautions must be taken to ensure that exposure to direct  sunlight is reduced.</p><p class="depth2">Readily combustible material means a material which may or may not  be classed as a hazardous material but which is easily ignited and  supports combustion.
