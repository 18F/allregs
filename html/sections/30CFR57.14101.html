Front-end loaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall not be tested

when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The approach shall be of sufficient length to allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shall be maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enough to accommodate the size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level, packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisture may be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the braking surface.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, including auxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stop under normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakes are not to be actuated during the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriate for the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which is designed for the power train to be disengaged during braking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximum of 20 miles per hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipment operator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stopped position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Test results shall be evaluated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does not exceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be considered valid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateral motion during the braking portion of the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initial test run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additional test runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performance of the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment does not exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additional tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipment is not capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake system meets the performance requirements of this standard.
