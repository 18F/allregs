                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As part of agency management, supervisors and managers should be  included in the decision-making process and notified of executive-level  decisions on a timely basis. Each agency must establish and maintain a  system for intra-management communication and consultation with its  supervisors and managers. Agencies must also establish consultative  relationships with associations whose membership is primarily composed  of Federal supervisory and/or managerial personnel, provided that such  associations are not affiliated with any labor organization and that  they have sufficient agency membership to assure a worthwhile dialogue  with executive management. Consultative relationships with other non- labor organizations representing Federal employees are discretionary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consultations should have as their objectives the improvement of  managerial effectiveness and the working conditions of supervisors and  managers, as well as the identification and resolution of problems  affecting agency operations and employees, including supervisors and  managers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The system of communication and consultation should be designed  so that individual supervisors and managers are able to participate if  they are not affiliated with an association of management officials and/ or supervisors.   At the same time, the voluntary joining together of supervisory and  management personnel in groups of associations shall not be precluded or  discouraged.</p>
