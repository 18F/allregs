                            <p class="depth0">Nonjudgment debts may be compromised or adjusted upon application of  the debtor(s), or if the debtor is an individual and unable to act, upon  application of the guardian, executor, or administrator of the debtor's  estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. Debts, regardless of the amount, may be  compromised or adjusted subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debt or any extension thereof on which compromise or  adjustment is requested is due and payable under the terms of the note  or other instrument, or because of acceleration by written notice, prior  to the date of application for settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The period of time during which payments on adjustment offers  are to be made cannot exceed five years without the approval of the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Efforts will be made to avoid applications for settlement in  which debtors offer a specified amount payable upon notice of approval  of the proposed settlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debtor's ability to pay. In evaluating the debtor's settlement  application, it is essential that reliable information be obtained in  sufficient detail to assure that the offer accurately reflects the  debtor's ability to pay. The debtor's income, expenses, and nonsecurity  assets are critical factors in determining the type of settlement and  the amount which the debtor can reasonably be expected to offer.  Critical information should include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor's total present income from all sources will be  determined. In addition, careful consideration will be given to the  probable sources, amount, and stability of income to be received over a  reasonable period of years. For individuals, public welfare assistance  and pensions, including old age pensions and pensions received by  veterans for pensionable disabilities will not be considered as sources  of funds with which to make compromise and adjustment offers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The debtor's operation and maintenance expenses, and, in the  case of individuals, probable living expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The priority of payments on debts to third parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the debtor is largely dependent on income from an  occupation in which manual labor is required, age and health of the  individual are vital factors in determining the ability to pay. The  number in the debtor's family, their ages and condition of health, will  also be weighed in determining the ability to pay. However, when the  debtor's income is from investments, business enterprises, or management  efforts, age and health of both individual and family are of less  importance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The value of the debtor's assets in relation to debts and liens  of third parties is important in determining the debtor's ability to  pay. It is recognized that debtors must retain a reasonable equity in  essential nonsecurity property in order to continue normal operations  and, in the case of an individual, to meet family living expenses over a  period of years. Under this policy a reasonable equity in a modest  nonsecurity homestead occupied by the debtor, whether or not exempt from  levy and execution will not be considered as available for offer in  settlement. Nonsecurity property which is in excess of minimum business  and/or family living needs and which is not exempt from levy and  execution should be considered when determining the debtor's ability to  pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debtor unable to pay in full. Debts may be compromised or  adjusted and security property retained by the debtor, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor is unable to pay the indebtedness in full, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The debtor has offered an amount equal to the present fair  market value of all security or facility financed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The debtor has offered any additional amount which the debtor is  able to pay, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The total amount offered represents a reasonable determination  of the debtor's ability to pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Debtor able to pay in full but refuses to do so. If the debtor  has the ability to pay in full but refuses to do so, debts may be  compromised or adjusted and security property retained by the debtor  under certain conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OGC advises that the Government is unable to enforce  collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection  proceedings, and the amount offered represents a reasonable settlement  considering:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Availability of assets or income which may be realized by  enforced collection proceedings, considering the applicable exemptions  available to the debtor under State and Federal law, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inheritance prospects within 5 years, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Likelihood of debtor obtaining nonexempt property or income  within 5 years out of which there could be collected a substantially  larger sum than the amount of the present offer, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Uncertainty as to the price that the security or other property  will bring at forced sale, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OGC advises that there is a real doubt concerning the  Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount of  the debt, and the amount offered represents a reasonable settlement  considering:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The probability of prevailing on the legal issues involved, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The probability of proving facts to establish full or partial  recovery, with due regard to the availability of witnesses and other  pertinent factors, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The probable amount of court costs and attorney's fees which  may be assessed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in  litigation, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the cost of collecting the debt does not justify enforced  collection of the full amount. In such cases, the amount accepted in  compromise or adjustment may reflect an appropriate discount for  administrative and litigious costs of collection. Such discount will not  exceed $600 unless the OGC advises that in the particular case a larger  discount is appropriate. The cost of collecting may be a substantial  factor in settling small debts but normally will not carry great weight  in settling large debts.    Sec. Sec. 1956.125-1956.129  [Reserved]</p>
