(An FAA annual count is a fiscal year or a calendar year activity summary. Where actual traffic counts are unavailable or not recorded, adequately documented FAA estimates of the scheduled and nonscheduled activity may be used.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An airport meets the establishment criteria when it satisfies paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section and its benefit-cost ratio equals or exceeds one. As defined in Sec. 170.3 of this part, the benefit-cost ratio is the ratio of the present value of the ATCT life cycle benefits (BPV) to the present value of ATCT life cycle costs (CPV).
BPV/CPV=1.0</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The satisfaction of all the criteria listed in this section does not guarantee that the airport will receive an ATCT.</p>
