The objecting party must serve a copy of its objections on the other party. The recommended decision will become final 15 days after the Self-Governance Tribe receives the ALJs recommended decision, unless a written statement of objections is filed with the Secretary during the 15-day period. If no party files a written statement of objections within 15 days, the recommended decision will become final.</p>
