This would occur when a contract that is executed in an amount below that requiring a performance bond by 7 CFR part 1788, subpart C, is amended to an amount above that amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advance RUS approval to execute other contract amendments is not required. These amendments may be submitted to RUS at any time prior to closeout. If a borrower wishes to receive an advance of funds based on an amended contract amount (i.e., amendments that increase a contract by less than 20%), the borrower may initiate an increase in the amount approved for advance by submitting three copies of the amendment to RUS for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each amendment executed, the borrower shall make certain that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor's bond covers the additional work to be performed. If the amendment by itself (or together with preceding amendments) increases the original contract price by 20% or more, a bond extension will be required to bring the penal sum of the bond to the total amended contract price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an amendment covers construction in a county or state not included in the original contract, the borrower and contractor are licensed to do business in that location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon execution of any amendment that causes the amended contract amount to exceed the original contract amount by 20% or more, three copies of the amendment shall be submitted to RUS for approval.
