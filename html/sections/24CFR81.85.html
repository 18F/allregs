                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>  and the implementing regulations in this subpart G. The retention of  records of these orders, agreements, and statements, and their  modifications and terminations, are governed by 12 U.S.C. 4586(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions to disclosure. Exceptions to disclosure will be  determined in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4586 (c), (d), and (f) and  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing documents under seal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request by party. Upon the  denial by the ALJ of a motion for a protective order, any party may  request the Secretary to file any document or part of a document under  seal if the party believes that disclosure of the document would be  contrary to the public interest. Any other party may file with the  Secretary a reply to such a request within 5 working days after a  request is made or some other time to be determined by the Secretary.  Such requests and replies are governed by Sec. 26.38 of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of request. A document or part of a document that is the  subject of a timely request to the Secretary to file under seal will not  be disclosed under this section until the Secretary has advised the  parties and the ALJ, in writing, of the Secretary's decision on whether  the document or part of a document should be filed under seal. The ALJ  shall take all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such  documents or parts of documents, including closing portions of the  hearing to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time of request. Failure to file with the Secretary a timely  request or a reply is deemed a waiver of any objection regarding the  decision on whether a document is to be disclosed. A party must make its  request to file a document under seal at least 10 days before the  commencement of the hearing. A request may be filed at any other time  before or during the course of the hearing, but the requesting party's  obligation to produce the document or parts of the document will not be  affected by the party's pending request to the Secretary, unless the  Secretary expressly directs the ALJ to treat the document as protected  from disclosure until the Secretary makes a final written decision on  whether the document should be filed under seal. If the Secretary's  direction to the ALJ is made orally, that direction must be reduced to  writing and filed with the ALJ within 3 working days of the making of  the oral order or the document will then be subject to disclosure  pending the Secretary's final written decision on disclosure.
