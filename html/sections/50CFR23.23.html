                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article VI of the Treaty provides standard information that must be on a permit and certificate issued under Articles III, IV, and V. To identify a false or invalid document, any CITES document, including a CITES exemption document issued under Article VII, must contain standardized information to allow a Party to verify that the specimen being shipped is the one listed on the document and that the trade is consistent with the provisions of the Treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> CITES form. A CITES document issued by a Party must be issued in one or more of the three working languages of CITES (English, Spanish, or French). A CITES document from a non-Party may be in the form of a permit or certificate, letter, or any other form that clearly indicates the nature of the document and includes the information in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section and the additional information in Sec.  23.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required information. Except for a phytosanitary certificate used as a CITES certificate for artificially propagated plants in paragraph (f) of this section, or a customs declaration label used to identify specimens being moved between registered scientific institutions (Sec.  23.48(e)(5)), a CITES document issued by a Party or non-Party must contain the information set out in this paragraph (listed alphabetically). Specific types of CITES documents must also contain the additional information identified in paragraph (e) of this section. A CITES document is valid only when it contains the following information:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appendix                  The CITES Appendix in which the species,</p><p class="depth0">subspecies, or population is listed (see</p><p class="depth0">Sec.   23.21 when a Party has taken a</p><p class="depth0">reservation on a listing). For products</p><p class="depth0">that contain or consist of more than one</p><p class="depth0">CITES species, the Appendix in which each</p><p class="depth0">species is listed must be indicated on</p><p class="depth0">the CITES document.------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Applicant's signature     The applicant's signature if the CITES</p><p class="depth0">document includes a place for it.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) Bill of lading, air       As applicable for export or re-export: (i)</p><p class="depth0">waybill, or flight number     by ocean or air cargo, the bill of lading</p><p class="depth0">or air waybill number or (ii) in</p><p class="depth0">accompanying baggage, the flight number,</p><p class="depth0">as recorded on the CITES document by the</p><p class="depth0">inspecting official at the port, if known</p><p class="depth0">at the time of validation or</p><p class="depth0">certification.------------------------------------------------------------------------(4) Dates                     Date of issue and date of expiration</p><p class="depth0">(``valid until'' date on the standardized</p><p class="depth0">CITES form), which is midnight of the</p><p class="depth0">date on the CITES document.

The sex and age of a live specimen</p><p class="depth0">should be recorded, if possible. Such</p><p class="depth0">information must be in English, Spanish,</p><p class="depth0">or French on a CITES document from a</p><p class="depth0">Party. If a code is used to indicate the</p><p class="depth0">type of specimen, it must agree with the</p><p class="depth0">Guidelines for preparation and submission</p><p class="depth0">of CITES annual reports available from</p><p class="depth0">the CITES website or us (see Sec.</p><p class="depth0">23.7).------------------------------------------------------------------------(6) Document number           A unique control number. We use a unique</p><p class="depth0">12-character number.
