                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issuance of protective order. Upon motion by a party or by the  person from whom discovery is sought or by the administrative law judge  on his own initiative, and for good cause shown, the administrative law  judge may make any order that may appear necessary and appropriate for  the protection of the public interest or that justice requires to  protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or  undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That discovery not be had;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and  conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other  than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of  discovery be limited to certain matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons  designated by the administrative law judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order  of the Commission or the administrative law judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That a trade secret or other confidential research, development,  or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a  designated way; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or  information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the  Commission or the administrative law judge. If the motion for a  protective order is denied, in whole or in part, the Commission or the  administrative law judge may, on such terms and conditions as are just,  order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The  Commission also may, upon motion or sua sponte, issue protective orders  or may continue or amend a protective order issued by the administrative  law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unauthorized disclosure, loss, or theft of information. If  confidential business information submitted in accordance with the terms  of a protective order is disclosed to any person other than in a manner  authorized by the protective order, lost, or stolen, the party  responsible for the disclosure, or subject to the loss or theft, must  immediately bring all pertinent facts relating to such incident to the  attention of the submitter of the information and the administrative law  judge or the Commission, and, without prejudice to other rights and  remedies of the submitter of the information, make every effort to  prevent further mishandling of such information by the party or the  recipient of such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Violation of protective order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issue of whether  sanctions should be imposed may be raised on a motion by a party, the  administrative law judge's own motion, or the Commission's own  initiative in accordance with Sec. 210.25(a)(2). Parties, including the  party that identifies an alleged breach or makes a motion for sanctions,  and the Commission shall treat the identity of the alleged breacher as  confidential business information unless the Commission issues a public  sanction. The identity of the alleged breacher means the name of any  individual against whom allegations are   made. The Commission or administrative law judge shall allow the parties  to make written submissions and, if warranted, to present oral argument  bearing on the issues of violation of a protective order and sanctions  therefor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the breach occurs while the investigation is before an  administrative law judge, any determination on sanctions of the type  enumerated in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section shall be  in the form of a recommended determination. The Commission may then  consider both the recommended determination and any related orders in  making a determination on sanctions. When the motion is addressed to the  administrative law judge for sanctions of the type enumerated in  paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section, he shall grant or deny a motion by  issuing an order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any individual who has agreed to be bound by the terms of a  protective order issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and  who is determined to have violated the terms of the protective order,  may be subject to one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An official reprimand by the Commission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disqualification from or limitation of further participation in  a pending investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Temporary or permanent disqualification from practicing in any  capacity before the Commission pursuant to Sec. 201.15(a) of this  chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Referral of the facts underlying the violation to the  appropriate licensing authority in the jurisdiction in which the  individual is licensed to practice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Sanctions of the sort enumerated in Sec. 210.33(b), or such  other action as may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting requirement. Each person who is subject to a  protective order issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall  report in writing to the Commission immediately upon learning that  confidential business information disclosed to him or her pursuant to  the protective order is the subject of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subpoena;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A court or an administrative order (other than an order of a  court reviewing a Commission decision);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A discovery request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other written request, if the request or order seeks  disclosure, by him or any other person, of the subject confidential  business information to a person who is not, or may not be, permitted  access to that information pursuant to either a Commission protective  order or Sec. 210.5(b).</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (d): This reporting requirement applies only to  requests and orders for disclosure made for use of confidential business  information in non-Commission proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sanctions and other actions. After providing notice and an  opportunity to comment, the Commission may impose a sanction upon any  person who willfully fails to comply with paragraph (d) of this section,  or it may take other action.
