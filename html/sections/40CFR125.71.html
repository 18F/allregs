Such  a community may include historically non-native species introduced in  connection with a program of wildlife management and species whose  presence or abundance results from substantial, irreversible  environmental modifications. Normally, however, such a community will  not include species whose presence or abundance is attributable to the  introduction of pollutants that will be eliminated by compliance by all  sources with section 301(b)(2) of the Act; and may not include species  whose presence or abundance is attributable to alternative effluent  limitations imposed pursuant to section 316(a).</p>
