Any application which appears upon its face to be incomplete or to indicate that the applicant fails to meet the licensing requirements of the Act, or the Commission's regulations, shall be returned by certified U.S. mail or other method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice to the applicant without further processing, together with an explanation of the reason(s) for rejection, and the application fee shall be refunded in full.

A $250 fee for filing a new application and a $125 fee for filing an amended application will be assessed for filers using the automated FMC-18 filing system instead of the fees listed at Sec. 515.5(b)(1), (2).
