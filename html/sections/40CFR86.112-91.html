                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ambient conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temperature. The temperature of the  chamber in which the particulate filters are conditioned and weighed  shall be maintained to within [10 F (6 C) of a set point between 68 F  (20 C) and 86 F (30 C) during all filter conditioning and filter  weighing. A continuous recording of the temperature is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidity. The relative humidity of the chamber in which the  particulate filters are conditioned and weighed shall be maintained to  within [10 percent of a set point between 30 and 70 percent during all  filter conditioning and filter weighing. A continuous recording of the  temperature is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The environment shall be free from any ambient contaminants  (such as dust) that would settle on the particulate filters during their  stabilization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is required that two unused reference filters remain in the  weighing room at all times in covered (to reduce dust contamination) but  unsealed (to permit humidity exchange) petri dishes. These reference  filters shall be placed in the same general area as the sample filters.  These reference filters shall be weighed within 4 hours of, but  preferably just prior to, the pre- and post-test sample filter  weighings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the weight of either of the reference filters changes between  pre- and post-test sample filter weighings by more than [2.0 percent of  the test average primary filter loading (recommended minimum of 0.5  milligrams) or [0.010 milligrams, whichever is greater, then the post- test sample filter weights are invalid. However, the post-test weighing  procedure can be repeated to obtain valid weights within the time limits  as specified in Sec. 86.139.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The reference filters shall be changed at least once per month,  but never between pre- and post-test weighings of a given sample filter.  The reference filters shall be the same size and material as the sample  filters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Microgram balance specifications. The microgram balance used to  determine the weights of all filters shall have a precision (standard  deviation) and a readability of one microgram.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other procedures and equipment. Other procedures and equipment  may be used if shown to yield equivalent or superior results and if  approved in advance by the Administrator.  [56 FR 25773, June 5, 1991]</p>
