                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. (1) A State may request EPA to exclude data showing exceedances or violations of the national ambient air quality standard that are directly due to an exceptional event from use in determinations by demonstrating to EPA's satisfaction that such event caused a specific air

pollution concentration at a particular air quality monitoring location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration to justify data exclusion may include any reliable and accurate data, but must demonstrate a clear causal relationship between the measured exceedance or violation of such standard and the event in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determinations by EPA. (1) EPA shall exclude data from use in determinations of exceedances and NAAQS violations where a State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that an exceptional event caused a specific air pollution concentration in excess of one or more national ambient air quality standards at a particular air quality monitoring location and otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EPA shall exclude data from use in determinations of exceedances and NAAQS violations where a State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that emissions from fireworks displays caused a specific air pollution concentration in excess of one or more national ambient air quality standards at a particular air quality monitoring location and otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section. Such data will be treated in the same manner as exceptional events under this rule, provided a State demonstrates that such use of fireworks is significantly integral to traditional national, ethnic, or other cultural events including, but not limited to July Fourth celebrations which satisfy the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EPA shall exclude data from use in determinations of exceedances and NAAQS violations, where a State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that emissions from prescribed fires caused a specific air pollution concentration in excess of one or more national ambient air quality standards at a particular air quality monitoring location and otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section provided that such emissions are from prescribed fires that EPA determines meets the definition in Sec. 50.1(j), and provided that the State has certified to EPA that it has adopted and is implementing a Smoke Management Program or the State has ensured that the burner employed basic smoke management practices. If an exceptional event occurs using the basic smoke management practices approach, the State must undertake a review of its approach to ensure public health is being protected and must include consideration of development of a SMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Schedules and Procedures. (1) Public notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All States and, where applicable, their political subdivisions must notify the public promptly whenever an event occurs or is reasonably anticipated to occur which may result in the exceedance of an applicable air quality standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flagging of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A State shall notify EPA of its intent to exclude one or more measured exceedances of an applicable ambient air quality standard as being due to an exceptional event by placing a flag in the appropriate field for the data record of concern which has been submitted to the AQS database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flags placed on data in accordance with this section shall be deemed informational only, and the data shall not be excluded from determinations with respect to exceedances or violations of the national ambient air quality standards unless and until, following the State's submittal of its demonstration pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section and EPA review, EPA notifies the State of its concurrence by placing a concurrence flag in the appropriate field for the data record in the AQS database.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Flags placed on data as being due to an exceptional event together with an initial description of the event shall be submitted to EPA not later than July 1st of the calendar year following the year in which the flagged measurement occurred, except as allowed under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) or (c)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For PM2.5 data collected during calendar years 2004-2006, that the State identifies as resulting from an exceptional event, the State must notify EPA of the flag and submit an initial description of the event no later than

October 1, 2007. EPA may grant an extension, if a State requests an extension, and permit the State to submit the notification of the flag and initial description by no later than December 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For lead (Pb) data collected during calendar years 2006-2008, that the State identifies as resulting from an exceptional event, the State must notify EPA of the flag and submit an initial description of the event no later than July 1, 2009. For Pb data collected during calendar year 2009, that the State identifies as resulting from an exceptional event, the State must notify EPA of the flag and submit an initial description of the event no later than July 1, 2010. For Pb data collected during calendar year 2010, that the State identifies as resulting from an exceptional event, the State must notify EPA of the flag and submit an initial description of the event no later than May 1, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> When EPA sets a NAAQS for a new pollutant or revises the NAAQS for an existing pollutant, it may revise or set a new schedule for flagging exceptional event data, providing initial data descriptions and providing detailed data documentation in AQS for the initial designations of areas for those NAAQS. Table 1 provides the schedule for submission of flags with initial descriptions in AQS and detailed documentation. These schedules shall apply for those data which will or may influence the initial designation of areas for those NAAQS. EPA anticipates revising Table 1 as necessary to accommodate revised data submission schedules for new or revised NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Special Schedules for Exceptional Event Flagging and Documentation Submission for Data To Be Used in</p><p class="depth0">Initial Designations for New or Revised NAAQS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Air quality data         Event flagging &</p><p class="depth0">NAAQS pollutant/ standard/(level)/    collected for calendar    initial description     Detailed documentation</p><p class="depth0">promulgation date                      year                   deadline           submission deadline----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PM2.5/24-Hr Standard (35 [micro]g/     2004-2006..............
