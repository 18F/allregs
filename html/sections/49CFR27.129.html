                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decisions by Administrative Law Judge. After the hearing, the  Administrative Law Judge certifies the entire record including his  recommended findings and proposed decision to the Secretary for a final  decision. A copy of the certification is mailed to the applicant or  recipient and to the complainant, if any. The responsible Departmental  official and the applicant or recipient may submit written arguments to  the Secretary concerning the Administrative Law Judge's recommended  findings and proposed decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final decision by the Secretary. When the record is certified to  the Secretary by the Administrative Law Judge, the Secretary reviews the  record and accepts, rejects, or modifies the Administrative Law Judge's  recommended findings and proposed decision, stating the reasons  therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decisions if hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing pursuant to  Sec. 27.125(b) is waived, the Secretary makes his/her final decision on  the record, stating the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rulings required. Each decision of the Administrative Law Judge  or the Secretary contains a ruling on each finding or conclusion  presented and specifies any failures to comply with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension  or termination, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial  assistance, in whole or in part, to which this first regulation applies.  The decision may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as  are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this  part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial  assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended  unless and until the recipient corrects its noncompliance and satisfies  the Secretary that it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent proceedings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant or recipient adversely  affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this section is  restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if  it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order or if it brings  itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance  that it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order  entered pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section may, at any time,  request the responsible Departmental official to restore its  eligibility, to receive Federal financial assistance. Any request must  be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has  met the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the  responsible Departmental official determines that those requirements  have been satisfied, he/   she may restore such eligibility, subject to the approval of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the responsible Departmental official denies any such  request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request, in writing,  for a hearing specifying why it believes the responsible Departmental  official should restore it to full eligibility. It is thereupon given a  prompt hearing, with a decision on the record. The applicant or  recipient is restored to eligibility if it demonstrates to the  satisfaction of the Secretary at the hearing that it satisfied the  requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The hearing procedures of Sec. 27.127(b) through (c) and  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply to hearings held under  paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the  sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (e) of this  section shall remain in effect.
