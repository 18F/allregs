                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following are modified accredited advanced States: None.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following are modified accredited advanced zones: None.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any livestock other than captive cervids are included in a newly assembled herd on a premises where a tuberculous herd has been depopulated, the State or zone must apply the herd test requirements contained in the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' (January 22, 1999 edition), which is incorporated by reference at Sec. 77.1, for such newly assembled herds to those other livestock in the same manner as to captive cervids. Failure to do so will result in the removal of the State or zone from the list of modified accredited advanced States or zones and its being reclassified as modified accredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If tuberculosis is diagnosed within a modified accredited advanced State or zone in an animal not specifically regulated by this part and a risk assessment conducted by APHIS determines that the outbreak poses a tuberculosis risk to livestock within the State or zone, the State or zone must implement a tuberculosis management plan, approved jointly by the State animal health official and the Administrator, within 6 months of the diagnosis. The management plan must include provisions for immediate investigation of tuberculosis in animals held for exhibition and in livestock and wildlife; the prevention of the spread of the disease to other animals held for exhibition and to livestock and wildlife; increased surveillance for tuberculosis in animals held for exhibition and wildlife; eradication of tuberculosis from individual herds; a timeline for tuberculosis eradication; and performance standards by which to measure yearly progress toward eradication. If a State or zone does not implement such a plan within the required 6 months, the State or zone will be reclassified as modified accredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Modified accredited advanced State or zone status must be renewed annually. To qualify for renewal of a modified accredited advanced State or zone status, a State must submit an annual report to APHIS certifying that the State or zone complies with all the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' regarding modified accredited advanced States. The report must be submitted to APHIS each year between October 1 and November 30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To qualify for accredited-free status, a modified accredited advanced State or zone must demonstrate to the Administrator that it complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' has zero percent prevalence of affected captive cervid herds, and has had no findings of tuberculosis in any captive cervids in the State or zone for the previous 5 years. Except that: The requirement of freedom from tuberculosis is 2 years from the depopulation of the last affected herd in

States or zones that were previously accredited-free and in which all herds affected with tuberculosis were depopulated, 3 years in all other States or zones that have depopulated all affected herds, and 3 years in States or zones that have conducted surveillance that demonstrates that other livestock herds and wildlife are not at risk of being infected with tuberculosis, as determined by the Administrator based on a risk assessment conducted by APHIS.
