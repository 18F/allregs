                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The general definitions and abbreviations at 40 CFR part 401 shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulated parameters are listed with approved methods of analysis in Table 1B at 40 CFR 136.3, and are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> O&G; (as HEM) means total recoverable oil and grease measured as n-hexane extractable material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> TSS means total suspended solids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corrosion preventive coating means the application of removable oily or organic solutions to protect metal surfaces against corrosive environments. Corrosion preventive coatings include, but are not limited to: petrolatum compounds, oils, hard dry-film compounds, solvent-cutback petroleum-based compounds, emulsions, water-displacing polar compounds, and fingerprint removers and neutralizers. Corrosion preventive coating does not include electroplating, or chemical conversion coating operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Metal-bearing operations means one or more of the following: abrasive jet machining; acid pickling neutralization; acid treatment with chromium; acid treatment without chromium; alcohol cleaning; alkaline cleaning neutralization; alkaline treatment with cyanide; anodizing with chromium; anodizing without chromium; carbon black deposition; catalyst acid pre-dip; chemical conversion coating without chromium; chemical milling (or chemical machining); chromate conversion coating (or chromating); chromium drag-out destruction; cyanide drag-out destruction; cyaniding rinse; electrochemical machining; electroless catalyst solution; electroless plating; electrolytic cleaning; electroplating with chromium; electroplating with cyanide; electroplating without chromium or cyanide; electropolishing; galvanizing/hot dip coating; hot dip coating; kerfing; laminating; mechanical and vapor plating; metallic fiber cloth manufacturing; metal spraying (including water curtain); painting-immersion (including electrophoretic, ``E-coat''); photo imaging; photo image developing; photoresist application; photoresist strip; phosphor deposition; physical vapor deposition; plasma arc machining; plastic wire extrusion; salt bath descaling; shot tower--lead shot manufacturing; soldering; solder flux cleaning; solder fusing; solder masking; sputtering; stripping (paint); stripping (metallic coating); thermal infusion; ultrasonic machining; vacuum impregnation; vacuum plating; water shedder;

wet air pollution control; wire galvanizing flux; and numerous sub-operations within those listed in this paragraph. In addition, process wastewater also results from associated rinses that remove materials that the preceding processes deposit on the surface of the workpiece. These metal-bearing operations are defined in appendix C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-process wastewater means sanitary wastewater, non-contact cooling water, water from laundering, and non-contact storm water. Non-process wastewater for this part also includes wastewater discharges from non-industrial sources such as residential housing, schools, churches, recreational parks, shopping centers as well as wastewater discharges from gas stations, utility plants, and hospitals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Oily operations means one or more of the following: abrasive blasting; adhesive bonding; alkaline cleaning for oil removal; alkaline treatment without cyanide; aqueous degreasing; assembly/disassembly; burnishing; calibration; corrosion preventive coating (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); electrical discharge machining; floor cleaning (in process area); grinding; heat treating; impact deformation; iron phosphate conversion coating; machining; painting-spray or brush (including water curtains); polishing; pressure deformation; solvent degreasing; steam cleaning; testing (e.g., hydrostatic, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic flux); thermal cutting; tumbling/barrel finishing/mass finishing/vibratory finishing; washing (finished products); welding; wet air pollution control for organic constituents; and numerous sub-operations within those listed in this paragraph. In addition, process wastewater also results from associated rinses that remove materials that the preceding processes deposit on the surface of the workpiece. These oily operations are defined in appendix B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Process wastewater means wastewater as defined at 40 CFR parts 122 and 401, and includes wastewater from air pollution control devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Railroad line maintenance facilities means facilities specified at Sec. 438.1 that only perform routine cleaning and light maintenance on railroad engines, cars, car-wheel trucks, or similar parts or machines, and discharge wastewater exclusively from oily operations (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section and appendix B of this part). These facilities only perform one or more of the following operations: assembly/disassembly, floor cleaning, maintenance machining (wheel truing), touch-up painting, and washing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Railroad overhaul or heavy maintenance facilities means facilities engaged in the manufacture, overhaul, or heavy maintenance of railroad engines, cars, car-wheel trucks, or similar parts or machines. These facilities typically perform one or more of the operations in paragraph (h) of this section and one or more of the following operations: abrasive blasting, alkaline cleaning, aqueous degreasing, corrosion preventive coating, electrical discharge machining, grinding, heat treating, impact deformation, painting, plasma arc machining, polishing, pressure deformation, soldering/brazing, stripping (paint), testing, thermal cutting, and welding.</p>
