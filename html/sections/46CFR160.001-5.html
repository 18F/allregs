                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Production tests and inspections must be conducted in  accordance with this section, subpart 159.007 of this chapter, and if  conducted by an independent laboratory, the independent laboratory's  procedures for production inspections and tests as accepted by the  Commandant. The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and  inspections necessary to maintain quality control and to monitor  compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Oversight. In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159  of this chapter and the accepted laboratory procedures for production  inspections and tests, each manufacturer of a life preserver and each  laboratory inspector shall comply with the following, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturer. Each manufacturer must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Perform all tests and examinations necessary to show compliance  with this subpart and subpart under which the life preserver is approved  on each lot before any inspector's tests and inspection of the lot;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Follow established procedures for maintaining quality control  of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished  product; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allow an inspector to take samples of completed units or of  component materials for tests required by this subpart and for tests  relating to the safety of the design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Laboratory. An inspector from the accepted laboratory shall  oversee production in accordance with the laboratory's procedures for  production inspections and tests accepted by the Commandant. During  production oversight, the inspector shall not perform or supervise any  production test or inspection unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer has a valid approval certificate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production  methods and any revisions to those methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At least quarterly, the inspector shall check the manufacturer's  compliance with the company's quality control procedures, examine the  manufacturer's required records, and observe the manufacturer perform  each of the required production tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test facilities. The manufacturer shall provide a suitable place  and apparatus for conducting the tests and inspections necessary to  determine compliance of life preservers with this subpart. The  manufacturer shall provide means to secure any test that is not  continuously observed, such as the 48 hour buoyancy test. The  manufacturer must have the calibration of all test equipment checked in  accordance with the test equipment manufacturer's recommendation and  interval but not less than at least once every year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Lots. A lot may not consist of more than 1000 life preservers. A  lot number must be assigned to each group of life preservers produced.  Lots must be numbered serially. A new lot must be started whenever any  change in materials or a revision to a production method is made, and  whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs.  The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the  PFD manufacturer to determine the supplier's identifying information for  the component lot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> for  buoyancy testing. Additional samples must be selected for any tests,  examinations, and inspections required by the laboratory's production  inspections and tests procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Table 160.001-5(e)--Sampling for Buoyancy Tests ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Number of</p><p class="depth0">life</p><p class="depth0">Lot size                            preservers</p><p class="depth0">in sample ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 100 and under..............................................            1 101 to 200.................................................            2 201 to 300.................................................            3 301 to 500.................................................            4 501 to 750.................................................            6 751 to 1000................................................            8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a lot next succeeding one from which any sample life  preserver failed the buoyancy test, the sample shall consist of not less  than ten specimen life preservers to be tested for   buoyancy in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Buoyancy test. The buoyancy of the life preservers must be  determined by measuring the upward force exerted by the individual  submerged unit. The buoyancy measurement must be made at the end of the  24 or 48 hours of submersion, as specified in the applicable approval  subpart, during which period the pad inserts must not be disturbed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Buoyancy required. The buoyancy must meet the requirements of  the applicable approval subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Lot inspection. On each lot, the laboratory inspector shall  perform a final lot inspection to be satisfied that the life preservers  meet this subpart. Each lot must demonstrate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First quality workmanship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the general arrangement and attachment of all components,  such as body straps, closures, tie tapes, and drawstrings, are as  specified in the approved plans and specifications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with the marking requirements in the applicable  approval subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The information pamphlet specified in 33 CFR part 181 subpart G,  if required, is securely attached to the device, with the PFD selection  information visible and accessible prior to purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lot acceptance. When the independent laboratory has determined  that the life preservers in the lot are of a type officially approved in  the name of the company, and that such life preservers meet the  requirements of this subpart, they shall be plainly marked in waterproof  ink with the independent laboratory's name or identifying mark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Lot rejection. Each nonconforming unit must be rejected. If  three or more nonconforming units are rejected for the same kind of  defect, lot inspection must be discontinued and the lot rejected. The  inspector must discontinue lot inspection and reject the lot if  examination of individual units or the records for the lot shows  noncompliance with either this subchapter or the laboratory's or the  manufacturer's quality control procedures. A rejected unit or lot may be  resubmitted for testing and inspection if the manufacturer first removes  and destroys each defective unit or, if authorized by the laboratory,  reworks the unit or lot to correct the defect. A rejected lot or  rejected unit may not be sold or offered for sale under the  representation that it meets this subpart or that it is Coast Guard- approved.
