Once social security entitlement is certified to the Board, the Board then certifies the amount of the social security benefit to the Department of the Treasury for payment and makes any necessary adjustments in the individual's railroad retirement benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board has no authority with respect to the adjudication of the benefit to be paid under the Social Security Act.
