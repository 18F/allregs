                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of any request meeting the requirements of Sec. 108.3,  the Regional Administrator shall conduct a full investigation of the  matter, in order to determine whether the request may be related to an  effluent limitation or order under the Act. Following the investigation,  the Regional Administrator shall notify the employee requesting the  investigation (or the employee's representative) and the employer of  such employee, in writing, of his preliminary findings and conclusions.  The employee, the representative of such employee, or the employer may  within fifteen days following receipt of the preliminary findings and  conclusions of the Regional Administrator request a hearing under this  part. Upon receipt of such a request, the Regional Administrator, with  the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, shall publish  notice of a hearing to be held not less than 30 days following the date  of such publication where he determines that there are factual issues  concerning the existence of the alleged discrimination or its  relationship to an effluent limitation or order under the Act. The  notice shall specify a date before which any party (or representative of  such party) may submit a request to appear.</p>
