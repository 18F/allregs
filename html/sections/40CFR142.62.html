The State may require a public water system to use bottled water and point-of-use devices or other means, but not point-of-entry devices, as a condition for granting an exemption from corrosion control treatment requirements for lead and copper in Sec. Sec.  141.81 and 141.82 to avoid an unreasonable risk to health. The State may require a public water system to use point-of-entry devices as a condition for granting an exemption from the source water and lead service line replacement requirements for lead and copper under Sec. Sec.  141.83 or 141.84 to avoid an unreasonable risk to health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Public water systems that use bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or an exemption from the requirements of Sec.

The public water system must develop and put in place a monitoring program that provides reasonable assurances that the bottled water meets all MCLs. The public water system must monitor a representative sample of the bottled water for all contaminants regulated under Sec. Sec.  141.61 (a) and (c) and 141.62 during the first three-month period that it supplies the bottled water to the public, and annually thereafter. Results of the monitoring program shall be provided to the State annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The public water system must receive a certification from the bottled water company that the bottled water supplied has been taken from an ``approved source'' as defined in 21 CFR 129.3(a); the bottled water company has conducted monitoring in accordance with 21 CFR 129.80(g) (1) through (3); and the bottled water does not exceed any MCLs or quality limits as set out in 21 CFR 165.110, part 110, and part 129.

that the devices provide health protection equivalent to that provided by central water treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The public water system must apply effective technology under a State-approved plan. The microbiological safety of the water must be maintained at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The State must require adequate certification of performance, field testing, and, if not included in the certification process, a rigorous engineering design review of the point-of-use and/or point-of-entry devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The design and application of the point-of-use and/or point-of-entry devices must consider the potential for increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria in water treated with activated carbon. It may be necessary to use frequent backwashing, post-contactor disinfection, and Heterotrophic Plate Count monitoring to ensure that the microbiological safety of the water is not compromised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The State must be assured that buildings connected to the system have sufficient point-of-use or point-of-entry devices that are properly installed, maintained, and monitored such that all consumers will be protected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In requiring the use of a point-of-entry device as a condition for granting an exemption from the treatment requirements for lead and copper under Sec. Sec.  141.83 or 141.84, the State must be assured that use of the device will not cause increased corrosion of lead and copper bearing materials located between the device and the tap that could increase contaminant levels at the tap.
