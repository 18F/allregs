Any party may file and serve an answer, with  affidavits or other evidence in support of the answer, not later than 10  days after service of a written motion on that party. When a motion is  made during a hearing, the answer may be made at the hearing on the  record, orally or in writing, within a reasonable time determined by the  administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rulings on motions. The administrative law judge must rule on  all motions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Discovery motions. The administrative law judge must resolve all  pending discovery motions not later than 10 days before the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prehearing motions. The administrative law judge must resolve  all pending prehearing motions not later than 7 days before the hearing.  If the administrative law judge issues a ruling or order orally, the  administrative law judge must serve a written copy of the ruling or  order, within 3 days, on each party. In all other cases, the  administrative law judge must issue rulings and orders in writing and  must serve a copy of the ruling or order on each party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Motions made during the hearing. The administrative law judge  may issue rulings and orders on motions made during the hearing orally.  Oral rulings or orders on motions must be made on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Specific motions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complainant's motion to dismiss a request  for a hearing as prematurely filed. The complainant may file a motion to  dismiss a request for a hearing as prematurely filed instead of filing a  complaint. If the motion is not granted, the complainant must file the  complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later  than 10 days after service of the administrative law judge's ruling or  order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and  the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the respondent may  file an appeal in accordance with Sec. 406.175. If required by the  decision on appeal, the complainant must file a complaint and must serve  a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 10 days after  service of the decision on appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Respondent's motions instead of an answer. A respondent may file  one or more of the following motions instead of filing an answer. If the  administrative law judge denies the motion, the respondent must file an  answer not later than 10 days after service of the denial of the motion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Respondent's motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a  claim for which a civil penalty may be imposed. A respondent may file a  motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which a  civil penalty may be imposed instead of filing an answer. The motion  must show that the complaint fails to state a violation of the Act, a  regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license  issued or transferred under the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Respondent's motion to dismiss allegations or complaint for  staleness. Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, a respondent  may move to dismiss the complaint, or that part of the complaint that  alleges a violation that occurred more than 5 years before an   agency attorney issued a notice of proposed civil penalty to the  respondent, as provided by 28 U.S.C. 2462.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Respondent's motion for more definite statement. A respondent  may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the  allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. The  respondent must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain  allegations contained in a complaint or response to any pleading and  must submit the details that the party believes would make the  allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law  judge grants the motion, the complainant must supply a more definite  statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting  the motion. If the complainant fails to supply a more definite  statement, the administrative law judge must strike the allegations in  the complaint to which the motion is directed. If the administrative law  judge denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer and must  serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 10 days after  service of the order of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other motions to dismiss. A party may file a motion to dismiss,  specifying the grounds for dismissal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Complainant's motion for more definite statement. The  complainant may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an  answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. The  complainant must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain  allegations contained in the answer and must submit the details that the  complainant believes would make the allegation or response definite and  certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the  respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days  after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to  supply a more definite statement, the administrative law judge must  strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed.  An administrative law judge shall treat a respondent's failure to supply  a more definite statement as an admission of unanswered allegations in  the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other motions for more definite statement. A party may file a  motion for more definite statement of any pleading that requires or  permits a response under this subpart. A party must set forth, in  detail, each indefinite or uncertain allegation contained in a pleading  or response and must submit the details that would make each allegation  definite and certain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Motion to strike. Any party may make a motion to strike any  insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or  irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party must file a motion to strike  and must serve a copy on each party before a response to that pleading  is required under this subpart or, if a response is not required, not  later than 10 days after service of the pleading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Motion for decision. A party may make a motion for decision,  regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the  administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the  proceedings. The administrative law judge must grant a party's motion  for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,  admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially  noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no  genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is  entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion  for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of  material fact disputed by the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Motion for disqualification. A party may file a motion for  disqualification. A party may file the motion at any time after the  administrative law judge has been assigned to the proceedings but must  make the motion before the administrative law judge files an initial  decision in the proceedings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Motion and supporting affidavit. A party must state the grounds  for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias,  pecuniary interest, or other factors showing reason for  disqualification, in the motion for disqualification. A party must  submit an affidavit with the motion for disqualification that sets  forth, in detail, the matters alleged to constitute grounds for  disqualification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Answer. A party may respond to the motion for disqualification  not later than 5 days after service of the motion for disqualification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Decision on motion for disqualification. The administrative  law judge must issue a decision on the motion for disqualification not  later than 15 days after the motion has been filed. If the  administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and  supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the  administrative law judge must withdraw from the proceedings immediately.  If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not  warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state  the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law  judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 15  days after the motion has been filed, the motion is granted.  [Doc.
