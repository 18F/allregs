                                Sec. 1614.108  Investigation of complaints.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The investigation of complaints shall be conducted by the agency against which the complaint has been filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In accordance with instructions contained in Commission Management Directives, the agency shall develop an impartial and appropriate factual record upon which to make findings on the claims raised by the written complaint. An appropriate factual record is one that allows a reasonable fact finder to draw conclusions as to whether discrimination occurred. Agencies may use an exchange of letters or memoranda, interrogatories, investigations, fact-finding conferences or any other fact-finding methods that efficiently and thoroughly address the matters at issue. Agencies are encouraged to incorporate alternative dispute resolution techniques into their investigative efforts in order to promote early resolution of complaints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The procedures in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section apply to the investigation of complaints:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complainant, the agency, and any employee of a Federal agency shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence as the investigator deems necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Investigators are authorized to administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or affirmation or, alternatively, by written statement under penalty of perjury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the complainant, or the agency against which a complaint is filed, or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es), the investigator may note in the investigative record that the decisionmaker should, or the Commission on appeal may, in appropriate circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would

have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the opposing party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Issue a decision fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Take such other actions as it deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any investigation will be conducted by investigators with appropriate security clearances. The Commission will, upon request, supply the agency with the name of an investigator with appropriate security clearances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The agency shall complete its investigation within 180 days of the date of filing of an individual complaint or within the time period contained in an order from the Office of Federal Operations on an appeal from a dismissal pursuant to Sec. 1614.107. By written agreement within those time periods, the complainant and the respondent agency may voluntarily extend the time period for not more than an additional 90 days. The agency may unilaterally extend the time period or any period of extension for not more than 30 days where it must sanitize a complaint file that may contain information classified pursuant to Exec. Order No. 12356, or successor orders, as secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, provided the investigating agency notifies the parties of the extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within 180 days from the filing of the complaint, or where a complaint was amended, within the earlier of 180 days after the last amendment to the complaint or 360 days after the filing of the original complaint, within the time period contained in an order from the Office of Federal Operations on an appeal from a dismissal, or within any period of extension provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall provide the complainant with a copy of the investigative file, and shall notify the complainant that, within 30 days of receipt of the investigative file, the complainant has the right to request a hearing and decision from an administrative judge or may request an immediate final decision pursuant to Sec. 1614.110 from the agency with which the complaint was filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the agency does not send the notice required in paragraph (f) of this section within the applicable time limits, it shall, within those same time limits, issue a written notice to the complainant informing the complainant that it has been unable to complete its investigation within the time limits required by Sec. 1614.108(f) and estimating a date by which the investigation will be completed. Further, the notice must explain that if the complainant does not want to wait until the agency completes the investigation, he or she may request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, or file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court in accordance with Sec. 1614.407(b). Such notice shall contain information about the hearing procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where the complainant has received the notice required in paragraph (f) of this section or at any time after 180 days have elapsed from the filing of the complaint, the complainant may request a hearing by submitting a written request for a hearing directly to the EEOC office indicated in the agency's acknowledgment letter. The complainant shall send a copy of the request for a hearing to the agency EEO office. Within 15 days of receipt of the request for a hearing, the agency shall provide a copy of the complaint file to EEOC and, if not previously provided, to the complainant.
