                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(43)</em> of the Act. Any alien who does  not satisfactorily present proof of absence from the United States for  more than five consecutive years, or twenty consecutive years in the  case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, to the consular or  immigration officer, and any alien who is seeking to enter the United  States prior to the completion of the requisite five- or twenty-year  absence, must apply for permission to reapply for admission to the  United States as provided under this part. A temporary stay in the  United States under section 212(d)(3) of the Act does not interrupt the  five or twenty consecutive year absence requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, in accordance  with the form instructions, to the consular officer if that officer is  willing to accept the application, and recommends to the district  director that the alien be permitted to apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consular officer shall forward the application to the  district director with jurisdiction over the place where the deportation  or removal proceedings were held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special provisions for an applicant for nonimmigrant visa under  section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant for a nonimmigrant  visa under section 101(a)(15)(K) must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be the beneficiary of a valid visa petition approved by the  Service; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> File the application on the form designated by USCIS with the  fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), in accordance with the form  instructions with the consular officer for permission to reapply for  admission to the United States after deportation or removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consular officer must forward the application to the  designated USCIS office. If the alien is ineligible on grounds which,  upon the applicant's marriage to the United States citizen petitioner,  may be waived under section 212 (g), (h), or (i) of the Act, the  consular officer must also forward a recommendation as to whether the  waiver should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicant for immigrant visa. Except as provided in paragraph  (g)(2) of this section, an applicant for an immigrant visa who is not  physically present in the United States and who requires permission to  reapply must file the waiver request on the form designated by USCIS.  Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if the applicant  also requires a waiver under section 212(g), (h), or (i) of the Act, he  or she must file both waiver requests simultaneously on the forms  designated by USCIS with the fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1) and in  accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicant for adjustment of status. An applicant for adjustment  of status under section 245 of the Act and part 245 of this chapter must  request permission to reapply for entry in conjunction with his or her  application for adjustment of status. This request is made by filing the  application on the form designated by USCIS. If the application under  section 245 of the Act has been initiated, renewed, or is pending in a  proceeding before an immigration judge, the district director must refer  the application to the immigration judge for adjudication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicant for admission at port of entry. An alien may request  permission at a port of entry to reapply for admission to the United  States within 5 years of the deportation or removal, or 20 years in the  case of an alien deported, or removed 2 or more times, or at any time  after deportation or removal in the case of an alien convicted of an  aggravated felony. The alien must file the , where required, with the  DHS officer having jurisdiction over the port of entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other applicants. (1) Any applicant for permission to reapply  for admission under circumstances other than those described in  paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section must apply on the form  designated by USCIS with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and in  accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and requires consent to reapply  for admission after deportation, removal, or departure at Government  expense, or a waiver under section 212(g), 212(h), or 212(i) of the Act,  must file the requisite waiver form concurrently with the parole  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decision. An applicant who has submitted a request for consent  to reapply for admission after deportation or removal must be notified  of the decision. If the application is denied, the applicant must be  notified of the reasons for the denial and of his or her right to appeal  as provided in part 103 of this chapter. Except in the case of an  applicant seeking to be granted advance permission to reapply for  admission prior to his or her departure from the United States, the  denial of the application shall be without prejudice to the renewal of  the application in the course of proceedings before an immigration judge  under section 242 of the Act and this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Retroactive approval. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the alien filed the application  when seeking admission at a port of entry, the approval of the  application shall be retroactive to either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the alien embarked or reembarked at a place  outside the United States; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the alien attempted to be admitted from  foreign contiguous territory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the alien filed Form I-212 in conjunction with an application  for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, the approval of  the application shall be retroactive to the date on which the alien  embarked or reembarked at a place outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Advance approval. An alien whose departure will execute an order  of deportation shall receive a conditional approval depending upon his  or her satisfactory departure. However, the grant of permission to  reapply does not waive inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(A) of the  Act resulting from exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings which  are instituted subsequent to the date permission to reapply is granted.
