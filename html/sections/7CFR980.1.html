                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Findings and determinations with respect to imports of Irish  potatoes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing  Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), it is hereby found  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations have been issued  from time to time pursuant to the following marketing orders: No. 945  (part 945 of this   chapter), No. 948 (part 948 of this chapter), No. 947 (part 947 of this  chapter), No. 946 (part 946 of this chapter), and No. 953 (part 953 of  this chapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During the past several years, grade, size, quality, and  maturity regulations have been in effect pursuant to two or more of such  orders during each month of the year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The marketing of Irish potatoes can be reasonably  distinguished by the several seasonal categories, i.e., winter, early  spring, late spring, early summer, late summer, and fall. The bulk of  the fall crop is harvested and placed in storage in the fall and  marketed over a period of several months extending into the following  summer. But potatoes harvested from the other seasonal crops are  generally marketed as the potatoes are harvested. The marketing seasons  for these crops overlap.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Concurrent grade, size, quality, and maturity regulations under  two or more of the aforesaid marketing orders are expected in the  ensuing and future seasons, as in the past.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Therefore it is hereby determined that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Imports of red-skinned, round type potatoes during each month of  the marketing year are in most direct competition with potatoes of the  same type produced in the area covered by Marketing Order No. 946 (part  946 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Imports of all other round type potatoes during each month of  the marketing year are in most direct competition with potatoes of the  same type produced in Area 2, Colorado (San Luis Valley) covered by  Marketing Order No. 948, as amended (part 948 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Imports of long type potatoes during each month of the  marketing year are in most direct competition with potatoes of the same  type produced in the area covered by Order No. 945 (part 945 of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements. On and after  the effective date hereof importation of Irish potatoes, except  certified seed potatoes and red skinned, round types of potatoes, shall  be prohibited unless they comply with the following requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Through the entire year, the grade, size, quality, and maturity  requirements of Area II, Colorado (San Luis Valley) covered by Marketing  Order No. 948, as amended (part 948 of this chapter), applicable to  potatoes of the round type, other than red-skinned varieties, shall be  the respective grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for  imports of all other round type potatoes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Through the entire year the grade, size, quality, and maturity  requirements of Marketing Order 945, as amended (part 945 of this  chapter) applicable to potatoes of all long types shall be the  respective grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for imported  potatoes of all long types.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements as provided  for in this paragraph shall apply to imports of similar types of  potatoes, unless otherwise ordered, on and after the effective date of  the applicable domestic regulation or amendment thereto, as provided in  this paragraph or 3 days following publication of such regulation or  amendment in the Federal Register, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum quantities. Any importation which, in the aggregate,  does not exceed 500 pounds may be imported without regard to the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Plant quarantine. No provisions of this section shall supersede  the restrictions or prohibitions of potatoes under the Plant Quarantine  Act of 1912.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certified seed. Certified seed potatoes shall include only those  potatoes which are officially certified and tagged as seed potatoes by  the Plant Health and Production Division, Plant Products Directorate,  Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and which are subsequently used as  seed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Designation of governmental inspection services. The Federal or  Federal-State Inspection Service, Fruit and Vegetable Programs,  Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the  Food of Plant Origin Division, Plant Products Directorate, Canadian Food  Inspection Agency, are   hereby designated as governmental inspection services for the purpose of  certifying the grade, size, quality, and maturity of Irish potatoes that  are imported, or to be imported, into the United States under the  provisions of Sec. 608e of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Inspection and official inspection certificates. An official  inspection certificate certifying the potatoes meet the United States  import requirements for Irish potatoes under section 8e (7 U.S.C. 608e)  issued by a designated governmental inspection service applicable to a  particular shipment of potatoes is required on all imports of potatoes  other than certified seed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and certification by the Federal or Federal-State  Inspection Service will be available and performed in accordance with  the rules and regulations governing certification of fresh fruits,  vegetables, and other products (part 51 of this title), and each lot  shall be made available and accessible for inspection as provided  therein. Cost of inspection and certification shall be borne by the  applicant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Since inspectors may not be stationed in the immediate vicinity  of a port, or point of entry, an importer of uninspected and uncertified  Irish potatoes should make advance arrangements for inspection. Each  importer should give at least the specified advance notice to one of the  following applicable inspection offices prior to the time the Irish  potatoes will be imported.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Advance</p><p class="depth4">Ports and points             Inspection offices        notice</p><p class="depth4"><em>(days)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ All Maine ports and points of      In-Charge, Post Office              1</p><p class="depth4">entry.
