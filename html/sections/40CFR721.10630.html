Requirements as specified in Sec.  721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 770 parts per billion (ppb)  for the aggregate of the PMN substances, P-11-619 and P-11-620). When  calculating the surface water concentrations according to the  instructions in Sec. 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4), the statement  that the amount of the substances that will be released will be  calculated before the substances enter control technology does not  apply. Instead, if the waste stream containing the substances will be  treated before   release, then the amount of the substances reasonably likely to be  removed from the waste stream by such treatment may be subtracted in  calculating the number of kilograms released. No more than 90 percent  removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements.
