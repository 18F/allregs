                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If apparent noncompliance with these regulations in the  operation of an IRB is observed by an FDA investigator during an  inspection, the inspector will present an oral or written summary of  observations to an appropriate representative of the IRB. The Food and  Drug Administration may subsequently send a letter describing the  noncompliance to the IRB and to the parent institution. The agency will  require that the IRB or the parent institution respond to this letter  within a time period specified by FDA and describe the corrective  actions that will be taken by the IRB, the institution, or both to  achieve compliance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On the basis of the IRB's or the institution's response, FDA may  schedule a reinspection to confirm the adequacy of corrective actions.  In addition, until the IRB or the parent institution takes appropriate  corrective action, the agency may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withhold approval of new studies subject to the requirements of  this part that are conducted at the institution or reviewed by the IRB;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct that no new subjects be added to ongoing studies subject  to this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terminate ongoing studies subject to this part when doing so  would not endanger the subjects; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the apparent noncompliance creates a significant threat to  the rights and welfare of human subjects, notify relevant State and  Federal regulatory agencies and other parties with a direct interest in  the agency's action of the deficiencies in the operation of the IRB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The parent institution is presumed to be responsible for the  operation of an IRB, and the Food and Drug   Administration will ordinarily direct any administrative action under  this subpart against the institution. However, depending on the evidence  of responsibility for deficiencies, determined during the investigation,  the Food and Drug Administration may restrict its administrative actions  to the IRB or to a component of the parent institution determined to be  responsible for formal designation of the IRB.</p>
