If the educational institution does not require at least the same minimum number of hours of weekly attendance as are required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, VA will not apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, but will measure the course according to the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Shop practice and rest periods are</p><p class="depth2">excluded. Supervised instruction periods in school's shops in farm cooperative programs and the time involved in field trips and individual and group</p><p class="depth2">instruction may be included in computing the clock hour requirements.\7\ For full-time training the 440 clock hours a year may be prescheduled to provide not less than 80 clock hours in any 3-month period.
