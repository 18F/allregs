The pump shall be capable of operating within a range of from 1.5 to 2.5 liters per minute and shall be adjustable over this range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Flow rate consistency. The flow shall remain within 0.1 liters per minute over at least a 10-hour period when the pump is operated at 2 liters per minute with a standard sampling head assembly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Flow restriction indicator. The pump shall be capable of detecting restricted flow and providing a visual indication if it occurs. The flow restriction indicator shall remain activated until the cause is corrected. The pump shall shut down automatically if flow is restricted for one minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Duration of operation. The pump with a fully charged battery pack shall be capable of operating for (i) not less than 8 hours at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute against a resistance of 25 inches (64 centimeters) of water measured at the inlet of the pump; and (ii) for not less than 10 hours at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute against a resistance of 15 inches (38 centimeters) of water measured at the inlet of the pump.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Low battery indicator. The pump unit shall be equipped with a visual indicator of low battery power.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Elapsed time indicator. The pump unit shall be capable of displaying the actual pump run time in minutes (up to 999 minutes) and retaining the last reading after the pump is shut down due to either a flow restriction described in paragraph (a)(14) of this section or low battery power described in paragraph (a)(16) of this section or at the end of the sampling shift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sampling head assembly. The sampling head assembly shall consist of a cyclone and a filter assembly as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cyclone. The cyclone shall consist of a cyclone body with removable grit cap and a vortex finder and shall be constructed of nylon or a material equivalent in performance. The dimensions of the components, with the exception of the grit cap, shall be identical to those of a Dorr-Oliver 10 millimeter cyclone body, part No. 28541/4A or 01B11476-01 and vortex finder, part No. 28541/4B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Filter assembly. The filter assembly shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filter. The filter shall be a membrane filter type with a nominal pore size not over 5 micrometers. It shall be nonhydroscopic and shall not dissolve or decompose when immersed in ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. The strength and surface characteristics of the filter shall be such that dust deposited on its surface may be removed by ultrasonic methods without tearing the filter. The filter resistance shall not exceed 2 inches (0.5 centimeters) of water at an airflow rate of 2 liters per minute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capsule. The capsule enclosing the filter shall not permit sample air to leak around the filter and shall prevent visual inspection of the filter surface or filter loading. The capsule shall be made of nonhydroscopic material. Its weight, including the enclosed filter, shall not exceed 5 grams and it shall be pre-weighed by the manufacturer with a precision of 0.001 milligrams. Impact to the capsule shall not dislodge any dust from the capsule, which might then be lost to the weight measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cassette. The cassette shall enclose the capsule so as to prevent contamination and intentional or inadvertent alteration of dust deposited on the filter. The cassette must be easily removable without causing a loss or gain of capsule weight. The cassette shall be designed to prevent contaminants from entering or dust from leaving the capsule when it is not in use, and to prevent the reversal of airflow through the capsule or other means of removing dust collected on the filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arrangement of components. The connections between the cyclone vortex finder and the capsule and between the capsule and the \1/4\-inch (0.64 centimeters) (inside diameter) hose mentioned in paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall be mechanically firm and shall not leak at a rate of more than 0.1 liters per hour under a vacuum of 4 inches (10 centimeters) of water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Clamping of components.
