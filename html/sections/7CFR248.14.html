                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions for receipt of Federal funds--(1) Matching of funds--(i) Match amount. As a prerequisite to the receipt of Federal funds, a State agency must agree to contribute State, local or private funds, or program income, equal to not less than 30 percent of the total administrative FMNP cost. The Secretary may negotiate a lower percentage of matching funds, but not lower than 10 percent of the administrative cost of the program, in the case of an Indian State agency that demonstrates to the Secretary financial hardship for the affected Indian tribe, band, group, or council. The State agency may contribute more than the minimum amount. State, local or private funds for similar programs as defined in Sec. 248.2 may satisfy the State matching requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Matching of funds--(i) Match amount.

As a prerequisite to the receipt of Federal funds, a State agency must agree to contribute State, local or private funds, or program income, equal to not less than 30 percent of the total administrative FMNP cost. The Secretary may negotiate a lower percentage of matching funds, but not lower than 10 percent of the administrative cost of the program, in the case of an Indian State agency that demonstrates to the Secretary financial hardship for the affected Indian tribe, band, group, or council. The State agency may contribute more than the minimum amount. State, local or private funds for similar programs as defined in Sec. 248.2 may satisfy the State matching requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sources of matching contributions. A State agency may count any form of contribution authorized by 7 CFR 3016.24 toward the State matching requirement including in-kind contributions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to match. A State agency's failure to meet the State matching requirement will result in the establishment of a claim for the amount of Federal grant funds not matched. The matching requirement will be considered satisfied if State or other non-Federal matching contributions reported on the final closeout report (required by Sec. 248.15(a)) amount to at least 30 percent of the administrative costs. This match amount may be lower for those Indian State agencies that have demonstrated to the Secretary financial hardship as set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State Plan and agreement. A State agency shall have its State Plan approved and shall execute an agreement with the Department in accordance with Sec. 248.3(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distribution of FMNP funds to previously participating State agencies. Provided that sufficient FMNP funds are available, each State agency that participated in the FMNP in any prior fiscal year, shall receive not less than the amount of funds the State agency received in the most recent fiscal year in which it received funding, if it otherwise complies with the requirements established in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ratable reduction. If amounts appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under the FMNP are not sufficient to pay to each previously participating State agency at least an amount as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, each State agency's grant shall be ratably reduced, except that, to the extent permitted by available funds, each State agency shall receive at least $75,000 or the amount that the State agency received for the most recent prior fiscal year in which the State participated, if that amount is less than $75,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expansion of participating State agencies and establishment of new State agencies. Any FMNP funds remaining for allocation after meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be allocated in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of the remaining funds, 75 percent shall be made available to State agencies already participating in the FMNP that wish to serve additional recipients. If this amount is greater than that necessary to satisfy all State plans approved for additional recipients, the unallocated amount shall be applied toward satisfying any unmet need in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Of the remaining funds, 25 percent shall be made available to State agencies that have not participated in the FMNP in any prior fiscal year. If this amount is greater than that necessary to satisfy the approved State Plans for new States, the unallocated amount shall be applied toward satisfying any unmet need in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The Department reserves the right not to fund every State agency with an approved State Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any fiscal year, any FMNP funds that remain unallocated after satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, shall be reallocated in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expansion for current State agencies. In providing funds to State agencies that participated in the FMNP in the previous fiscal year, the Department shall consider on a case-by-case basis, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the State agency utilized at least 80 percent of its prior year food grant. States that did not spend at least 80 percent of their prior year food grant may still be eligible for expansion funding if, in the judgment of the Department, good cause existed which was beyond the management control of the State, such as severe weather conditions, or unanticipated decreases in participant caseload in the WIC Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation supporting the funds expansion request as outlined in Sec. 248.4(a)(19).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Funding of new State agencies. Funds will be awarded to new State agencies in accordance with Sec. 248.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Administrative funding. A State agency shall have available for administrative costs an amount not greater than 17 percent of total FMNP funds. The 17 percent administrative cost limitation shall not apply to any funds that a State agency may contribute in excess of its minimum matching requirement. A State agency may use any non-Federal contributions in excess of the 30 percent (or the negotiated percentage for those Indian State agencies that received a lower amount) matching requirement for food and/or administrative costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Market development. A State agency shall be permitted to use not more than 2 percent of total program funds for market development or technical assistance to farmers' markets if the Secretary determines that the State intends to promote the development of farmers' markets in socially or economically disadvantaged areas, or remote rural areas, where individuals eligible for participation in the program have limited access to locally grown fruits and vegetables.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Transfer of funds. A State agency may use not more than 5 percent of the Federal FMNP funds made available for the fiscal year to reimburse expenses incurred by the FMNP during a preceding fiscal year. The State agency shall provide such justification for its request to spend back funds under this paragraph as FNS may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Recovery of unused funds. State agencies shall return to FNS any unexpended funds made available for a fiscal year by February 1 of the following fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Reallocation of funds. Any funds recovered under paragraphs (d)(3) and (j) of this section will be reallocated in accordance with the appropriate method determined by FNS.
