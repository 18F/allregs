Three or more specimens representing the completed aircraft component are tested. Each test specimen is injected into an environmental chamber through which a constant flow of air passes. The specimen's exposure is determined by a radiant heat source adjusted to produce, on the specimen, the desired total heat flux of 3.5 W/cm\2\. The specimen is tested with the exposed surface vertical. Combustion is initiated by piloted ignition. The combustion products leaving the chamber are monitored in order to calculate the release rate of heat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Apparatus. The Ohio State University (OSU) rate of heat release apparatus, as described below, is used. This is a modified version of the rate of heat release apparatus standardized by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM E-906.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This apparatus is shown in Figures 1A and 1B of this part IV. All exterior surfaces of the apparatus, except the holding chamber, must be insulated with 1 inch (25 mm) thick, low density, high temperature, fiberglass board insulation. A gasketed door, through which the sample injection rod slides, must be used to form an airtight closure on the specimen hold chamber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Thermopile. The temperature difference between the air entering the environmental chamber and that leaving must be monitored by a thermopile having five hot, and five cold, 24-guage Chromel-Alumel junctions.

The thermocouples must have a .050 .010 inch (1.3 .3mm) diameter, ball-type, welded tip. One thermocouple must be located in the geometric center, with the other four located 1.18 inch (30 mm) from the center along the diagonal toward each of the corners (Figure 5 of this part IV). The cold junctions must be located in the pan below the lower air distribution plate (see paragraph (b)(4) of this part IV). Thermopile hot junctions must be cleared of soot deposits as needed to maintain the calibrated sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Radiation Source.

The fuel supplied to the burner must be methane mixed with air in a ratio of approximately 50/50 by volume. The total gas flow must be adjusted to produce flame lengths of 1 inch (25 mm). When the gas/air ratio and the flow rate are properly adjusted, approximately .25 inch (6 mm) of the flame length appears yellow in color.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calibration of Equipment--(1) Heat Release Rate. A calibration burner, as shown in Figure 4, must be placed over the end of the lower pilot flame tubing using a gas tight connection. The flow of gas to the pilot flame must be at least 99 percent methane and must be accurately metered. Prior to usage, the wet test meter must be properly leveled and filled with distilled water to the tip of the internal pointer while no gas is flowing. Ambient temperature and pressure of the water are based on the internal wet test meter temperature. A baseline flow rate of approximately 1 liter/min. must be set and increased to higher preset flows of 4, 6, 8, 6 and 4 liters/min. Immediately prior to recording methane flow rates, a flow rate of 8 liters/min. must be used for 2 minutes to precondition the chamber. This is not recorded as part of calibration. The rate must be determined by using a stopwatch to time a complete revolution of the wet test meter for both the baseline and higher flow, with the flow returned to baseline before changing to the next higher flow. The thermopile baseline voltage must be measured. The gas flow to the burner must be increased to the higher preset flow and allowed to burn for 2.0 minutes, and the thermopile voltage must be measured.

Cut a piece of core material such as foam or fiberglass, and cut a piece of film cover material (if used) large enough to cover the core material. Heat sealing is the preferred method of preparing fiberglass samples, since they can be made without compressing the fiberglass (``box sample''). Cover materials that are not heat sealable may be stapled, sewn, or taped as long as the cover material is over-cut enough to be drawn down the sides without compressing the core material. The fastening means should be as continuous as possible along the length of the seams.

Sec. Appendix I to Part 25--Installation of an Automatic Takeoff Thrust</p><p class="depth0">Control System (ATTCS)
I25.1 General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix specifies additional requirements for installation of an engine power control system that automatically resets thrust or power on operating engine(s) in the event of any one engine failure during takeoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With the ATTCS and associated systems functioning normally as designed, all applicable requirements of Part 25, except as provided in this appendix, must be met without requiring any action by the crew to increase thrust or power.
I25.2 Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS). An ATTCS is defined as the entire automatic system used on takeoff, including all devices, both mechanical and electrical, that sense engine failure, transmit signals, actuate fuel controls or power levers or increase engine power by other means on operating engines to achieve scheduled thrust or power increases, and furnish cockpit information on system operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Critical Time Interval. When conducting an ATTCS takeoff, the critical time interval is between V1 minus 1 second and a point on the minimum performance, all-engine flight path where, assuming a simultaneous occurrence of an engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting minimum flight path thereafter intersects the Part 25 required actual flight path at no less than 400 feet above the takeoff surface. This time interval is shown in the following illustration:

I25.3 Performance and System Reliability Requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The applicant must comply with the performance and ATTCS reliability requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An ATTCS failure or a combination of failures in the ATTCS during the critical time interval:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Shall not prevent the insertion of the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power, or must be shown to be an improbable event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Shall not result in a significant loss or reduction in thrust or power, or must be shown to be an extremely improbable event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The concurrent existence of an ATTCS failure and an engine failure during the critical time interval must be shown to be extremely improbable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All applicable performance requirements of Part 25 must be met with an engine failure occurring at the most critical point during takeoff with the ATTCS system functioning.
I25.4 Thrust Setting.</p><p class="depth0">The initial takeoff thrust or power setting on each engine at the beginning of the takeoff roll may not be less than any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Ninety (90) percent of the thrust or power set by the ATTCS (the maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing ambient conditions);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That required to permit normal operation of all safety-related systems and equipment dependent upon engine thrust or power lever position; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That shown to be free of hazardous engine response characteristics when thrust or power is advanced from the initial takeoff thrust or power to the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power.
I25.5 Powerplant Controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1141, no single failure or malfunction, or probable combination thereof, of the ATTCS, including associated systems, may cause the failure of any powerplant function necessary for safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The ATTCS must be designed to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Apply thrust or power on the operating engine(s), following any one engine failure during takeoff, to achieve the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power without exceeding engine operating limits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permit manual decrease or increase in thrust or power up to the maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane under existing conditions through the use of the power lever. For airplanes equipped with limiters that automatically prevent engine operating limits from being exceeded under existing ambient conditions, other means may be used to increase the thrust or power in the event of an ATTCS failure provided the means is located on or forward of the power levers; is easily identified and operated under all operating conditions by a single action of either pilot with the hand that is normally used to actuate the power levers; and meets the requirements of Sec. 25.777 (a), (b), and (c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide a means to verify to the flightcrew before takeoff that the ATTCS is in a condition to operate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide a means for the flightcrew to deactivate the automatic function. This means must be designed to prevent inadvertent deactivation.
I25.6 Powerplant Instruments.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of Sec. 25.1305:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A means must be provided to indicate when the ATTCS is in the armed or ready condition; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the inherent flight characteristics of the airplane do not provide adequate warning that an engine has failed, a warning system that is independent of the ATTCS must be provided to give the pilot a clear warning of any engine failure during takeoff.

These include parameters that affect all airplanes within the fleet, such as a statistical distribution of ambient temperature, fuel flash point, flight lengths, and airplane descent rate. Demonstration of compliance also requires application of factors specific to the airplane model being evaluated. Factors that need to be included are maximum range, cruise mach number, typical altitude where the airplane begins initial cruise phase of flight, fuel temperature during both ground and flight times, and the performance of a flammability reduction means (FRM) if installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The following definitions, input variables, and data tables must be used in the program to determine fleet average flammability exposure for a specific airplane model.</p><p class="depth0">N25.2 Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Bulk Average Fuel Temperature means the average fuel temperature within the fuel tank or different sections of the tank if the tank is subdivided by baffles or compartments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Flammability Exposure Evaluation Time (FEET).

With respect to a fluid or gas, flammable means susceptible to igniting readily or to exploding (14 CFR Part 1, Definitions). A non-flammable ullage is one where the fuel-air vapor is too lean or too rich to burn or is inert as defined below. For the purposes of this appendix, a fuel tank that is not inert is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within the tank is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used. For any fuel tank that is subdivided into sections by baffles or compartments, the tank is considered flammable when the bulk average fuel temperature within any section of the tank, that is not inert, is within the flammable range for the fuel type being used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Flash Point.

The temperature varies with altitude following the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) rate of change from the ground ambient temperature until the cruise temperature for the flight is reached. Above this altitude, the ambient temperature is fixed at the cruise ambient temperature. This results in a variation in the upper atmospheric temperature. For cold days, an inversion is applied up to 10,000 feet, and then the ISA rate of change is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fuel properties:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For Jet A fuel, the variation of flash point of the fuel is defined by a Gaussian curve, given by the 50 percent value and a 1-standard deviation, as shown in Table 1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The flammability envelope of the fuel that must be used for the flammability exposure analysis is a function of the flash point of the fuel selected by the Monte Carlo for a given flight.
