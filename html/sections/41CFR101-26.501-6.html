                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> GSA Form 1398, GSA Purchased Vehicle. This form is used by the contractor to indicate that preshipment inspection and servicing of each vehicle has been performed. The contractor is required to complete GSA Form 1398 (illustrated at Sec. 101-26.4902-1398) and affix it, preferably, to the lock face or door frame of the right front door after the final inspection. The form should be left in place during the warranty period to permit prompt identification of vehicles requiring dealer repairs pursuant to the warranty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard Form 368, Quality Deficiency Report (Category II). GSA is constantly striving to improve customer service and the quality of motor vehicles for which it contracts. To inform contractors of the deficiencies noted during the life of the vehicles, Standard Form 368 shall be prepared by the consignee and sent to GSA describing details of vehicle deficiency and action taken for correction. Procedures for documenting and reporting quality deficiencies are set forth in the GSA Publication ``Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material or Billings.'' Agencies are urged to report all deficiencies to GSA irrespective of satisfactory corrective action taken by the manufacturer's authorized dealer. If the dealer refuses to take corrective action on any vehicle within its warranty period, the report shall so state and include an explanation of circumstances. Standard Form 368 shall also be used to report all noncompliance with specifications or other requirements of the purchase order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Instructions to Consignee Receiving New Motor Vehicles Purchased by General Services Administration. This information is printed on the reverse of the consignee copy of the delivery order. Personnel responsible for receipt and operation of Government motor vehicles should be familiar with the instructions and information contained in the document entitled ``Instructions to Consignee Receiving New Motor Vehicles Purchased by General Services Administration.''
