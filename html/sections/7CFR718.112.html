                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A redetermination of crop acreage, appraised yield, or farm-stored production for a farm may be initiated by the county committee, State committee, or Deputy Administrator at any time. Redetermination may be requested by a producer with an interest in the farm if the producer pays the cost of the redetermination. The request must be submitted to FSA within 5 calendar days after the initial appraisal of the yield of a crop, or before the farm-stored production is removed from storage. A redeter mina tion will be undertaken in the manner prescribed by the Deputy Administrator. A redetermination will be used in lieu of any prior determination unless it is determined by the representative of the Deputy Administrator that there is good cause not to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FSA will refund the payment of the cost for a redetermination when, because of an error in the initial determination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appraised yield is changed by at least the larger of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Five percent or 5 pounds for cotton;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Five percent or 1 bushel for wheat, barley, oats, and rye; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Five percent or 2 bushels for corn and grain sorghum; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The farm stored production is changed by at least the smaller of 3 percent or 600 bushels; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The acreage of the crop is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Changed by at least the larger of 3 percent or 0.5 acre; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Considered to be within program requirements.
