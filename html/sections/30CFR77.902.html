                            <p class="depth0">On and after September 30, 1971, three-phase low- and medium-voltage resistance grounded systems to portable and mobile equipment shall include a fail safe ground check circuit or other no less effective device approved by the Secretary to monitor continuously the grounding circuit to assure continuity. The fail safe ground check circuit shall cause the circuit breaker to open when either the ground or pilot check wire is broken. Cable couplers shall be constructed to cause the ground check continuity conductor to break first and the ground conductor last when being uncoupled when pilot check circuits are used.


Sec. 77.902-1  Fail safe ground check circuits; maximum voltage.</p><p class="depth0">The maximum voltage used for ground check circuits under Sec. 77.902 shall not exceed 40 volts.


Sec. 77.902-2  Approved ground check systems not employing pilot checkwires.</p><p class="depth0">Ground check systems not employing pilot check wires shall be approved by the Secretary only after it has been determined that the system includes a fail safe design causing the circuit breaker to open when ground continuity is broken.


Sec. 77.902-3  Attachment of ground conductors and ground check wires to equipment frames; use of separate connections.</p><p class="depth0">In grounding the frames of stationary, portable, or mobile equipment

receiving power from resistance grounded systems, separate connections shall be used.</p>
