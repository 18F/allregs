                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, you may not export, reexport or transfer (in-country) microprocessors (``microprocessor microcircuits,'' ``microcomputer microcircuits,'' and microcontroller microcircuits having a processing speed of 5 GFLOPS or more and an

arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more, including those incorporating ``information security'' functionality), or associated ``software'' and ``technology'' for the ``production'' or ``development'' of such microprocessors without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country), you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be or is intended to be used for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1 (see supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or by a 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by BIS. BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the end uses or end users described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or transferor from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License review standards. There is a presumption of denial for applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) items subject to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Military end-use. In this section, the phrase `military end use' means incorporation into: a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at http://www.wassenaar.org); commodities classified under ECCNs ending in ``A018'' or under ``600 series'' ECCNs; or any commodity that is designed for the ``use,'' ``development,'' ``production,'' or deployment of military items described on the USML, the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List or classified under ECCNs ending in ``A018'' or under ``600 series'' ECCNs. supplement No. 1 of this part lists examples of 'military end use.'</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Military end user. In this section, the term 'military end user' means the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations, or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support 'military end uses' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions. The prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section supersede any license exception or No License Required (NLR) designation that would otherwise apply to a transaction subject to the EAR, except that this license requirement does not apply to exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items for or on behalf of the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or to agencies of a cooperating government authorized by License Exception GOV pursuant to Sec. 740.11 of the EAR. See Sec. 740.11(b)(1) of the EAR for the definition of 'agency of the U.S. Government' and Sec. 740.11(c)(1) for the definition of 'agency of a cooperating government.'
