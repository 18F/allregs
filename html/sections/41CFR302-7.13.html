                            <p class="depth0">HHG should be shipped by the most economical method available. The various methods of shipment and weight calculations include the following:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Uncrated (shipped in HHG        An allowance of up to 2,000 pounds,</p><p class="depth2">movers van or similar conveyance).  exclusive of the 18,000 pounds net</p><p class="depth2">weight of HHG shipment, is used for</p><p class="depth2">the packing weight covering</p><p class="depth2">barrels, boxes, cartons, and</p><p class="depth2">similar material but does not</p><p class="depth2">include pads, chains, dollies and</p><p class="depth2">other equipment to load and secure</p><p class="depth2">the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crated shipments..............  When crated the net weight will not</p><p class="depth2">include the weight of the crating</p><p class="depth2">material. The net weight will be</p><p class="depth2">computed as being 60 percent of the</p><p class="depth2">gross weight. However, if the net</p><p class="depth2">weight computed in this manner</p><p class="depth2">exceeds the applicable weight</p><p class="depth2">limitation and if it is determined</p><p class="depth2">that, for reasons beyond the</p><p class="depth2">employee's control, unusually heavy</p><p class="depth2">crating and packing materials were</p><p class="depth2">necessarily used, the net weight</p><p class="depth2">may be computed at less than 60</p><p class="depth2">percent of the gross weight.(c) Containerized shipments         When the known tare weight does not</p><p class="depth2">(Special containers designed,       include the weight of interior</p><p class="depth2">e.g., lift vans, CONEX              bracing and padding materials but</p><p class="depth2">transporters, HHG shipping boxes,   only the weight of the container,</p><p class="depth2">for repeated use).                  the net weight will be 85 percent</p><p class="depth2">of the gross weight less the weight</p><p class="depth2">of the container. If the known tare</p><p class="depth2">weight includes such material, so</p><p class="depth2">that the net weight is the same as</p><p class="depth2">it would be for uncrated shipments</p><p class="depth2">in interstate commerce, the net</p><p class="depth2">weight will not be subject to</p><p class="depth2">reduction.(d) Constructive weight...........  If adequate scales are not available</p><p class="depth2">at origin, en route or at</p><p class="depth2">destination, a constructive weight</p><p class="depth2">based on 7 pounds per cubic foot of</p><p class="depth2">properly loaded van space may be</p><p class="depth2">used. Such weight may be used for a</p><p class="depth2">part-load when its weight could not</p><p class="depth2">be obtained, without first</p><p class="depth2">unloading it or other part-loads</p><p class="depth2">being carried in the same vehicle</p><p class="depth2">or when the HHG are not weighed</p><p class="depth2">because the carrier's charges for</p><p class="depth2">local or metropolitan area moves</p><p class="depth2">are properly computed on the basis</p><p class="depth2">other than weight or volume of the</p><p class="depth2">shipment (as when payment is based</p><p class="depth2">on an hourly rate and distance</p><p class="depth2">involved). In such instances a</p><p class="depth2">statement from the carrier showing</p><p class="depth2">the properly loaded van space</p><p class="depth2">required for the shipment should be</p><p class="depth2">obtained with respect to proof of</p><p class="depth2">entitlement to a commuted rate</p><p class="depth2">payment when net weight cannot be</p><p class="depth2">shown.------------------------------------------------------------------------
