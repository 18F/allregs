                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance work is not airport development as defined in the Federal Airport Act and is not eligible for inclusion in the Program. Therefore, it is necessary in many cases that a determination be made whether particular proposed development is maintenance or repair. For the purpose of these determinations, maintenance includes any regular or recurring work necessary to preserve existing airport facilities in good condition, any work involved in cleaning or caring for existing airport facilities, and any incidental or minor repair work on existing airport facilities, such as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mowing and fertilizing of turfed areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trimming and replacing of land- scaping material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cleaning of drainage systems including ditches, pipes, catch basins, and replacing and restoring eroded

areas, except when caused by act of God or improper design;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Painting of buildings (inside and outside) and replacement of damaged items normally anticipated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Repairing and replacing burned out or broken fixtures and cables, unless major reconstruction is needed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Paving repairs in localized areas, except where the size of the work is such that it constitutes a major repair item or is part of a reconstruction project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Refilling joints and resealing surface of pavements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repair includes any work not included in paragraph (a) of this section that is necessary to restore existing airport facilities to good condition or preserve them in good condition.</p>
