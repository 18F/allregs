The applicant shall submit to the Food  and Drug Administration at the specified times two copies of the  following reports:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NDA--Field alert report. The applicant shall submit information  of the following kinds about distributed drug products and articles to  the FDA district office that is responsible for the facility involved  within 3 working days of receipt by the applicant. The information may  be provided by telephone or other rapid communication means, with prompt  written followup. The report and its mailing cover should be plainly  marked: ``NDA--Field Alert Report.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Information concerning any incident that causes the drug product  or its labeling to be mistaken for, or applied to, another article.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Information concerning any bacteriological contamination, or  any significant chemical, physical, or other change or deterioration in  the distributed drug product, or any failure of one or more distributed  batches of the drug product to meet the specification established for it  in the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual report. The applicant shall submit each year within 60  days of the anniversary date of U.S. approval of the application, two  copies of the report to the FDA division responsible for reviewing the  application. Each annual report is required to be accompanied by a  completed transmittal Form FDA 2252 (Transmittal of Periodic Reports for  Drugs for Human Use), and must include all the information required  under this section that the applicant received or otherwise obtained  during the annual reporting interval that ends on the U.S. anniversary  date. The report is required to contain in the order listed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Summary. A brief summary of significant new information from the  previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling  of the drug product. The report is also required to contain a brief  description of actions the applicant has taken or intends to take as a  result of this new information, for example, submit a labeling  supplement, add a warning to the labeling, or initiate a new study. The  summary shall briefly state whether labeling supplements for pediatric  use have been submitted and whether new studies in the pediatric  population to support appropriate labeling for the pediatric population  have been initiated. Where possible, an estimate of patient exposure to  the drug product, with special reference to the pediatric population  (neonates, infants, children, and adolescents) shall be provided,  including dosage form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> Distribution data. Information about the quantity of the  drug product distributed under the approved application, including that  distributed to distributors.

The schedule should include the actual or projected dates  for submission of the study protocol to FDA, completion of patient  accrual or initiation of an animal study, completion of the study,  submission of the final study report to FDA, and any additional  milestones or submissions for which projected dates were specified as  part of the commitment. In addition, it should include a revised  schedule, as appropriate. If the schedule has been previously revised,  provide both the original schedule and the most recent, previously  submitted revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Current status of the postmarketing study commitment. The status  of each postmarketing study should be categorized using one of the  following terms that describes the study's status on the anniversary  date of U.S. approval of the application or other agreed upon date:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pending. The study has not been initiated, but does not meet the  criterion for delayed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ongoing. The study is proceeding according to or ahead of the  original schedule described under paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(a)(7) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Delayed.

For all reports  required by this section, the applicant shall submit the information  common to more than one application only to the application first  approved, and shall not report separately on each application. The  submission is required to identify all the applications to which the  report applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Patient identification. Applicants should not include in reports  under this section the names and addresses of individual patients;  instead, the applicant should code the patient names whenever possible  and retain the code in the applicant's files. The applicant shall  maintain sufficient patient identification information to permit FDA, by  using that information alone or along with records maintained by the  investigator of a study, to identify the name and address of individual  patients; this will ordinarily occur only when the agency needs to  investigate the reports further or when there is reason to believe that  the reports do not represent actual results obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Withdrawal of approval. If an applicant fails to make reports  required under this section, FDA may withdraw approval of the  application and, thus, prohibit continued marketing of the drug product  that is the subject of the application.
