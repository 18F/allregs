it through appropriate acquisition channels, including the HCA, to the suspending official in accordance with 309.470-1. The suspending official shall initiate an investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision making process. The suspending official shall review the results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination whether or not suspension shall occur. ASFR/OGAPA/DA shall send a copy of the determination through appropriate acquisition channels to the initiating official and the Contracting Officer. If the suspending official determines that suspension is necessary, the suspending official shall consult with OGC-GLD and then notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c). If the action is not based on an indictment, and, subject to the provisions of FAR 9.407-3(b) (2), the contractor's submission in response to the notice raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, the suspending official shall, after imposing the suspension, arrange for fact-finding hearings and take the necessary actions specified in FAR 9.407-3(b)(2).</p>
