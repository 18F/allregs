Further, it  is essential that the candidate Sea Grant Consortium be required to  provide all three services as soon as possible after designation.  Further, such association or alliance must demonstrate that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It has been established for the purpose of sharing expertise,  research, educational facilities, or training facilities, and other  capabilities in order to facilitate research, education, training, and  advisory services in any field related to ocean, Great Lakes, and  coastal resources; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It will encourage and follow a regional multi-State approach to  solving problems or meeting needs relating to ocean, Great Lakes, and  coastal resources, in cooperation with appropriate Sea Grant Colleges,  Sea Grant Programs and other persons in the region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Although it is recognized that the distribution of effort  between research,   education, training, and advisory services to achieve appropriate  balance in a Sea Grant Regional Consortium may differ from a Sea Grant  College, sustained effort in all of these areas is, nonetheless, an  essential requirement for retention of such designation. To be eligible  for designation as a Sea Grant Regional Consortium, the candidate  association or alliance of organizations must meet the qualifications  set forth above as evaluated by a site review team composed of members  of the Sea Grant Review Panel, the Office of Sea Grant, and other  experts. Further, the candidate must be rated highly in all of the  following qualifying areas which are pertinent to the Consortium's  program:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Leadership. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate must  have achieved recognition as an intellectual and practical leader in  marine science, engineering, education, and advisory service in its  region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organization. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate must  have created the management organization to carry on a viable and  productive multidisciplinary Sea Grant Program and have the backing of  the administrations of its component organizations at a sufficiently  high level to fulfill its multidisciplinary and multifaceted mandate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Relevance. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate's Sea  Grant Program must be relevant to regional opportunities and problems in  the marine environment. Important factors in evaluating relevance are  the extent and depth of the need of a region for a focused marine  resource emphasis and the degree to which the candidate has developed  its capability to be responsive to that need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Education and training. Education and training must be clearly  relevant to regional needs and must be of high quality in fields related  to ocean, Great Lakes, and coastal resources. As appropriate, education  may include precollege, college, post-graduate, public and adult levels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Advisory services. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate  must have a strong program through which information techniques, and  research results from any reliable source, domestic or international,  may be communicated to and utilized by user communities. In addition to  the educational and information dissemination role, the advisory service  program must aid in the identification and communication of user  communities' research and educational needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Relationships. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate must  have close ties with federal agencies, state agencies and  administrations, regional authorities, regional business and industry,  and other regional educational institutions. These regional ties are:  (i) To ensure the relevance of programs, (ii) to generate requests for  such assistance as the consortium may offer, and (iii) to assist others  in developing research and management competence. The extent and quality  of a candidate's relationships are critical factors in evaluating the  proposed designation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Productivity. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate must  have demonstrated a degree of productivity (of research results,  reports, employed students, service to regional agencies, industry,  etc.) commensurate with the length of its Sea Grant operations and the  level of funding under which it has worked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Support. The Sea Grant Regional Consortium candidate must have  the ability to obtain matching funds from non-Federal sources, such as  State legislatures, university management, State agencies, and business  and industry. A diversity of matching funds sources is encouraged as a  sign of program vitality and the ability to meet the Sea Grant  requirement that funds for the general programs be matched with at least  one non-Federal dollar for every two Federal dollars.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Finally, it must be found that the Sea Grant Regional Consortium  candidate will act in accordance with the following standards relating  to its continuing responsibilities as a Sea Grant Regional Consortium:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continue pursuit of excellence and high performance in marine  research education, training, and advisory services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide regional leadership in marine activities including  coordinated planning and cooperative work with   local, State, regional, and Federal agencies, other Sea Grant Programs,  and non-Sea Grant organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain an effective management framework and application of  organizational resources to the achievement of Sea Grant objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Develop and implement long-term plans for research, education,  training, and advisory services consistent with Sea Grant goals and  objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Advocate and further the Sea Grant concept and the full  development of its potential within the consortium and the region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide adequate and stable matching financial support for the  program from non-Federal sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Establish and operate an effective system to control the quality  of its Sea Grant program.</p>
