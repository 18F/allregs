Ten business days prior to the completion of installation, the installer must arrange for a third-party inspection of the work performed, in accordance with subpart F of this part, unless the installer and retailer who contracted with the purchaser for the sale of the home agree, in writing, that during the same time period the retailer will arrange for the inspection. Such inspection must be performed as soon as practicable by an inspector who meets the qualifications set forth in Sec. 3286.511. The scope of the inspections that are required to be performed is addressed in Sec. 3286.505.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contract rights not affected. Failure to arrange for an inspection of a home within 5 business days will not affect the validity or enforceability of any sale or contract for the sale of any manufactured home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State or local permits. The licensed installer should obtain all necessary permits required under state or local laws.</p>
