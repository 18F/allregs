                                Sec. 390.463  Individual minimum capital requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The rules and procedures specified in this  section apply to the establishment of an individual minimum capital  requirement for a State savings association that varies from the risk- based capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement or the  tangible capital requirement that would otherwise apply to the State  savings association under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appropriate considerations for establishing individual minimum  capital requirements. Minimum capital levels higher than the risk-based  capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement or the tangible  capital requirement required under this subpart may be appropriate for  individual State savings associations. Increased individual minimum  capital requirements may be established upon a determination that the  State savings association's capital is or may become inadequate in view  of its circumstances. For example, higher capital levels may be  appropriate for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State savings association receiving special supervisory  attention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State savings association that has or is expected to have  losses resulting in capital inadequacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State savings association that has a high degree of exposure  to interest rate risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, concentration of  credit risk, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, or  similar risks; or a high proportion of off-balance sheet risk,  especially standby letters of credit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A State savings association that has poor liquidity or cash  flow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State savings association growing, either internally or  through acquisitions, at such a rate that supervisory problems are  presented that are not dealt with adequately by other FDIC regulations  or other guidance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A State savings association that may be adversely affected by  the activities or condition of its holding company, affiliate(s),  subsidiaries, or other persons or State savings associations with which  it has significant business relationships, including concentrations of  credit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A State savings association with a portfolio reflecting weak  credit quality or a significant likelihood of financial loss, or that  has loans in nonperforming status or on which borrowers fail to comply  with repayment terms;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A State savings association that has inadequate underwriting  policies, standards, or procedures for its loans and investments; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A State savings association that has a record of operational  losses that exceeds the average of other, similarly situated State  savings associations; has management deficiencies, including failure to  adequately monitor and control financial and operating risks,  particularly the risks presented by   concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities; or has a poor  record of supervisory compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards for determination of appropriate individual minimum  capital requirements. The appropriate minimum capital level for an  individual State savings association cannot be determined solely through  the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective  criteria. The decision is necessarily based, in part, on subjective  judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in  the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditions or circumstances leading to the determination  that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate or necessary  for the State savings association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects  of the State savings association and, if applicable, its holding  company, subsidiaries, and affiliates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The State savings association's liquidity, capital and other  indicators of financial stability, particularly as compared with those  of similarly situated State savings associations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The policies and practices of the State savings association's  directors, officers, and senior management as well as the internal  control and internal audit systems for implementation of such adopted  policies and practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification. When the FDIC determines that a  minimum capital requirement is necessary or appropriate for a particular  State savings association, it shall notify the State savings association  in writing of its proposed individual minimum capital requirement; the  schedule for compliance with the new requirement; and the specific  causes for determining that the higher individual minimum capital  requirement is necessary or appropriate for the State savings  association. The FDIC shall forward the notifying letter to the  appropriate state supervisor if a state-chartered savings association  would be subject to an individual minimum capital requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Response. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The response shall include any information that  the State savings association wants the FDIC to consider in deciding  whether to establish or to amend an individual minimum capital  requirement for the State savings association, what the individual  capital requirement should be, and, if applicable, what compliance  schedule is appropriate for achieving the required capital level. The  responses of the State savings association and appropriate state  supervisor must be in writing and must be delivered to the FDIC within  30 days after the date on which the notification was received. Such  response must be filed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 390.106 and  390.108. The FDIC may extend the time period for good cause. The time  period for response by the insured State savings association may be  shortened for good cause:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When, in the opinion of the FDIC, the condition of the State  savings association so requires, and the FDIC informs the State savings  association of the shortened response period in the notice;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> With the consent of the State savings association; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When the State savings association already has advised the FDIC  that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital  requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to respond within 30 days, or such other time period as  may be specified by the FDIC, may constitute a waiver of any objections  to the proposed individual minimum capital requirement or to the  schedule for complying with it, unless the FDIC has provided an  extension of the response period for good cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decision. After expiration of the response period, the FDIC  shall decide whether or not it believes the proposed individual minimum  capital requirement should be established for the State savings  association, or whether that proposed requirement should be adopted in  modified form, based on a review of the State savings association's  response and other relevant information. The FDIC's decision shall  address comments received within the response period from the State  savings association and the appropriate state supervisor and shall state  the level of capital required, the schedule for compliance with this  requirement, and any   specific remedial action the State savings association could take to  eliminate the need for continued applicability of the individual minimum  capital requirement. The FDIC shall provide the State savings  association and the appropriate state supervisor with a written decision  on the individual minimum capital requirement, addressing the  substantive comments made by the State savings association and setting  forth the decision and the basis for that decision. Upon receipt of this  decision by the State savings association, the individual minimum  capital requirement becomes effective and binding upon the State savings  association. This decision represents final agency action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to comply. Failure to satisfy an individual minimum  capital requirement, or to meet any required incremental additions to  capital under a schedule for compliance with such an individual minimum  capital requirement, shall constitute a legal basis for issuing a  capital directive pursuant to Sec. 390.464.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Change in circumstances. If, after a decision is made under  paragraph (d)(3) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances  affecting the State savings association's capital adequacy or its  ability to reach its required minimum capital level by the specified  date, FDIC may amend the individual minimum capital requirement or the  State savings association's schedule for such compliance. The FDIC may  decline to consider a State savings association's request for such  changes that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or  that are repetitive or frivolous. Pending the FDIC's reexamination of  the original decision, that original decision and any compliance  schedule established thereunder shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
