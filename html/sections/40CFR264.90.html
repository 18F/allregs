                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the  regulations in this subpart apply to owners or operators of facilities  that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The owner or operator  must satisfy the requirements identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section for all wastes (or constituents thereof) contained in solid  waste management units at the facility, regardless of the time at which  waste was placed in such units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All solid waste management units must comply with the  requirements in Sec. 264.101. A surface impoundment, waste pile, and  land treatment unit or landfill that receives hazardous waste after July  26, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as a ``regulated unit'') must comply  with the requirements of Secs. 264.91 through 264.100 in lieu of  Sec. 264.101 for purposes of detecting, characterizing and responding to  releases to the uppermost aquifer. The financial responsibility  requirements of Sec. 264.101 apply to regulated units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator's regulated unit or units are not subject  to regulation for releases into the uppermost aquifer under this subpart  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator is exempted under Sec. 264.1; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> He operates a unit which the Regional Administrator finds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is an engineered structure,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Does not receive or contain liquid waste or waste containing  free liquids,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is designed and operated to exclude liquid, precipitation, and  other run-on and run-off,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Has both inner and outer layers of containment enclosing the  waste,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Has a leak detection system built into each containment layer,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator will provide continuing operation and  maintenance of these leak detection systems during the active life of  the unit and the closure and post-closure care periods, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> To a reasonable degree of certainty, will not allow hazardous  constituents to migrate beyond the outer containment layer prior to the  end of the post-closure care period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Regional Administrator finds, pursuant to Sec. 264.280(d),  that the treatment zone of a land treatment unit that qualifies as a  regulated unit does not contain levels of hazardous constituents that  are above background levels of those constituents by an amount that is  statistically significant, and if an unsaturated zone monitoring program  meeting the requirements of Sec. 264.278 has not shown a statistically  significant increase in hazardous constituents below the treatment zone  during the operating life of the unit. An exemption under this paragraph  can only relieve an owner or operator of responsibility to meet the  requirements of this subpart during the post-closure care period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Regional Administrator finds that there is no potential for  migration of liquid from a regulated unit to the uppermost aquifer  during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure  period) and the post-closure care period specified under Sec. 264.117.  This demonstration must be certified by a qualified geologist or  geotechnical engineer. In order to provide an adequate margin of safety  in the prediction of potential migration of liquid, the owner or  operator must base any predictions made under this paragraph on  assumptions that maximize the rate of liquid migration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> He designs and operates a pile in compliance with  Sec. 264.250(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The regulations under this subpart apply during the active life  of the regulated unit (including the closure period). After closure of  the regulated unit, the regulations in this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Do not apply if all waste, waste residues, contaminated  containment system components, and contaminated subsoils are removed or  decontaminated at closure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apply during the post-closure care period under Sec. 264.117 if  the owner or operator is conducting a detection monitoring program under  Sec. 264.98; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Apply during the compliance period under Sec. 264.96 if the  owner or operator is conducting a compliance monitoring program under  Sec. 264.99 or a corrective action program under Sec. 264.100.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regulations in this subpart may apply to miscellaneous units  when necessary to comply with Secs. 264.601 through 264.603.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The regulations of this subpart apply to all owners and  operators subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7), when the  Agency issues either a post-closure permit or an enforceable document  (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) at the facility. When the Agency  issues an enforceable document, references in this subpart to ``in the  permit'' mean ``in the enforceable document.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Regional Administrator may replace all or part of the  requirements of Secs. 264.91 through 264.100 applying to a regulated  unit with alternative requirements for groundwater monitoring and  corrective action for releases to groundwater set out in the permit (or  in an enforceable document) (as defined in 40 CFR 270.1(c)(7)) where the  Regional Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulated unit is situated among solid waste management  units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both the  regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas  of concern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not necessary to apply the groundwater monitoring and  corrective action requirements of Secs. 264.91 through 264.100 because  alternative requirements will protect human health and the environment.
