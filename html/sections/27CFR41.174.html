                            <p class="depth0">When the appropriate TTB officer is assigned to verify the schedule and supervise destruction or other disposition of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes which have been imported or brought into the United States, such officer shall, upon completion of his assignment, execute a certificate on all copies of the schedule to show the disposition and the date of disposition of such articles. The appropriate TTB officer shall return the original and one copy of the certified schedule to the taxpayer. When a taxpayer destroys such articles (and stamps, if any) or reduces tobacco products to materials, or a receiving manufacturer verifies the schedule and disposition of such articles (and stamps, if any), he shall execute a certificate on the original and the copy of the schedule returned to him, to show the disposition and the date of disposition of the articles. The taxpayer shall attach the original of the certified schedule to his claim for refund.
