unsafe for use  under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its  proposed labeling or the results do not show that the drug product is  safe for use under those conditions.</p><p

proposed labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> There is a lack of substantial evidence consisting of adequate  and well-controlled investigations, as defined in Sec. 314.126, that  the drug product will have the effect it purports or is represented to  have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested  in its proposed labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The application contains an untrue statement of a material fact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The

recommended, or suggested in its  proposed labeling was not conducted in compliance with the good  laboratory practice regulations in part 58 of this chapter and no reason  for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the differences between  the practices used in conducting the study and the good laboratory  practice regulations do not support the validity of the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Any clinical investigation involving human subjects described  in the application, subject to the institutional review board  regulations in part 56 of this chapter or informed consent regulations  in part 50 of this chapter, was not conducted in compliance with those  regulations such that the rights or safety of human subjects were not  adequately protected.</p><p
