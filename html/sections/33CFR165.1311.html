                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulated area. A regulated navigation area is established on  that portion of Commencement Bay bounded by a line beginning at:  471540.19753" N, 1222609.27617" W; thence to 471542.21070" N,  1222610.65290" W; thence to 471541.84696" N, 1222611.80062" W;  thence to 471545.57725" N, 1222614.35173" W; thence to  471553.06020" N, 1222606.61366" W; thence to 471546.74493" N,  1222602.50574" W; thence returning along the shoreline to the point of  origin. [Datum NAD 1983].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regulations. All vessels and persons are prohibited from  anchoring, dredging, laying cable, dragging, seining, bottom fishing,  conducting salvage operations, or any other activity which could  potentially disturb the seabed in the designated area. Vessels may  otherwise transit or navigate within this area without reservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver. The Captain of the Port, Puget Sound, upon advice from  the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Project  Manager and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, may,  upon written request, authorize a waiver from this section if it is  determined that the proposed operation supports USEPA remedial  objectives, or can be performed in a manner that ensures the integrity  of the sediment cap. A written request must describe the intended  operation, state the need, and describe the proposed precautionary  measures. Requests shall be submitted in triplicate, to facilitate  review by USEPA, Coast Guard, and Washington State Agencies. USEPA  managed remedial design, remedial action, habitat mitigation, or  monitoring activities associated with the Olympic View Resource Area  Superfund Site are excluded from the waiver requirement. USEPA is  required, however, to alert the Coast Guard in advance concerning any of  the above-mentioned activities that   may, or will, take place in the Regulated Area.
