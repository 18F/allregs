                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> FDIC consent by order or notice. An insured State bank that previously filed an application or notice under part 362 in effect prior to January 1, 1999 (see 12 CFR part 362 revised as of January 1, 1998), and obtained the FDIC's consent to engage in an activity or to acquire or retain a majority-owned subsidiary engaging as principal in an activity or acquiring and retaining any investment that is prohibited under this subpart may continue that activity or retain that investment without seeking the FDIC's consent, provided that the insured State bank and its subsidiary, if applicable, continue to meet the conditions and restrictions of the approval. An insured State bank which was granted approval based on conditions which differ from the requirements of Sec. 362.4(c)(2), (d) and (e) will be considered to meet the conditions and restrictions of the approval relating to being an eligible subsidiary, meeting investment and transactions limits, and meeting capital requirements if the insured State bank and subsidiary meet the requirements of Sec. 362.4(c)(2), (d) and (e). If the majority-owned subsidiary is engaged in real estate investment activities not exceeding 2 percent of the tier one capital of a bank and meeting the other conditions of Sec. 362.4(b)(5)(i), the majority-owned subsidiary's compliance with Sec. 362.4(c)(2) under the preceding sentence may be pursuant to the modifications authorized by Sec. 362.4(b)(5)(i). Once an insured State bank elects to comply with Sec. 362.4 (c)(2), (d), and (e), it may not revert to the corresponding provisions of the approval order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Approvals by regulation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)-(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adjustable rate or money market preferred stock. An insured State bank owning adjustable rate or money market (auction rate) preferred stock pursuant to Sec. 362.4(c)(3)(v) in effect prior to January 1, 1999 (see 12 CFR part 362 revised as of January 1, 1998), in excess of the amount limit in Sec. 362.3(b)(2)(iii) may continue to hold any overlimit shares of such stock acquired before January 1, 1999, until redeemed or repurchased by the issuer, but such stock shall be included as part of the amount limit in Sec. 362.3(b)(2)(iii) when determining whether the bank may acquire new stock thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Charter conversions. (1) An insured State bank that has converted its charter from an insured state savings association may continue activities through a majority-owned subsidiary that were permissible prior to the time it converted its charter only if the insured State bank receives the FDIC's consent. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the insured State bank should apply under Sec. 362.4(b)(1), submit any notice required under Sec. 362.4(b) (4) or (5), or comply with the provisions of Sec. 362.4(b) (3), (6), or (7) if applicable, to continue the activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An insured State bank that has converted its charter from an insured state savings association may continue activities through a majority-owned subsidiary that were permissible prior to the time it converted its charter only if the insured State bank receives the FDIC's consent.

If the FDIC had granted consent to the savings association under section 28 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831(e)) prior to the time the savings association converted its charter, the insured State bank may continue the activities without providing notice or making application to the FDIC, provided that the bank and its subsidiary as applicable are in compliance with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The terms of the FDIC approval order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of Sec. 362.4(c)(2), (d), and (e) regarding operating as an ``eligible subsidiary'', ``investment and transaction limits'', and ``capital requirements'.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Divestiture. An insured State bank that does not receive FDIC consent shall divest of the nonconforming investment as soon as practical but in no event later than two years from the date of charter conversion.
