Substance Identification</p><p class="depth0">A. Substance: Benzene.</p><p class="depth0">B. Permissible Exposure: Except as to the use of gasoline, motor  fuels and other fuels subsequent to discharge from bulk terminals and  other exemptions specified inSec. 1910.1028(a)(2):</p><p class="depth0">1. Airborne: The maximum time-weighted average (TWA) exposure limit  is 1 part of benzene vapor per million parts of air (1 ppm) for an 8- hour workday and the maximum short-term exposure limit (STEL) is 5 ppm  for any 15-minute period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Dermal: Eye contact shall be prevented and skin contact with  liquid benzene shall be limited.</p><p class="depth0">C. Appearance and odor: Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a  pleasant, sweet odor. The odor of benzene does not provide adequate  warning of its hazard.</p><p class="depth0">II. Health Hazard Data</p><p class="depth0">A. Ways in which benzene affects your health. Benzene can affect  your health if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin  or eyes. Benzene is also harmful if you happen to swallow it.</p><p class="depth0">B. Effects of overexposure. 1. Short-term (acute) overexposure: If  you are overexposed to high concentrations of benzene, well above the  levels where its odor is first recognizable, you may feel breathless,  irritable, euphoric, or giddy; you may experience irritation in eyes,  nose, and respiratory tract. You may develop a headache, feel dizzy,  nauseated, or intoxicated. Severe exposures may lead to convulsions and  loss of consciousness.</p><p class="depth0">2. Long-term (chronic) exposure. Repeated or prolonged exposure to  benzene, even at relatively low concentrations, may result in various  blood disorders, ranging from anemia to leukemia, an irreversible, fatal  disease. Many blood disorders associated with benzene exposure may occur  without symptoms.</p><p class="depth0">III. Protective Clothing and Equipment</p><p class="depth0">A. Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in  which engineering controls or work practice controls are not feasible to  reduce exposure to the permissible level. However, where employers can  document that benzene is present in the workplace less than 30 days a  year, respirators may be used in lieu of engineering controls. If  respirators are worn, they must have joint Mine Safety and Health  Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and  Health (NIOSH) seal of approval, and cartridge or canisters must be  replaced before the end of their service life, or the end of the shift,  whichever occurs first. If you experience difficulty breathing while  wearing a   respirator, you may request a positive pressure respirator from your  employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the assigned respirator,  and the training will be provided by your employer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Protective Clothing. You must wear appropriate protective  clothing (such as boots, gloves, sleeves, aprons, etc.) over any parts  of your body that could be exposed to liquid benzene.</p><p class="depth0">C. Eye and Face Protection. You must wear splash-proof safety  goggles if it is possible that benzene may get into your eyes. In  addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed  with benzene liquid.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Eye and face exposure. If benzene is splashed in your eyes, wash  it out immediately with large amounts of water. If irritation persists  or vision appears to be affected see a doctor as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">B. Skin exposure. If benzene is spilled on your clothing or skin,  remove the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large  amounts of water and soap immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before  you wear it again.</p><p class="depth0">C. Breathing. If you or any other person breathes in large amounts  of benzene, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply  artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical  assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or  confined space where the benzene concentration might be high without  proper safety equipment and at least one other person present who will  stay outside. A life line should be used.</p><p class="depth0">D. Swallowing. If benzene has been swallowed and the patient is  conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a  doctor immediately.</p><p class="depth0">V. Medical Requirements</p><p class="depth0">If you are exposed to benzene at a concentration at or above 0.5 ppm  as an 8-hour time-weighted average, or have been exposed at or above 10  ppm in the past while employed by your current employer, your employer  is required to provide a medical examination and history and laboratory  tests within 60 days of the effective date of this standard and annually  thereafter. These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In  addition, if you are accidentally exposed to benzene (either by  ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under emergency conditions  known or suspected to constitute toxic exposure to benzene, your  employer is required to make special laboratory tests available to you.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Observation of Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Your employer is required to perform measurements that are  representative of your exposure to benzene and you or your designated  representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are  entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure, and to  record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking  place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and  equipment are required to be worn, you or your representative must also  be provided with, and must wear the protective clothing and equipment.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Access to Records</p><p class="depth0">You or your representative are entitled to see the records of  measurements of your exposure to benzene upon written request to your  employer. Your medical examination records can be furnished to yourself,  your physician or designated representative upon request by you to your  employer.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling and Storage</p><p class="depth0">Benzene liquid is highly flammable. It should be stored in tightly  closed containers in a cool, well ventilated area. Benzene vapor may  form explosive mixtures in air. All sources of ignition must be  controlled. Use nonsparking tools when opening or closing benzene  containers. Fire extinguishers, where provided, must be readily  available. Know where they are located and how to operate them. Smoking  is prohibited in areas where benzene is used or stored. Ask your  supervisor where benzene is used in your area and for additional plant  safety rules.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B toSec. 1910.1028--Substance Technical Guidelines, Benzene</p><p class="depth0">I.

Fine water spray can  be used to keep fire-exposed containers cool.</p><p class="depth0">6. Unusual fire and explosion hazards: Benzene is a flammable  liquid. Its vapors can form explosive mixtures. All ignition sources  must be controlled when benzene is used, handled, or stored. Where  liquid or vapor may be released, such areas shall be considered as  hazardous locations. Benzene vapors are heavier than air; thus the  vapors may travel along the ground and be ignited by open flames or  sparks at locations remote from the site at which benzene is handled.</p><p class="depth0">7. Benzene is classified as a 1 B flammable liquid for the purpose  of conforming to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. A concentration  exceeding 3,250 ppm is considered a potential fire explosion hazard.  Locations where benzene may be present in quantities sufficient to  produce explosive or ignitable mixtures are considered Class I Group D  for the purposes of conforming to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.309.</p><p class="depth0">B. Reactivity.</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions contributing to instability: Heat.</p><p class="depth0">2. Incompatibility: Heat and oxidizing materials.</p><p class="depth0">3. Hazardous decomposition products: Toxic gases and vapors (such as  carbon monoxide).</p><p class="depth0">III. Spill and Leak Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. Steps to be taken if the material is released or spilled. As much  benzene as possible should be absorbed with suitable materials, such as  dry sand or earth. That remaining must be flushed with large amounts of  water. Do not flush benzene into a confined space, such as a sewer,  because of explosion danger. Remove all ignition sources. Ventilate  enclosed places.</p><p class="depth0">B. Waste disposal method. Disposal methods must conform to other  jurisdictional regulations. If allowed, benzene may be disposed of: (a)  By absorbing it in dry sand or earth and disposing in a sanitary  landfill; (b) if small quantities, by removing it to a safe location  from buildings or other combustible sources, pouring it in dry sand or  earth and cautiously igniting it; and (c) if large quantities, by  atomizing it in a suitable combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Miscellaneous Precautions</p><p class="depth0">A. High exposure to benzene can occur when transferring the liquid  from one container to another. Such operations should be well ventilated  and good work practices must be established to avoid spills.</p><p class="depth0">B. Use non-sparking tools to open benzene containers which are  effectively grounded and bonded prior to opening and pouring.</p><p class="depth0">C. Employers must advise employees of all plant areas and operations  where exposure to benzene could occur. Common operations in which high  exposures to benzene may be encountered are: the primary production and  utilization of benzene, and transfer of benzene.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C toSec. 1910.1028--Medical Surveillance Guidelines for</p><p class="depth0">Benzene</p><p class="depth0">I. Route of Entry</p><p class="depth0">Inhalation; skin absorption.</p><p class="depth0">II. Toxicology</p><p class="depth0">Benzene is primarily an inhalation hazard. Systemic absorption may  cause depression of the hematopoietic system, pancytopenia, aplastic  anemia, and leukemia. Inhalation of high concentrations can affect  central nervous system function. Aspiration of small amounts of liquid  benzene immediately causes pulmonary edema and hemorrhage of pulmonary  tissue. There is some absorption through the skin. Absorption may be  more rapid in the case of abraded skin, and benzene may be more readily  absorbed if it is present in a mixture or as a contaminant in solvents  which are readily absorbed. The defatting action of benzene may produce  primary irritation due to repeated or prolonged contact with the skin.  High concentration are irritating to the eyes and the mucuous membranes  of the nose, and respiratory tract.</p><p class="depth0">III. Signs and Symptoms</p><p class="depth0">Direct skin contact with benzene may cause erythema. Repeated or  prolonged contact may result in drying, scaling dermatitis, or  development of secondary skin infections. In addition, there is benzene  absorption through the skin. Local effects of benzene vapor or liquid on  the eye are slight. Only at very high concentrations is there any  smarting sensation in the eye. Inhalation of high concentrations of  benzene may have an initial stimulatory effect on the central nervous  system characterized by exhilaration, nervous excitation, and/or  giddiness, followed by a period of depression, drowsiness, or fatigue. A  sensation of tightness in the chest accompanied by breathlessness may  occur and ultimately the victim may lose consciousness. Tremors,  convulsions and death may follow from respiratory paralysis or  circulatory collapse in a few minutes to several hours following severe  exposures.</p><p class="depth0">The detrimental effect on the blood-forming system of prolonged  exposure to small   quantities of benzene vapor is of extreme importance. The hematopoietic  system is the chief target for benzene's toxic effects which are  manifested by alterations in the levels of formed elements in the  peripheral blood. These effects have occurred at concentrations of  benzene which may not cause irritation of mucous membranes, or any  unpleasant sensory effects. Early signs and symptoms of benzene  morbidity are varied, often not readily noticed and non-specific.  Subjective complaints of headache, dizziness, and loss of appetite may  precede or follow clinical signs. Rapid pulse and low blood pressure, in  addition to a physical appearance of anemia, may accompany a subjective  complaint of shortness of breath and excessive tiredness. Bleeding from  the nose, gums, or mucous membranes, and the development of purpuric  spots (small bruises) may occur as the condition progresses. Clinical  evidence of leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, singly or in  combination, has been frequently reported among the first signs.</p><p class="depth0">Bone marrow may appear normal, aplastic, or hyperplastic, and may  not, in all situations, correlate with peripheral blood forming tissues.  Because of variations in the susceptibility to benzene morbidity, there  is no ``typical'' blood picture. The onset of effects of prolonged  benzene exposure may be delayed for many months or years after the  actual exposure has ceased and identification or correlation with  benzene exposure must be sought out in the occupational history.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects</p><p class="depth0">Remove from exposure immediately. Make sure you are adequately  protected and do not risk being overcome by fumes. Give oxygen or  artificial resuscitation if indicated. Flush eyes, wash skin if  contaminated and remove all contaminated clothing. Symptoms of  intoxication may persist following severe exposures. Recovery from mild  exposures is usually rapid and complete.</p><p class="depth0">V. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">The principal effects of benzene exposure which form the basis for  this regulation are pathological changes in the hematopoietic system,  reflected by changes in the peripheral blood and manifesting clinically  as pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. Consequently, the  medical surveillance program is designed to observe, on a regular basis,  blood indices for early signs of these effects, and although early signs  of leukemia are not usually available, emerging diagnostic technology  and innovative regimes make consistent surveillance for leukemia, as  well as other hematopoietic effects, essential.</p><p class="depth0">Initial examinations are to be provided within 60 days of the  effective date of this standard, or at the time of initial assignment,  and periodic examinations annually thereafter. There are special  provisions for medical tests in the event of hematologic abnormalities  or for emergency situations.</p><p class="depth0">The blood values which require referral to a hematologist or  internist are noted in the standard in paragraph (i)(5). The standard  specifies that blood abnormalities that persist must be referred  ``unless the physician has good reason to believe such referral is  unnecessary'' (paragraph (i)(5)). Examples of conditions that could make  a referral unnecessary despite abnormal blood limits are iron or folate  deficiency, menorrhagia, or blood loss due to some unrelated medical  abnormality.</p><p class="depth0">Symptoms and signs of benzene toxicity can be non-specific. Only a  detailed history and appropriate investigative procedures will enable a  physician to rule out or confirm conditions that place the employee at  increased risk. To assist the examining physician with regard to which  laboratory tests are necessary and when to refer an employee to the  specialist, OSHA has established the following guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">B. Hematology Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">A minimum battery of tests is to be performed by strictly  standardized methods.</p><p class="depth0">1. Red cell, white cell, platelet counts, white blood cell  differential, hematacrit and red cell indices must be performed by an  accredited laboratory. The normal ranges for the red cell and white cell  counts are influenced by altitude, race, and sex, and therefore should  be determined by the accredited laboratory in the specific area where  the tests are performed.</p><p class="depth0">Either a decline from an absolute normal or an individual's base  line to a subnormal value or a rise to a supra-normal value, are  indicative of potential toxicity, particularly if all blood parameters  decline. The normal total white blood count is approximately 7,200/mm\3\  plus or minus 3,000. For cigarette smokers the white count may be higher  and the upper range may be 2,000 cells higher than normal for the  laboratory. In addition, infection, allergies and some drugs may raise  the white cell count. The normal platelet count is approximately 250,000  with a range of 140,000 to 400,000. Counts outside this range should be  regarded as possible evidence of benzene toxicity.</p><p class="depth0">Certain abnormalities found through routine screening are of greater  significance in the benzene-exposed worker and require prompt  consultation with a specialist, namely:</p><p class="depth0">a. Thrombocytopenia.</p><p class="depth0">b. A trend of decreasing white cell, red cell, or platelet indices  in an individual over time   is more worrisome than an isolated abnormal finding at one test time.  The importance of trend highlights the need to compare an individual's  test results to baseline and/or previous periodic tests.</p><p class="depth0">c. A constellation or pattern of abnormalities in the different  blood indices is of more significance than a single abnormality. A low  white count not associated with any abnormalities in other cell indices  may be a normal statistical variation, whereas if the low white count is  accompanied by decreases in the platelet and/or red cell indices, such a  pattern is more likely to be associated with benzene toxicity and merits  thorough investigation.</p><p class="depth0">Anemia, leukopenia, macrocytosis or an abnormal differential white  blood cell count should alert the physician to further investigate and/ or refer the patient if repeat tests confirm the abnormalities. If  routine screening detects an abnormality, follow-up tests which may be  helpful in establishing the etiology of the abnormality are the  peripheral blood smear and the reticulocyte count.</p><p class="depth0">The extreme range of normal for reticulocytes is 0.4 to 2.5 percent  of the red cells, the usual range being 0.5 to 1.2 percent of the red  cells, but the typical value is in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 percent. A  decline in reticulocytes to levels of less than 0.4 percent is to be  regarded as possible evidence (unless another specific cause is found)  of benzene toxicity requiring accelerated surveillance. An increase in  reticulocyte levels to about 2.5 percent may also be consistent with  (but is not as characteristic of) benzene toxicity.</p><p class="depth0">2. An important diagnostic test is a careful examination of the  peripheral blood smear. As with reticulocyte count the smear should be  with fresh uncoagulated blood obtained from a needle tip following  venipuncture or from a drop of earlobe blood (capillary blood). If  necessary, the smear may, under certain limited conditions, be made from  a blood sample anticoagulated with EDTA (but never with oxalate or  heparin). When the smear is to be prepared from a specimen of venous  blood which has been collected by a commercial Vacutainer [supreg] type  tube containing neutral EDTA, the smear should be made as soon as  possible after the venesection. A delay of up to 12 hours is permissible  between the drawing of the blood specimen into EDTA and the preparation  of the smear if the blood is stored at refrigerator (not freezing)  temperature.</p><p class="depth0">3. The minimum mandatory observations to be made from the smear are:</p><p class="depth0">a. The differential white blood cell count.</p><p class="depth0">b. Description of abnormalities in the appearance of red cells.</p><p class="depth0">c. Description of any abnormalities in the platelets.</p><p class="depth0">d. A careful search must be made throughout of every blood smear for  immature white cells such as band forms (in more than normal proportion,  i.e., over 10 percent of the total differential count), any number of  metamyelocytes, myelocytes or myeloblasts. Any nucleate or  multinucleated red blood cells should be reported. Large ``giant''  platelets or fragments of megakaryocytes must be recognized.</p><p class="depth0">An increase in the proportion of band forms among the neutrophilic  granulocytes is an abnormality deserving special mention, for it may  represent a change which should be considered as an early warning of  benzene toxicity in the absence of other causative factors (most  commonly infection). Likewise, the appearance of metamyelocytes, in the  absence of another probable cause, is to be considered a possible  indication of benzene-induced toxicity.</p><p class="depth0">An upward trend in the number of basophils, which normally do not  exceed about 2.0 percent of the total white cells, is to be regarded as  possible evidence of benzene toxicity. A rise in the eosinophil count is  less specific but also may be suspicious of toxicity if the rises above  6.0 percent of the total white count.</p><p class="depth0">The normal range of monocytes is from 2.0 to 8.0 percent of the  total white count with an average of about 5.0 percent. About 20 percent  of individuals reported to have mild but persisting abnormalities caused  by exposure to benzene show a persistent monocytosis. The findings of a  monocyte count which persists at more than 10 to 12 percent of the  normal white cell count (when the total count is normal) or persistence  of an absolute monocyte count in excess of 800/mm\3\ should be regarded  as a possible sign of benzene-induced toxicity.</p><p class="depth0">A less frequent but more serious indication of benzene toxicity is  the finding in the peripheral blood of the so-called ``pseudo'' (or  acquired) Pelger-Huet anomaly. In this anomaly many, or sometimes the  majority, of the neutrophilic granulocytes possess two round nuclear  segements--less often one or three round segments--rather than three  normally elongated segments. When this anomaly is not hereditary, it is  often but not invariably predictive of subsequent leukemia. However,  only about two percent of patients who ultimately develop acute  myelogenous leukemia show the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly. Other tests  that can be administered to investigate blood abnormalities are  discussed below; however, such procedures should be undertaken by the  hematologist.</p><p class="depth0">An uncommon sign, which cannot be detected from the smear, but can  be elicited by a ``sucrose water test'' of peripheral blood, is  transient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which may first  occur insidiously during a period of established aplastic anemia, and  may be followed within   one to a few years by the appearance of rapidly fatal acute myelogenous  leukemia. Clinical detection of PNH, which occurs in only one or two  percent of those destined to have acute myelogenous leukemia, may be  difficult; if the ``sucrose water test'' is positive, the somewhat more  definitive Ham test, also known as the acid-serum hemolysis test, may  provide confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Individuals documented to have developed acute myelogenous  leukemia years after initial exposure to benzene may have progressed  through a preliminary phase of hematologic abnormality. In some  instances pancytopenia (i.e., a lowering in the counts of all  circulating blood cells of bone marrow origin, but not to the extent  implied by the term ``aplastic anemia'') preceded leukemia for many  years. Depression of a single blood cell type or platelets may represent  a harbinger of aplasia or leukemia. The finding of two or more  cytopenias, or pancytopenia in a benzene-exposed individual, must be  regarded as highly suspicious of more advanced although still  reversible, toxicity. ``Pancytopenia'' coupled with the appearance of  immature cells (myelocytes, myeloblasts, erythroblasts, etc.), with  abnormal cells (pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly, atypical nuclear  heterochromatin, etc.), or unexplained elevations of white blood cells  must be regarded as evidence of benzene overexposure unless proved  otherwise. Many severely aplastic patients manifested the ominous  finding of 5-10 percent myeloblasts in the marrow, occasional  myeloblasts and myelocytes in the blood and 20-30% monocytes. It is  evident that isolated cytopenias, pancytopenias, and even aplastic  anemias induced by benzene may be reversible and complete recovery has  been reported on cessation of exposure. However, since any of these  abnormalities is serious, the employee must immediately be removed from  any possible exposure to benzene vapor. Certain tests may substantiate  the employee's prospects for progression or regression. One such test  would be an examination of the bone marrow, but the decision to perform  a bone marrow aspiration or needle biopsy is made by the hematologist.</p><p class="depth0">The findings of basophilic stippling in circulating red blood cells  (usually found in 1 to 5% of red cells following marrow injury), and  detection in the bone marrow of what are termed ``ringed sideroblasts''  must be taken seriously, as they have been noted in recent years to be  premonitory signs of subsequent leukemia.</p><p class="depth0">Recently peroxidase-staining of circulating or marrow neutrophil  granulocytes, employing benzidine dihydrochloride, have revealed the  disappearance of, or diminution in, peroxidase in a sizable proportion  of the granulocytes, and this has been reported as an early sign of  leukemia. However, relatively few patients have been studied to date.  Granulocyte granules are normally strongly peroxidase positive. A steady  decline in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase has also been reported as  suggestive of early acute leukemia. Exposure to benzene may cause an  early rise in serum iron, often but not always associated with a fall in  the reticulocyte count. Thus, serial measurements of serum iron levels  may provide a means of determining whether or not there is a trend  representing sustained suppression of erythropoiesis.</p><p class="depth0">Measurement of serum iron, determination of peroxidase and of  alkaline phosphatase activity in peripheral granulocytes can be  performed in most pathology laboratories. Peroxidase and alkaline  phosphatase staining are usually undertaken when the index of suspecion  for leukemia is high.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D toSec. 1910.1028--Sampling and Analytical Methods for</p><p class="depth0">Benzene Monitoring and Measurement Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure  to benzene are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour  exposure may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour  samples. Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used  to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements  are taken in a random manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling  means that any portion of the work shift has the same change of being  sampled as any other. The arithmetic average of all such random samples  taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of  exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the  employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that  inhaled by the employee). Sampling and analysis must be performed with  procedures meeting the requirements of the standard.</p><p class="depth0">There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee  exposures to benzene. The sampling and analysis may be performed by  collection of the benzene vaptor or charcoal absorption tubes, with  subsequent chemical analysis by gas chromatography. Sampling and  analysis may also be performed by portable direct reading instruments,  real-time continuous monitoring systems, passive dosimeters or other  suitable methods. The employer has the obligation of selecting a  monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of  the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires  that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent  confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for  concentrations of benzene greater than or equal to 0.5 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">The OSHA Laboratory modified NIOSH Method S311 and evaluated it at a  benzene air concentration of 1 ppm. A procedure for   determining the benzene concentration in bulk material samples was also  evalauted.

These two sections are  analyzed separately.</p><p class="depth0">5.4.2. Desorption of samples. Prior to analysis, 1.0 mL of desorbing  solution is pipetted into each sample container. The desorbing solution  consists of 0.05 [micro]L internal standard per mL of carbon disulfide.  The sample vials are capped as soon as the solvent is added.

The desorption efficiency of a  particular compound can vary from one laboratory to another and from one  lot of chemical to another. Thus, it is necessary to determine, at least  once, the percentage of the specific compound that is removed in the  desorption process, provided the same batch of charcoal is used.</p><p class="depth0">5.5.2. Procedure for determining desorption efficiency. The  reference portion of the charcoal tube is removed. To the remaining  portion, amounts representing 0.5X, 1X, and 2X and (X represents target  concentration) based on a 10 L air sample are injected into several  tubes at each level. Dilutions of benzene with carbon disulfide are made  to allow injection of measurable quantities. These tubes are then  allowed to equilibrate at least overnight. Following equilibration they  are analyzed following the same procedure as the samples. Desorption  efficiency is determined by dividing the amount of benzene found by  amount spiked on the tube.</p><p class="depth0">6. Calibration and standards. A series of standards varying in  concentration over the range of interest is prepared and analyzed under  the same GC conditions that will be used on the samples.
