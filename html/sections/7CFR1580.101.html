L. 107-210), and re-authorized and modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5). The regulations establish procedures by which a group of producers of raw agricultural commodities or fishermen (jointly referred to as ``producers'') can petition for certification of eligibility and through which individual producers covered by a certified petition can apply for technical assistance and cash benefits for the development and implementation of approved business adjustment plans.</p>
