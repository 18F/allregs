Where applicable the statement set forth in DAR 1-506 will be  included in Invitation for Bids and Contracts of Sale and an identical  signed statement will be secured from the prospective purchaser where  the property is to be sold without advertising for competitive bids. In  addition to the statement, Standard Form 119 (Contractor's Statement of  Contingent or Other Fees for Soliciting or Securing, or Resulting From  Award of Contract) will be completed where either part of the statement  is answered in the affirmative. The exceptions to the use of the  statement and Standard Form 119 are set forth in DAR 1-506-3 and may  apply generally to real property sales of the Army, Air Force and non- defense agencies except that the monetary limitation prescribed by DAR  1-506.3 is $1,000 insofar as sales or property of the Department of  Energy are concerned.</p>
