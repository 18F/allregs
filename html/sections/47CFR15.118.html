                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All consumer electronics TV receiving equipment marketed in the  United States as cable ready or cable compatible shall comply with the  provisions of this section. Consumer electronics TV receiving equipment  that includes features intended for use with cable service but does not  fully comply with the provisions of this section are subject to the  labelling requirements of Sec. 15.19(d). Until such time as generally  accepted testing standards are developed, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section will apply only to the analog portion of covered consumer  electronics TV receiving equipment</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cable ready consumer electronics equipment shall be capable of  receiving all NTSC or similar video channels on channels 1 through 125  of the channel allocation plan set forth in CEA-542-B: ``CEA Standard:  Cable Television Channel Identification Plan,'' (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 15.38).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cable ready consumer electronics equipment must meet the  following technical performance requirements. Compliance with these  requirements shall be determined by performing measurements at the  unfiltered IF output port. Where appropriate, the Commission will  consider allowing alternative measurement methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjacent channel interference. In the presence of a lower  adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual  carrier in frequency and 10 dB below the desired visual carrier in  amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated  at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The  desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10  IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier which is 10 dB  below the visual carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be  performed for input signal levels of 0 dBmV and + 15 dBmV, with the  receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the  band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Image channel interference. Image channel interference within  the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the  desired channel by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 714 MHz and 50 dB from  714 MHz to 804 MHz. The 60 dB standard applies at 714 MHz. In testing  for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be an  NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat  field with color burst and the aural carrier is unmodulated and 10 dB  below the visual carrier. The undesired test signal shall be a CW signal  equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz  above the visual carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements  shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and + 15 dBmV, with the  receiver tuned to at least ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels  covering the band 54 MHz to 804 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direct pickup interference. The direct pickup (DPU) of a co- channel interfering ambient field by a cable ready device shall not  exceed the following criteria. The ratio of the desired to undesired  signal levels at the IF passband on each channel shall be at least 45  dB. The average ratio over the six channels shall be at least 50 dB. The  desired input signal shall be an NTSC signal having a visual carrier  level of 0 dBmV. The visual carrier is modulated with a 10 IRE flat  field with color burst, visual to aural carrier ratio of 10 dB, aural  carrier unmodulated. The equipment under test (EUT) shall be   placed on a rotatable table that is one meter in height. Any excess  length of the power cord and other connecting leads shall be coiled on  the floor under the table. The EUT shall be immersed in a horizontally  polarized uniform CW field of 100 mV/m at a frequency 2.55 MHz above the  visual carrier of the EUT tuned channel. Measurements shall be made with  the EUT tuned to six EIA IS-132 channels, two each in the low VHF, high  VHF and UHF broadcast bands. On each channel, the levels at the IF  passband due to the desired and interfering signals are to be measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tuner overload. Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be  attenuated at least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired  channel using a comb-like spectrum input with each visual carrier signal  individually set at + 15 dBmV from 54 to 550 MHz. The desired input  signal is to be an NTSC signal on which the visual carrier is modulated  with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst and the aural carrier is  unmodulated and 10 dB below the visual carrier. Measurements shall be  made with the receiver tuned to at least seven evenly spaced EIA IS-132  channels covering the band 54 MHz to 550 MHz. In addition, spurious  signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 51 dB below  the visual carrier of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input  with each signal individually set at + 15 dBmV from 550 to 804 MHz.  Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least three  evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels covering the band 550 MHz to 804 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cable input conducted emissions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conducted spurious  emissions that appear at the cable input to the device must meet the  following criteria. The input shall be an NTSC video carrier modulated  with a 10 IRE flat field with color burst at a level of 0 dBmV and with  a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The aural carrier shall be  unmodulated. The peak level of the spurious signals will be measured  using a spectrum analyzer connected by a directional coupler to the  cable input of the equipment under test. Spurious signal levels must not  exceed the limits in the following table:  From 54 MHz up to and including 300 MHz-26 dBmV From 300 MHz up to and including 450 MHz-20 dBmV From 450 MHz up to and including 804 MHz-15 dBmV</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The average of the measurements on multiple channels from 450  MHz up to and including 804 MHz shall be no greater than -20 dBmV.  Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least four EIA  IS-132 channels in each of the above bands. The test channels are to be  evenly distributed across each of the bands. Measurements for conducted  emissions caused by sources internal to the device are to be made in a  shielded room. Measurements for conducted emissions caused by external  signal sources shall be made in an ambient RF field whose field strength  is 100 mV/m, following the same test conditions as described in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The field strength of radiated emissions from cable ready  consumer electronics equipment shall not exceed the limits in  Sec. 15.109(a) when measured in accordance with the applicable  procedures specified in Secs. 15.31 and 15.35 for unintentional  radiators, with the following modifications. During testing the NTSC  input signal level is to be + 15 dBmV, with a visual to aural ratio of  10 dB. The visual carrier is to be modulated by a 10 IRE flat field with  color burst; the aural carrier is to be unmodulated. Measurements are to  be taken on six EIA IS-132 channels evenly spaced across the required RF  input range of the equipment under test.
