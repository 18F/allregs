                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Organizational-level maintenance (or basic-level maintenance) is  the first level of maintenance that can be performed ``on-equipment''  (directly on the defense article or support equipment) without  specialized training. It consists of repairing, inspecting, servicing,  calibrating, lubricating, or adjusting equipment, as well as replacing  minor parts, components, assemblies, and line-replaceable spares or  units. This includes modifications, enhancements, or upgrades that would  result in improving only the reliability or maintainability of the  commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between failure (MTBF)) and does  not enhance the basic performance or capability of the defense article.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intermediate-level maintenance is second-level maintenance  performed   ``off-equipment'' (on removed parts, components, or equipment) at or by  designated maintenance shops or centers, tenders, or field teams. It may  consist of calibrating, repairing, testing, or replacing damaged or  unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies. This includes  modifications, enhancements, or upgrades that would result in improving  only the reliability or maintainability of the commodity (e.g., an  increased mean time between failure (MTBF)) and does not enhance the  basic performance or capability of the defense article.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Depot-level maintenance is third-level maintenance performed on-  or off-equipment at or by a major repair facility, shipyard, or field  team, each with necessary equipment and personnel of requisite technical  skill. It consists of providing evaluation or repair beyond unit or  organization capability. This maintenance consists of inspecting,  testing, calibrating, repairing, overhauling, refurbishing,  reconditioning, and one-to-one replacing of any defective parts,  components or assemblies. This includes modifications, enhancements, or  upgrades that would result in improving only the reliability or  maintainability of the commodity (e.g., an increased mean time between  failure (MTBF)) and does not enhance the basic performance or capability  of the defense article.
