For purposes of this subpart, evidence of exportation and satisfactory evidence of payment of duties in Canada or Mexico shall consist of one of the following types of documentation, provided that, for purposes of evidence of duties paid, such documentation includes the import entry number, the date of importation, the tariff classification number, the rate of duty and the amount of duties paid:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of Canada, the Canadian entry document, referred to as the Canada Customs Invoice or B-3, presented with either the K-84 Statement or the Detailed Coding Statement.
