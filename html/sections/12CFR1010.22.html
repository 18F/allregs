                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial Statement of Record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except in the case of exempt  transactions, an initial Statement of Record shall be filed, and an  effective date issued, prior to selling or leasing any lot in a  subdivision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a developer buys from another developer 100 or more lots from  an existing registration, the new developer, or owner, may have to  submit a new initial Statement of Record and receive an effective date  covering the acquired lots prior to selling or leasing any of those  lots.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changes in principals due to a sale of stock in a corporation or  changes in partners or joint venturers which are accomplished in  accordance with the partnership or joint venture agreement but which do  not cause a change in the title to the land in the subdivision may be  submitted as an amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any initial Statement of Record must be accompanied by a fee, as  specified in Sec. 1010.35(b), based upon the number of lots sought to be  registered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consolidated Statement of Record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the developer intends  to sell or lease additional lots as part of the same common promotional  plan with lots already registered, a consolidated Statement of Record  may be submitted for the additional lots. A fee, as specified in  Sec. 1010.35(b) and based on the number of additional lots, must  accompany the submission. The additional lots may not be sold or leased  until a new effective date is issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the additional lots are simply the result of a replatting of  lots previously registered and enumerated in the Property Report and do  not include any additional land, the change may be made by an amendment.  However, the amendment must be accompanied by a fee, as specified in  Sec. 1010.35(b), based on the number of additional lots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through  (4) of this section. Pages having no changes and documents in previous  submissions which apply equally to the additional   lots may be included by reference. However, the developer may, at its  option, submit the entire format for an initial filing, including copies  of previously submitted documents, to expedite the examination process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those pages of the Property Report portion and Additional  Information and Documentation portion which contain changes which have  occurred since the last effective submission, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A recapitulation or listing of each of the section headings, and  subheadings if necessary, of the Additional Information and  Documentation portion. Each item of the listing shall contain a  statement as to whether or not any change is made in the section;  whether any new or additional information is being submitted and, if  documentation is added by cross reference, the previous submission in  which that documentation may be found, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentation to support the additional lots (e.g., plat maps,  topographic maps and general plan to reflect new lots, title  information, permits for additional facilities, financial assurances of  completion of additional facilities, financial statements) or updated or  expanded documents in support of previous submissions, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The affirmation required by Sec. 1010.219.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consolidated Statement of Record amends prior Statement of  Record. A Consolidated Statement of Record shall contain all applicable  information for all registered lots in the subdivision except those  deleted pursuant to other provisions in these regulations. The resulting  Property Report shall be used for all sales in the subdivision, except  for those transactions which are exempt from the provisions of the Act  or which have been granted an exempt status by the Director, unless the  Director has specifically authorized the use of multiple Property  Reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Initial Statement of Record--when prior approval to submit is  required. In those subdivisions where there is a disparity between the  lots already registered and those sought to be registered because of  location, terrain, proposed use of the lots or the amenities to be  furnished or available, the developer may present a resume of the  differences and request the Director's permission to file a separate  initial Statement of Record for the additional lots. Upon consideration  of the facts submitted, the Director may allow such a procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lots which have been deleted from registration. Should the  developer, for any reason, delete by amendment any registered lots from  an effective Statement of Record, those lots must be reregistered by a  consolidation and a new effective date issued, before they can be sold  or leased. An appropriate fee must accompany the submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Lots sold to individual purchasers. It is not necessary to  delete from the registration those lots which have been sold to  individual purchasers for their own use.</p>
