In summary, in order to have your shareholder proposal  included on a company's proxy card, and included along with any  supporting statement in its proxy statement, you must be eligible and  follow certain procedures. Under a few specific circumstances, the  company is permitted to exclude your proposal, but only after submitting  its reasons to the Commission. We structured this section in a question- and-answer format so that it is easier to understand. The references to  ``you'' are to a shareholder seeking to submit the proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Question 1: What is a proposal? A shareholder proposal is your  recommendation or requirement that the company and/or its board of  directors take action, which you intend to present at a meeting of the  company's shareholders. Your proposal should state as clearly as  possible the course of action that you believe the company should  follow. If your proposal is placed on the company's proxy card, the  company must also provide in the form of proxy means for shareholders to  specify by boxes a choice between approval or disapproval, or  abstention. Unless otherwise indicated, the word ``proposal'' as used in  this section refers both to your proposal, and to your corresponding  statement in support of your proposal (if any).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Question 2: Who is eligible to submit a proposal, and how do I  demonstrate to the company that I am eligible? (1) In order to be  eligible to submit a proposal, you must have continuously held at least  $2,000 in market value, or 1%, of the company's securities entitled to  be voted on the proposal at the meeting for at least one year by the  date you submit the proposal. You must continue to hold those securities  through the date of the meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you are the registered holder of your securities, which means  that your name appears in the company's records as a shareholder, the  company can verify your eligibility on its own, although you will still  have to provide the company with a written statement that you intend to  continue to hold the securities through the date of the meeting of  shareholders. However, if like many shareholders you are not a  registered holder, the company likely does not know that you are a  shareholder, or how many shares you own. In this case, at the time you  submit your proposal, you must prove your eligibility to the company in  one of two ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The first way is to submit to the company a written statement  from the ``record'' holder of your securities (usually a broker or bank)  verifying that, at the time you submitted your proposal, you  continuously held the securities for at least one year. You must also  include your own written statement that you intend to continue to hold  the securities through the date of the meeting of shareholders; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The second way to prove ownership applies only if you have  filed a Schedule 13D (Sec. 240.13d-101), Schedule 13G (Sec. 240.13d- 102), Form 3 (Sec. 249.103 of this chapter), Form 4 (Sec. 249.104 of  this chapter) and/or Form 5 (Sec. 249.105 of this chapter), or  amendments to those documents or updated forms, reflecting your  ownership of the shares as of or before the date on which the one-year  eligibility period begins. If you have filed one of these documents with  the SEC, you may demonstrate your eligibility by submitting to the  company:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A copy of the schedule and/or form, and any subsequent  amendments reporting a change in your ownership level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Your written statement that you continuously held the required  number of shares for the one-year period as of the date of the  statement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Your written statement that you intend to continue ownership of  the shares through the date of the company's annual or special meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Question 3: How many proposals may I submit? Each shareholder  may submit no more than one proposal to a company for a particular  shareholders' meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Question 4: How long can my proposal be? The proposal, including  any accompanying supporting statement, may not exceed 500 words.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Question 5: What is the deadline for submitting a proposal? (1)  If you are submitting your proposal for the company's annual meeting,  you can in most cases find the deadline in last year's proxy statement.  However, if the company did not hold an annual meeting last year, or has  changed the date of its meeting for this year more than 30 days from  last year's meeting, you can usually find the deadline in one of the  company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (Sec. 249.308a of this  chapter), or in shareholder reports of investment companies under  Sec. 270.30d-1 of this chapter of the Investment Company Act of 1940. In  order to avoid controversy, shareholders should submit their proposals  by means, including electronic means, that permit them to prove the date  of delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The deadline is calculated in the following manner if the  proposal is submitted for a regularly scheduled annual meeting. The  proposal must be received at the company's principal executive offices  not less than 120 calendar days before the date of the company's proxy  statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous  year's annual meeting. However, if the company did not hold an annual  meeting the previous year, or if the date of this year's annual meeting  has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous  year's meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the  company begins to print and send its proxy materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you are submitting your proposal for a meeting of  shareholders other than a regularly scheduled annual meeting, the  deadline is a reasonable time before the company begins to print and  send its proxy materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Question 6: What if I fail to follow one of the eligibility or  procedural requirements explained in answers to Questions 1 through 4 of  this section? (1) The company may exclude your proposal, but only after  it has notified you of the problem, and you have failed adequately to  correct it. Within 14 calendar days of receiving your proposal, the  company must notify you in writing of any procedural or eligibility  deficiencies, as well as of the time frame for your response. Your  response must be postmarked, or transmitted electronically, no later  than 14 days from the date you received the company's notification. A  company need not provide you such notice of a deficiency if the  deficiency cannot be remedied, such as if you fail to submit a proposal  by the company's properly determined deadline. If the company intends to  exclude the proposal, it will later have to make a submission under  Sec. 240.14a-8 and provide you with a copy under Question 10 below,  Sec. 240.14a-8(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you fail in your promise to hold the required number of  securities through the date of the meeting of shareholders, then the  company will be permitted to exclude all of your proposals from its  proxy materials for any meeting held in the following two calendar  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Question 7: Who has the burden of persuading the Commission or  its staff that my proposal can be excluded? Except as otherwise noted,  the burden is on the company to demonstrate that it is entitled to  exclude a proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Question 8: Must I appear personally at the shareholders'  meeting to present the proposal? (1) Either you, or your representative  who is qualified under state law to present the proposal on your behalf,  must attend the meeting to present the proposal. Whether you attend the  meeting yourself or send a qualified representative to the meeting in  your place, you should make sure that you, or your representative,  follow the proper state law procedures for attending the meeting and/or  presenting your proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the company holds its shareholder meeting in whole or in part  via electronic media, and the company permits you or your representative  to present your proposal via such media,   then you may appear through electronic media rather than traveling to  the meeting to appear in person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you or your qualified representative fail to appear and  present the proposal, without good cause, the company will be permitted  to exclude all of your proposals from its proxy materials for any  meetings held in the following two calendar years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Question 9: If I have complied with the procedural requirements,  on what other bases may a company rely to exclude my proposal? (1)  Improper under state law: If the proposal is not a proper subject for  action by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the  company's organization;</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (i)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Depending on the subject matter, some proposals are not considered  proper under state law if they would be binding on the company if  approved by shareholders. In our experience, most proposals that are  cast as recommendations or requests that the board of directors take  specified action are proper under state law. Accordingly, we will assume  that a proposal drafted as a recommendation or suggestion is proper  unless the company demonstrates otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Violation of law: If the proposal would, if implemented, cause  the company to violate any state, federal, or foreign law to which it is  subject;</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (i)(2):</p><p class="depth0">We will not apply this basis for exclusion to permit exclusion of a  proposal on grounds that it would violate foreign law if compliance with  the foreign law would result in a violation of any state or federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Violation of proxy rules: If the proposal or supporting  statement is contrary to any of the Commission's proxy rules, including  Sec. 240.14a-9, which prohibits materially false or misleading  statements in proxy soliciting materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Personal grievance; special interest: If the proposal relates to  the redress of a personal claim or grievance against the company or any  other person, or if it is designed to result in a benefit to you, or to  further a personal interest, which is not shared by the other  shareholders at large;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Relevance: If the proposal relates to operations which account  for less than 5 percent of the company's total assets at the end of its  most recent fiscal year, and for less than 5 percent of its net earnings  and gross sales for its most recent fiscal year, and is not otherwise  significantly related to the company's business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Absence of power/authority: If the company would lack the power  or authority to implement the proposal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Management functions: If the proposal deals with a matter  relating to the company's ordinary business operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Director elections: If the proposal:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Would disqualify a nominee who is standing for election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Would remove a director from office before his or her term  expired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Questions the competence, business judgment, or character of  one or more nominees or directors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Seeks to include a specific individual in the company's proxy  materials for election to the board of directors; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Otherwise could affect the outcome of the upcoming election of  directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Conflicts with company's proposal: If the proposal directly  conflicts with one of the company's own proposals to be submitted to  shareholders at the same meeting;</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (i)(9):</p><p class="depth0">A company's submission to the Commission under this section should  specify the points of conflict with the company's proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Substantially implemented: If the company has already  substantially implemented the proposal;</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (i)(10):</p><p class="depth0">A company may exclude a shareholder proposal that would provide an  advisory vote or seek future advisory votes to approve the compensation  of executives as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K  (Sec. 229.402 of this chapter) or any successor to Item 402 (a ``say-on- pay vote'') or that relates to the frequency of say-on-pay votes,  provided that in the most recent shareholder vote required by  Sec. 240.14a-21(b) of this chapter a single year (i.e., one, two, or  three years) received approval of a majority of votes cast on the matter  and the company has adopted a policy on the frequency of say-on-pay  votes that is consistent with the choice of the majority of votes cast  in the most recent shareholder vote required by Sec. 240.14a-21(b) of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Duplication: If the proposal substantially duplicates another  proposal   previously submitted to the company by another proponent that will be  included in the company's proxy materials for the same meeting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Resubmissions: If the proposal deals with substantially the  same subject matter as another proposal or proposals that has or have  been previously included in the company's proxy materials within the  preceding 5 calendar years, a company may exclude it from its proxy  materials for any meeting held within 3 calendar years of the last time  it was included if the proposal received:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Less than 3% of the vote if proposed once within the preceding 5  calendar years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Less than 6% of the vote on its last submission to shareholders  if proposed twice previously within the preceding 5 calendar years;

(1) If the company intends to exclude a  proposal from its proxy materials, it must file its reasons with the  Commission no later than 80 calendar days before it files its definitive  proxy statement and form of proxy with the Commission. The company must  simultaneously provide you with a copy of its submission. The Commission  staff may permit the company to make its submission later than 80 days  before the company files its definitive proxy statement and form of  proxy, if the company demonstrates good cause for missing the deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The company must file six paper copies of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The proposal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of why the company believes that it may exclude  the proposal, which should, if possible, refer to the most recent  applicable authority, such as prior Division letters issued under the  rule; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A supporting opinion of counsel when such reasons are based on  matters of state or foreign law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Question 11: May I submit my own statement to the Commission  responding to the company's arguments?</p><p class="depth0">Yes, you may submit a response, but it is not required. You should  try to submit any response to us, with a copy to the company, as soon as  possible after the company makes its submission. This way, the  Commission staff will have time to consider fully your submission before  it issues its response. You should submit six paper copies of your  response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Question 12: If the company includes my shareholder proposal in  its proxy materials, what information about me must it include along  with the proposal itself?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The company's proxy statement must include your name and  address, as well as the number of the company's voting securities that  you hold. However, instead of providing that information, the company  may instead include a statement that it will provide the information to  shareholders promptly upon receiving an oral or written request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The company is not responsible for the contents of your proposal  or supporting statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Question 13: What can I do if the company includes in its proxy  statement reasons why it believes shareholders should not vote in favor  of my proposal, and I disagree with some of its statements?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The company may elect to include in its proxy statement reasons  why it believes shareholders should vote against your proposal. The  company is allowed to make arguments reflecting its own point of view,  just as you may express your own point of view in your proposal's  supporting statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> However, if you believe that the company's opposition to your  proposal contains materially false or misleading statements that may  violate our anti-fraud rule, Sec. 240.14a-9, you should promptly send to  the Commission staff and the company a letter explaining the reasons for  your view, along with a copy of the company's statements opposing your  proposal. To the extent possible, your letter should include specific  factual information demonstrating the inaccuracy of the company's  claims. Time permitting, you   may wish to try to work out your differences with the company by  yourself before contacting the Commission staff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We require the company to send you a copy of its statements  opposing your proposal before it sends its proxy materials, so that you  may bring to our attention any materially false or misleading  statements, under the following timeframes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If our no-action response requires that you make revisions to  your proposal or supporting statement as a condition to requiring the  company to include it in its proxy materials, then the company must  provide you with a copy of its opposition statements no later than 5  calendar days after the company receives a copy of your revised  proposal; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, the company must provide you with a copy of  its opposition statements no later than 30 calendar days before its  files definitive copies of its proxy statement and form of proxy under  Sec. 240.14a-6.

The filing person may incorporate by reference financial  statements contained in any document filed with the Commission, solely  for the purposes of this schedule, if: (a) The financial statements  substantially meet the requirements of this item; (b) an express  statement is made that the financial statements are incorporated by  reference; (c) the information incorporated by reference is clearly  identified by page, paragraph, caption or otherwise; and (d) if the  information incorporated by reference is not filed with this schedule,  an indication is made where the information may be inspected and copies  obtained. Financial statements that are required to be presented in  comparative form for two or more fiscal years or periods may not be  incorporated by reference unless the material incorporated by reference  includes the entire period for which the comparative data is required to  be given. See General Instruction F to this schedule.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the offeror in a third-party tender offer is a natural person,  and such person's financial information is material, disclose the net  worth of the offeror. If the offeror's net worth is derived from  material amounts of assets that are not readily marketable or there are  material guarantees and contingencies, disclose the nature and  approximate amount of the individual's net worth that consists of  illiquid assets and the magnitude of any guarantees or contingencies  that may negatively affect the natural person's net worth.</p><p class="depth0">5. Pro forma financial information is required in a negotiated  third-party cash tender offer when securities are intended to be offered  in a subsequent merger or other transaction in which remaining target  securities are acquired and the acquisition of the subject company is  significant to the offeror under Sec. 210.11-01(b)(1) of this chapter.  The offeror must disclose the financial information specified in Item  3(f) and Item 5 of Form S-4 (Sec. 239.25 of this chapter) in the  schedule filed with the Commission, but may furnish only the summary  financial information specified in Item 3(d), (e) and (f) of Form S-4 in  the disclosure document sent to security holders. If pro forma financial  information is required by this instruction, the historical financial  statements specified in Item 1010 of Regulation M-A (Sec. 229.1010 of  this chapter) are required for the bidder.</p><p class="depth0">6. The disclosure materials disseminated to security holders may  contain the summarized financial information specified by Item 1010(c)  of Regulation M-A (Sec. 229.1010 of this chapter) instead of the  financial information required by Item 1010(a) and (b). In that case,  the financial information required by Item 1010(a) and (b) of Regulation  M-A must be   disclosed in the statement. If summarized financial information is  disseminated to security holders, include appropriate instructions on  how more complete financial information can be obtained. If the  summarized financial information is prepared on the basis of a  comprehensive body of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP, the  summarized financial information must be accompanied by a reconciliation  as described in Instruction 8 of this Item.</p><p class="depth0">7. If the offeror is not subject to the periodic reporting  requirements of the Act, the financial statements required by this Item  need not be audited if audited financial statements are not available or  obtainable without unreasonable cost or expense. Make a statement to  that effect and the reasons for their unavailability.</p><p class="depth0">8. If the financial statements required by this Item are prepared on  the basis of a comprehensive body of accounting principles other than  U.S. GAAP, provide a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in accordance with Item  17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter), unless a reconciliation  is unavailable or not obtainable without unreasonable cost or expense.  At a minimum, however, when financial statements are prepared on a basis  other than U.S. GAAP, a narrative description of all material variations  in accounting principles, practices and methods used in preparing the  non-U.S. GAAP financial statements from those accepted in the U.S. must  be presented.</p><p class="depth0">Item 11.

The risk factors must address, at a minimum, the following major risk  categories: interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate  risk, and commodity price risk. For material exposures in the major  currencies and markets, modeling techniques must capture, at a minimum,  spread risk and must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve to  capture differences in volatility and less-than-perfect correlation of  rates along the yield curve. An OTC derivatives dealer must provide the  Commission with evidence that the OTC derivatives dealer's VAR model  takes account of specific risk in positions, including specific equity  risk, if the OTC derivatives dealer intends to utilize its VAR model to  compute capital charges for equity price risk.

The content of the Schedule is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">[next page]</p><p class="depth0">Important Information on Penny Stocks</p><p class="depth0">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires your  broker to give this statement to you, and to obtain your signature to  show that you have received it, before your first trade in a penny  stock. This statement contains important information--and you should  read it carefully before you sign it, and before you decide to purchase  or sell a penny stock.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to obtaining your signature, the SEC requires your  broker to wait at least two business days after sending you this  statement before executing your first trade to give you time to  carefully consider your trade.</p><p class="depth0">Penny Stocks Can Be Very Risky</p><p class="depth0">Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies. Penny stocks  may trade infrequently--which means that it may be difficult to sell  penny stock shares once you have them. Because it may also be difficult  to find quotations for penny stocks, they may be impossible to  accurately price. Investors in   penny stock should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose  their whole investment.</p><p class="depth0">While penny stocks generally trade over-the-counter, they may also  trade on U.S. securities exchanges, facilities of U.S. exchanges, or  foreign exchanges. You should learn about the market in which the penny  stock trades to determine how much demand there is for this stock and  how difficult it will be to sell. Be especially careful if your broker  is offering to sell you newly issued penny stock that has no established  trading market.</p><p class="depth0">The securities you are considering have not been approved or  disapproved by the SEC. Moreover, the SEC has not passed upon the  fairness or the merits of this transaction nor upon the accuracy or  adequacy of the information contained in any prospectus or any other  information provided by an issuer or a broker or dealer.</p><p class="depth0">Information You Should Get</p><p class="depth0">In addition to this statement, your broker is required to give you a  statement of your financial situation and investment goals explaining  why his or her firm has determined that penny stocks are a suitable  investment for you. In addition, your broker is required to obtain your  agreement to the proposed penny stock transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Before you buy penny stock, Federal law requires your salesperson to  tell you the ``offer'' and the ``bid'' on the stock, and the  ``compensation'' the salesperson and the firm receive for the trade. The  firm also must send a confirmation of these prices to you after the  trade. You will need this price information to determine what profit or  loss, if any, you will have when you sell your stock.</p><p class="depth0">The offer price is the wholesale price at which the dealer is  willing to sell stock to other dealers. The bid price is the wholesale  price at which the dealer is willing to buy the stock from other  dealers. In its trade with you, the dealer may add a retail charge to  these wholesale prices as compensation (called a ``markup'' or  ``markdown'').</p><p class="depth0">The difference between the bid and the offer price is the dealer's  ``spread.'' A spread that is large compared with the purchase price can  make a resale of a stock very costly. To be profitable when you sell,  the bid price of your stock must rise above the amount of this spread  and the compensation charged by both your selling and purchasing  dealers. Remember that if the dealer has no bid price, you may not be  able to sell the stock after you buy it, and may lose your whole  investment.</p><p class="depth0">After you buy penny stock, your brokerage firm must send you a  monthly account statement that gives an estimate of the value of each  penny stock in your account, if there is enough information to make an  estimate.

These rules  describe the whistleblower program that the Commission has established  to implement the provisions of Section 21F, and explain the procedures  you will need to follow in order to be eligible for an award. You should  read these procedures carefully because the failure to take certain  required steps within the time frames described in these rules may  disqualify you from receiving an award for which you otherwise may be  eligible. Unless expressly provided for in these rules, no person is  authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind the  Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount  thereof. The Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of the  Whistleblower administers our whistleblower program. Questions about the  program or these rules should be directed to the SEC Office of the  Whistleblower, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-5631.

The Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from the  authority bringing the related action in making this determination.

The amount  will be at least 10 percent and no more than 30 percent of the monetary  sanctions that the Commission and the other authorities are able to  collect.

In determining whether to increase the amount of an award, the  Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in  order of importance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Significance of the information provided by the whistleblower.  The Commission will assess the significance of the information provided  by a whistleblower to the success of the Commission action or related  action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into  account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the information provided by the whistleblower and  how it related to the successful enforcement action, including whether  the reliability and completeness of the information provided to the  Commission by the whistleblower resulted in the conservation of  Commission resources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The degree to which the information provided by the  whistleblower supported one or more successful claims brought in the  Commission or related action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assistance provided by the whistleblower. The Commission will  assess the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any  legal representative of the whistleblower in the Commission action or  related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into  account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the whistleblower provided ongoing, extensive, and  timely cooperation and assistance by, for example, helping to explain  complex transactions, interpreting key evidence, or identifying new and  productive lines of inquiry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The timeliness of the whistleblower's initial report to the  Commission or to an internal compliance or reporting system of business  organizations committing, or impacted by, the securities violations,  where appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The resources conserved as a result of the whistleblower's  assistance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the whistleblower appropriately encouraged or  authorized others to assist the staff of the Commission who might  otherwise not have participated in the investigation or related action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The efforts undertaken by the whistleblower to remediate the  harm caused by the violations, including assisting the authorities in  the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any unique hardships experienced by the whistleblower as a  result of his or her reporting and assisting in the enforcement action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Law enforcement interest. The Commission will assess its  programmatic interest in deterring violations of the securities laws by  making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to  the successful enforcement of such laws. In considering   this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The degree to which an award enhances the Commission's ability  to enforce the Federal securities laws and protect investors; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The degree to which an award encourages the submission of high  quality information from whistleblowers by appropriately rewarding  whistleblowers' submission of significant information and assistance,  even in cases where the monetary sanctions available for collection are  limited or potential monetary sanctions were reduced or eliminated by  the Commission because an entity self-reported a securities violation  following the whistleblower's related internal disclosure, report, or  submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the subject matter of the action is a Commission  priority, whether the reported misconduct involves regulated entities or  fiduciaries, whether the whistleblower exposed an industry-wide  practice, the type and severity of the securities violations, the age  and duration of misconduct, the number of violations, and the isolated,  repetitive, or ongoing nature of the violations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The dangers to investors or others presented by the underlying  violations involved in the enforcement action, including the amount of  harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations, the type of  harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations, and the  number of individuals or entities harmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Participation in internal compliance systems. The Commission  will assess whether, and the extent to which, the whistleblower and any  legal representative of the whistleblower participated in internal  compliance systems. In considering this factor, the Commission may take  into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower reported the  possible securities violations through internal whistleblower, legal or  compliance procedures before, or at the same time as, reporting them to  the Commission; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower assisted any  internal investigation or inquiry concerning the reported securities  violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Factors that may decrease the amount of a whistleblower's award.  In determining whether to decrease the amount of an award, the  Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in  order of importance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Culpability. The Commission will assess the culpability or  involvement of the whistleblower in matters associated with the  Commission's action or related actions. In considering this factor, the  Commission may take into account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The whistleblower's role in the securities violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The whistleblower's education, training, experience, and  position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the whistleblower acted with scienter, both generally  and in relation to others who participated in the violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the whistleblower financially benefitted from the  violations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whether the whistleblower is a recidivist;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The egregiousness of the underlying fraud committed by the  whistleblower; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Whether the whistleblower knowingly interfered with the  Commission's investigation of the violations or related enforcement  actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unreasonable reporting delay. The Commission will assess whether  the whistleblower unreasonably delayed reporting the securities  violations. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into  account, among other things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but  failed to take reasonable steps to report or prevent the violations from  occurring or continuing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but  only reported them after learning about a related inquiry,  investigation, or enforcement action; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether there was a legitimate reason for the whistleblower to  delay reporting the violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interference with internal compliance and reporting systems. The  Commission will assess, in cases where the whistleblower interacted with  his or   her entity's internal compliance or reporting system, whether the  whistleblower undermined the integrity of such system. In considering  this factor, the Commission will take into account whether there is  evidence provided to the Commission that the whistleblower knowingly:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interfered with an entity's established legal, compliance, or  audit procedures to prevent or delay detection of the reported  securities violation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Made any material false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements  or representations that hindered an entity's efforts to detect,  investigate, or remediate the reported securities violations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provided any false writing or document knowing the writing or  document contained any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or  entries that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or  remediate the reported securities violations.

Each of these entities other than foreign  securities and law enforcement authorities is subject to the  confidentiality requirements set forth in Section 21F(h) of the Exchange  Act (15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)). The Commission will determine what assurances  of confidentiality it deems appropriate in providing such information to  foreign securities and law enforcement authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may make disclosures in accordance with the  Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You may submit information to the Commission anonymously.

Sec. 240.21F-16  Awards to whistleblowers who engage in culpable conduct.</p><p class="depth0">In determining whether the required $1,000,000 threshold has been  satisfied (this threshold is further explained in Sec. 240.21F-10 of  this chapter) for purposes of making any award, the Commission will not  take into account any monetary sanctions that the whistleblower is  ordered to pay, or that are ordered against any entity whose liability  is based substantially on conduct that the whistleblower directed,  planned, or initiated. Similarly, if the Commission determines that a  whistleblower is eligible for an award, any amounts that the  whistleblower or such an entity pay in sanctions as a result of the  action or related actions will not be included within the calculation of  the amounts collected for purposes of making payments.    Sec. 240.21F-17  Staff communications with individuals reporting  possible securities law violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No person may take any action to impede an individual from  communicating directly with the Commission staff about a possible  securities law violation, including enforcing, or threatening to  enforce, a confidentiality agreement (other than agreements dealing with  information covered by Sec. 240.21F-4(b)(4)(i) and Sec. 240.21F- 4(b)(4)(ii) of this chapter related to the legal representation of a  client) with respect to such communications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If you are a director, officer, member, agent, or employee of an  entity that has counsel, and you have initiated communication with the  Commission relating to a possible securities law violation, the staff is  authorized to communicate directly with you regarding the possible  securities law violation without seeking the consent of the entity's  counsel.</p><p class="depth0">Inspection and Publication of Information Filed Under the Act    Sec. 240.24b-1  Documents to be kept public by exchanges.</p><p class="depth0">Upon action of the Commission granting an exchange's application for  registration or exemption, the exchange shall make available to public  inspection at its offices during reasonable office hours a copy of the  statement and exhibits filed with the Commission (including any  amendments thereto) except those portions thereof to the disclosure of  which the exchange shall have filed objection pursuant to Sec. 240.24b-2  which objection shall not have been overruled by the Commission pursuant  to section 24(b) of the Act.
