                                Sec. 13.952  May a snowmachine be used in that portion of the park
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">No, based on the application of the definition of traditional  activities within the park to the factual history of the Old Park, there  are no traditional activities that occurred during periods of adequate  snow cover within the Old Park; and, thus, Section 1110(a) of ANILCA  does not authorize snowmachine access. Hunting and trapping were not and  are not legally permitted activities in the Old Park at any time of the  year. Sport fishing has not taken place in the Old Park during periods  of adequate snow cover due to weather conditions that are adverse to  sport fishing, and the limited fishery resources within the Old Park.  During periods of adequate snow cover, berry picking is not feasible,  and has not taken place in the Old Park. Under the definition,  recreational use of snowmachines is not a traditional activity. There  are no villages, homesites or other valid occupancies within the Old  Park. Access by snowmachine through the Old Park in transit to  homesites, villages and other valid occupancies was not lawful prior to  the enactment of ANILCA and is available through routes outside the Old  Park that have been historically used for that purpose. Therefore, the  use of snowmachines is not authorized by section 1110(a) for such  travel. Further, Congress did not authorize subsistence activities in  the Old Park. In addition, the National Park Service has determined that  the use of even a few snowmachines in the Old Park would be detrimental  to the resource values of the area. Therefore, because no usage is  authorized in the Old Park by section 1110(a) the Old Park remains  closed to all snowmachine use in accordance with 36 CFR 2.18.</p>
