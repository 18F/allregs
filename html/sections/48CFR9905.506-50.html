                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The cost of an indirect function which exists for only a part of  a cost accounting period may be allocated on the basis of data for that  part of the cost accounting period if the cost is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material in amount,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accumulated in a separate indirect cost pool or expense pool,  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocated on the basis of an appropriate direct measure of the  activity or output of the function during that part of the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this Standard shall  include appropriate practices for deferrals, accruals, and other  adjustments to be used   in identifying the cost accounting periods among which any types of  expense and any types of adjustment to expense are distributed. If an  expense, such as insurance or employee leave, is identified with a  fixed, recurring, annual period which is different from the  institution's cost accounting period, the Standard permits continued use  of that different period. Such expenses shall be distributed to cost  accounting periods in accordance with the institution's established  practices for accruals, deferrals, and other adjustments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Indirect cost allocation rates, based on estimates, which are  used for the purpose of expediting the closing of contracts which are  terminated or completed prior to the end of a cost accounting period  need not be those finally determined or negotiated for that cost  accounting period. They shall, however, be developed to represent a full  cost accounting period, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this  subsection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An institution may, upon mutual agreement with the Government,  use as its cost accounting period a fixed annual period other than its  fiscal year, if the use of such a period is an established practice of  the institution and is consistently used for managing and controlling  revenues and disbursements, and appropriate accruals, deferrals or other  adjustments are made with respect to such annual periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contracting parties may agree to use an annual period which  does not coincide precisely with the cost accounting period for  developing the data used in establishing an allocation base: Provided,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The practice is necessary to obtain significant administrative  convenience,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The practice is consistently followed by the institution,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The annual period used is representative of the activity of the  cost accounting period for which the indirect costs to be allocated are  accumulated, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The practice can reasonably be estimated to provide a  distribution to cost objectives of the cost accounting period not  materially different from that which otherwise would be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a transitional cost accounting period is required under  the provisions of 9905.506-40(a)(3), the institution may select any one  of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The period, less than a year in length, extending from the end  of its previous cost accounting period to the beginning of its next  regular cost accounting period,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A period in excess of a year, but not longer than 15 months,  obtained by combining the period described in paragraph (f)(1) of this  subsection with the previous cost accounting period, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A period in excess of a year, but not longer than 15 months,  obtained by combining the period described in subparagraph (f)(1) of  this subsection with the next regular cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in the institution's cost accounting period is a change  in accounting practices for which an adjustment in the contract price  may be required in accordance with subdivision (a)(4)(ii) or (iii) of  the contract clause set out at 9903.201-4(e).</p>
