                                Sec. 115.307  Requirements for participation in the FHAP; Corrective
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies that participate in the FHAP must meet the requirements  enumerated in this section. The FHEO regional office shall review the  agency's compliance with the requirements of this section when it  conducts on-site performance assessments in accordance with Sec.  115.206. The requirements for participation in the FHAP are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency must conform to all reporting and record maintenance  requirements set forth in Sec. 115.308, as well as any additional  reporting and record maintenance requirements identified by the  Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must agree to on-site technical assistance and  guidance and implementation of corrective actions set out by the  Department in response to deficiencies found during the technical  assistance or performance assessment evaluations of the agency's  operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The agency must use the Department's official complaint data  information system and must input all relevant data and information into  the system in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The agency must agree to implement and adhere to policies and  procedures (as the agency's laws allow) provided to the agency by the  Assistant Secretary, including, but not limited   to, guidance on investigative techniques, case file preparation and  organization, and implementation of data elements for complaint  tracking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an agency that participates in the FHAP enforces  antidiscrimination laws other than a fair housing law (e.g.,  administration of a fair employment law), the agency must annually  provide a certification to HUD stating that it spends at least 20  percent of its total annual budget on fair housing activities. The term  ``total annual budget,'' as used in this subsection, means the entire  budget assigned by the jurisdiction to the agency for enforcing and  administering antidiscrimination laws, but does not include FHAP funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The agency may not co-mingle FHAP funds with other funds. FHAP  funds must be segregated from the agency's and the state or local  government's other funds and must be used for the purpose that HUD  provided the funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An agency may not unilaterally reduce the level of financial  resources currently committed to fair housing activities (budget and  staff reductions or other actions outside the control of the agency will  not, alone, result in a negative determination for the agency's  participation in the FHAP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The agency must comply with the provisions, certifications, and  assurances required in any and all written agreements executed by the  agency and the Department related to participation in the FHAP,  including, but not limited to, the cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The agency must draw down its funds in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The agency must be audited and receive copies of the audit  reports in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the state  and local government in which it is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The agency must participate in all required training, as  described in Sec. 115.306(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> If the agency subcontracts any activity for which the  subcontractor will receive FHAP funds, the agency must conform to the  subcontracting requirements of Sec. 115.309.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> If the agency receives a complaint that may implicate the First  Amendment of the United States Constitution, then the agency must  conform to the requirements of Sec. 115.310.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> If the agency utilizes FHAP funds to conduct fair housing  testing, then the agency must conform to the requirements of Sec.  115.311.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Corrective and remedial action for failing to comply with  requirements. The agency's refusal to provide information, assist in  implementation, or carry out the requirements of this section may result  in the denial or interruption of its receipt of FHAP funds. Prior to  denying or interrupting an agency's receipt of FHAP funds, HUD will put  the agency on notice of its intent to deny or interrupt. HUD will  identify its rationale for the denial or interruption and provide the  agency with an opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of  time. If, within the time period requested, the agency does not provide  information or documentation indicating that the requirement(s)  enumerated in this section is/are met, HUD may proceed with the denial  or interruption of FHAP funds. If, at any time following the denial or  interruption, HUD learns that the agency meets the requirements  enumerated in this section, HUD may opt to reinstate the agency's  receipt of FHAP funds.</p>
