                            <p class="depth0">Funds for the posting of bail or bond to secure the release of  personnel from confinement by foreign authorities before, during, or  after trial may be furnished in all criminal cases. Safeguards should be  imposed to assure that at the conclusion of the proceedings or on the  appearance of the defendant in court, the bail or bond will be refunded  to the military authorities. Bail will be provided only to guarantee the  presence of the defendant and will not be provided to guarantee the  payment of fines or civil damages. Local US military authorities are  expected to provide bail, in any case, only after other reasonable  efforts have been made to secure release of pretrial custody to the US.</p>
