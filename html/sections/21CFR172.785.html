                            <p class="depth0">The additive may be safely used as an antimicrobial agent specific  for Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) in accordance with the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The additive consists of a mixture of equal  proportions of six different individually purified lytic-type (lacking  lysogenic activity) bacteriophages (phages) specific against L.  monocytogenes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each phage is deposited at, and assigned an identifying code by,  a scientifically-recognized culture collection center, and is made  available to FDA upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The additive is produced from one or more cell cultures of L.  monocytogenes in a safe and suitable nutrient medium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The additive achieves a positive lytic  result (OD600 <=0.06) when tested against any of the  following L. monocytogenes isolates available from American Type Culture  Collection (ATCC): ATCC 35152 (serogroup 1/2a), ATCC 19118 (serogroup  4b), and ATCC 15313 (serogroup 1/2b). The analytical method for  determining the potency of the additive entitled ``Determination of  Potency of LMP-102\TM\,'' dated October 9, 2003, and printed by  Intralytix, Inc., is incorporated by reference. The Director of the  Office of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference  in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a  copy from the Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200), Center for Food  Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint  Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or you may examine a copy at the  Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Library, 5100 Paint  Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or at the National Archives and  Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of  this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http:// www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mean phage titer of each monophage in the additive is 1 x  10\9\ plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. The analytical method for  determining phage titer entitled ``Method to Determine Lytic Activity/ Phage Titer,'' dated November 6, 2001, and printed by Intralytix, Inc.,  is incorporated by reference. Copies are available at locations cited in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The phages present in the preparation must not contain a  functional portion of any of the toxin-encoding sequences described in  40 CFR 725.421(d). No sequences derived from genes encoding bacterial  16S ribosomal RNA are present in the complete genomic sequence of the  phages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> L. monocytogenes toxin, listeriolysin O (LLO), is not greater  than 5 hemolytic units (HU)/ml. The analytical method for determining  LLO entitled ``Quantitation of Listeriolysin O Levels in LMP-102\TM\,''  dated September 27, 2004, and printed by Intralytix, Inc., is  incorporated by reference. Copies are available at locations cited in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The additive is negative for L. monocytogenes. The modified  version of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's method for determining  L. monocytogenes entitled ``LMP-102\TM\ Listeria monocytogenes Sterility  Testing,'' dated May 24, 2004, and printed by Intralytix, Inc., is  incorporated by reference. Copies are available at locations cited in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The additive is negative for gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria capable of growing in commonly used microbiological media  (e.g., Luria-Bertani (LB) medium), including Escherichia coli,  Salmonella species and coagulase-positive Staphylococci, as determined  by the ``Method to Determine Microbial Contamination,'' dated July 11,  2003, and printed by Intralytix, Inc., is incorporated by reference.  Copies are available at locations cited in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Total organic carbon (TOC) is less than or equal to 36 mg/kg.  The analytical method for determining TOC entitled ``Determination of  Total Organic Carbon by Automated Analyzer,'' dated   March 30, 2001, and printed by Intralytix, Inc., is incorporated by  reference. Copies are available at locations cited in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of use. The additive is used in accordance with  current good manufacturing practice to control L. monocytogenes by  direct application to meat and poultry products that comply with the  ready-to-eat definition in 9 CFR 430.1. Current good manufacturing  practice is consistent with direct spray application of the additive at  a rate of approximately 1 mL of the additive per 500 cm\2\ product  surface area.
