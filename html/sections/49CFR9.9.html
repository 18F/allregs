                            <p class="depth0">In legal proceedings between private litigants:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The proper method for obtaining testimony or records from an  employee is to submit a request to agency counsel as provided in  Sec. Sec. 9.13 and 9.15 of this part, not to serve a demand on the  employee. Whenever, in a legal proceeding between private litigants, an  employee is served with a demand, or receives a request, to testify in  that employee's official capacity or produce records, the employee shall  immediately notify agency counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If authorized to testify pursuant to these rules, an employee  may testify only as to facts within that employee's personal knowledge  with regard to matters arising out of his or her official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the proceeding arises from an accident, an employee may  testify only as to personally known facts, not reasonably available from  other sources, observed by the employee or uncovered during the  employee's investigation of the accident or observed by the employee  even if he or she did not investigate the accident. The employee shall  decline to testify regarding facts beyond the scope of his or her  official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee shall not testify to facts that are contained in a  report, or any part of a report, unless the employee has obtained  permission from agency counsel to disclose the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee shall not disclose confidential or privileged  information unless the employee has obtained permission from agency  counsel to disclose the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employee shall not testify as to facts when agency counsel  determines that the testimony would not be in the best interest of the  Department or the United States if disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee shall not testify as an expert or opinion witness  with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties  or the functions of the Department. An employee who is asked questions  that call for expert or opinion testimony shall decline to answer on the  grounds that it is forbidden by this part. Agency counsel shall advise  the employee on how to proceed if the presiding officer directs the  employee to provide expert or opinion testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee shall not provide testimony at a trial or hearing.  An employee's testimony shall be limited to a single deposition,  affidavit, or set of interrogatories, concerning the circumstances (e.g.  an accident) from which the proceeding arose. Where multiple legal  proceedings concerning those circumstances are pending, or can occur, it  shall be the duty of the private litigant seeking the testimony to  ascertain, to the extent feasible, the identities of all parties, or  potential parties, to those proceedings and notify   them that a deposition has been granted and that they have the  opportunity to participate. The private litigant shall submit an  affidavit or certification describing the extent of the search for  parties and potential parties and listing the names of the parties and  potential parties notified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where an employee has already provided testimony, any party  wishing to obtain further testimony from that employee concerning the  same matter or occurrence, whether in the same or a different private  legal proceeding, may submit a request to agency counsel to waive the  restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The request shall, in  addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 9.15 of this part, state  why the requester should be permitted to gather additional information  despite not having previously requested the information when it had an  opportunity to do so, and why the additional testimony is now required  and the prior testimony or previously supplied documents are  insufficient.</p>
