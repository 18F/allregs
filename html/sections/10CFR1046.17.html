The essential functions and minimum competency levels must include, but are not limited to, the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the essential functions set forth in this part; task areas as specified by DOE; and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SO or to others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SO maintenance training. Each SO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of tasks and essential functions associated with SO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be based on a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SO's placement in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SO with the necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the job analysis. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SO status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SO knowledge, skills, and abilities. Each SO must possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to protect Department security interests from the theft, sabotage, and other acts that may harm national security, the facility, its employees, or the health and safety of the public. The requirements for each SO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the knowledge, skills, and abilities and the responsibilities necessary to perform the essential functions of the job must be based on the JA or METL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> SPOs--(1) SPO initial training requirements. Prior to initial assignment to duty, in addition to meeting SO training requirements described above in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each SPO must successfully complete the approved Department basic SPO training course. SPOs who are rehired at the same DOE facility or who have worked as an SPO at another DOE facility are not required to retake the basic training course as determined by a site-specific assessment of the individual. In addition to the basic SPO training course, SPO initial training must include successful completion of site-specific training objectives derived from a site-specific JA or METL, task areas as specified by DOE, and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SPO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SPO or to others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SPO initial training requirements.

In addition to meeting the SO maintenance training requirements described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each SPO must successfully complete an annual course of maintenance training to maintain the minimum level of competency required for the successful performance of essential functions and tasks associated with SPO job responsibilities. The type and intensity of training must be determined by a site-specific JA or METL. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SPO being placed in a remedial training program. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL

within clearly established time frames. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SPO status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SPO knowledge, skills and abilities. In addition to meeting the SO knowledge, skills and ability requirements described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the requirements for each SPO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the individual and collective knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the essential functions and the job tasks must be based on their applicable JA or METL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> SRT Members. In addition to satisfying the initial and maintenance training requirements for SPOs and meeting the SPO knowledge, skill, and ability requirements, SRT members must meet the following requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SRT initial training requirements. Prior to initial assignment to duty, each SRT-qualified SPO must successfully complete the current Department-approved SRT basic qualification course designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, and ability needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with SRT job responsibilities. SPOs who have previously successfully completed the SRT basic qualification course to work at another DOE facility do not have to retake the SRT basic qualification as determined by a site-specific assessment of the individual. After completion of the SRT basic qualification course, the SRT-qualified SPO must participate in a site-specific training program designed to provide the minimum level of knowledge and skills needed to competently perform all the identified essential functions of the job and tasks associated with site-specific SRT job responsibilities. The site-specific essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL, task areas as specified by DOE, and any other site-specific task areas that will ensure the SRT-qualified SPO's ability to perform all aspects of the assigned position under normal and emergency conditions without posing a direct threat to the SPO or to others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SRT maintenance training. After assignment to duties as a member of an SRT, an SRT-qualified SPO must receive maintenance training annually on each area required by a site-specific JA or METL. The annual maintenance training program must be completed over two or more sessions appropriately spaced throughout the year. Failure to achieve a minimum level of competency must result in the SRT-qualified SPO being placed in a remedial training program or removal from SRT qualification status, as determined by contractor management. The remedial training program must be tailored to provide the SRT-qualified SPO with necessary training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the level of competency required by the JA or METL. Failure to demonstrate competency at the completion of the remedial program must result in loss of SRT-qualification status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SRT knowledge, skills, and abilities. The requirements for each SRT-qualified SPO to demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the individual and collective knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the job tasks must include, but are not limited to, those identified for SPOs and based on their applicable JA or METL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Specialized requirements. PF personnel who are assigned specialized PF responsibilities outside the scope of normal duties must successfully complete the appropriate basic and maintenance training, as required by DOE and other applicable governing regulating authorities (e.g., Federal Aviation Administration). This training must enable the individual to achieve and maintain at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, ability needed to competently perform the tasks associated with the specialized job responsibilities, as well as maintain mandated certification, when applicable. Such personnel may include, but are not limited to, flight crews, instructors, armorers, central alarm system

operators, crisis negotiators, investigators, canine handlers, and law enforcement specialists. The assignment of such specialists and scope of such duties must be based on site-specific needs and approved by the local ODFSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Supervisors--(1) Supervisor training requirements. Prior to initial assignment to supervisory duty, each PF supervisor must successfully complete a supervisor training program designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, ability needed to competently perform all essential functions of the job and tasks associated with supervisory job responsibilities. Appropriate annual refresher training must be provided. The essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL and must include the essential functions and task areas identified for the level of PF personnel to be supervised. Armed supervisors of SPOs must be trained and qualified as SPOs. SPO supervisors must meet applicable medical and physical readiness qualification and certification standards for assigned response duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Supervisor training requirements. Prior to initial assignment to supervisory duty, each PF supervisor must successfully complete a supervisor training program designed to provide at least the minimum level of knowledge, skills, ability needed to competently perform all essential functions of the job and tasks associated with supervisory job responsibilities. Appropriate annual refresher training must be provided. The essential functions and minimum levels of competency must be based on a site-specific JA or METL and must include the essential functions and task areas identified for the level of PF personnel to be supervised. Armed supervisors of SPOs must be trained and qualified as SPOs. SPO supervisors must meet applicable medical and physical readiness qualification and certification standards for assigned response duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supervisor knowledge, skills, and abilities. Each PF supervisor must possess the skills necessary to effectively direct the actions of assigned personnel. Each supervisor must demonstrate proficiency in, and familiarity with, the responsibilities identified in the applicable JA or METL and proficiency in the skills and abilities necessary to perform those jobs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> PF training exercises. Exercises of various types must be included in the training and performance testing process for the purposes of achieving and maintaining skills and assessing individual, leader and collective competency levels. The types and frequency of training exercises must be determined by the training needs analysis conducted as part of the training program, and approved by the local ODFSA. These exercises must be planned and conducted to provide site-specific training to the PF in the prevention of the successful completion of potential adversarial acts as specified by DOE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Firearms qualification standards. (1) No person may be authorized to carry a firearm as an SPO until the responsible local ODFSA is assured that the individual who is to be armed with individually issued/primary weapons is qualified in accordance with firearms standards or that, in the case of post-specific crew-served and special weapons, a determination of proficiency and ability to operate the weapon safely has been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No person may be authorized to carry a firearm as an SPO until the responsible local ODFSA is assured that the individual who is to be armed with individually issued/primary weapons is qualified in accordance with firearms standards or that, in the case of post-specific crew-served and special weapons, a determination of proficiency and ability to operate the weapon safely has been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As a minimum, each SPO must meet the applicable firearms qualification or proficiency standards every six months under daylight and reduced lighting conditions. Requalification or proficiency demonstration must occur no earlier than 30 days prior to, and no later than 30 days after, six months from the previous qualification. In the case of individually assigned/primary weapons, if the SPO does not re-qualify during the re-qualification period, the individual's authority to be armed and to make arrests must be suspended following the unsuccessful qualification attempts as provided in paragraph (k)(11) of this section. For post-specific and crew-served weapons, if the SPO does not demonstrate proficiency during the re-qualification period, the individual's eligibility for assignment to posts having those post-specific or crew-served weapons must be suspended until such time as proficiency can be demonstrated. To facilitate training programs, employers may adjust qualification and proficiency demonstration schedules as long as the maximum durations as noted in this section are not exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> PF personnel must maintain firearms proficiency on a continuing basis. Therefore, an SPO may be required to demonstrate an ability to meet the applicable firearms qualification or proficiency standard(s) during a Headquarters or field audit, survey, inspection, or other situation directed by the local ODFSA. Failure to meet the standard must be treated as if the individual failed the first attempt during routine semiannual qualification or proficiency demonstration. See paragraph (k)(10) of this section. In the event the SPO fails both attempts, the requirements of paragraphs (k)(11) through (14) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each SPO must qualify with primary/individually-issued weapons required by duty assignment (to include: specialty weapons, long gun and/or handgun, if so armed). Qualification is the semiannual act of achieving a set score while demonstrating the ability to load, operate, and discharge a firearm or weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing the weapon at the conclusion of firing) according to a Departmentally-approved course of fire. At least one of the two semiannual qualifications must be accomplished with the same type of firearm or weapon system and ammunition equivalent in trajectory and recoil as that authorized for duty use. All qualification courses must: be constrained by time, identify the maximum amount of available ammunition, and include minimum scoring percentages required to qualify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For the purposes of this part, weapons system simulator means a device that closely simulates all major aspects of employing the corresponding actual firearm/weapons system, without firing live ammunition. The simulator should permit all weapons-handling and operational actions required by the actual weapon, and should allow the use of sight settings similar to the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads. Additionally, when weapons or weapons system simulators are used for qualification testing of protective force officers, the operation of the simulated weapon must closely approximate all weapons handling and operational manipulation actions required by the actual weapon. The simulation system must precisely register on-target hits and misses with accuracy comparable to the actual weapon at the same shooting distances. The weight, balance, and sighting systems should closely replicate those of the corresponding actual weapon with assigned duty loads, and noise signatures and felt recoil should be simulated to the extent technically feasible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> SPOs assigned to posts which require the operation of post-specific specialized or crew-served weapons must be trained and must demonstrate proficiency in the safe use of such weapons in a tactical environment. These proficiency courses must provide for the demonstration of skills required to support the site security plan. Ammunition equivalent in both trajectory and recoil to that used for duty must be used during an initial demonstration of proficiency. A weapons proficiency demonstration means a process based on a predetermined, objective set of criteria approved by the respective program office in consultation with the Office of Health, Safety and Security that results in a grade (e.g., pass/fail). The process must ensure that an individual (or team, for crew-served weapons) demonstrates the ability to perform all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing/returning to safe mode the weapon system at the conclusion of firing), without the necessity for scoring targets during the course of fire. Proficiency courses of fire must include tactically-relevant time constraints. Demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the actual weapon and assigned duty load, with alternate loads (e.g., frangible or dye-marking rounds), or with authorized weapons system simulators, as defined in this section. Proficiency courses of fire must be tactically relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Weapon system simulators may be used for training, familiarization, and semiannual proficiency verifications (e.g., engaging moving vehicles and/or aircraft). Demonstrations of proficiency must include all weapons-handling and operational manipulations necessary to load, operate, and discharge a weapon system accurately and safely (to include clearing the weapon at the conclusion of firing) according to a Departmentally-approved course of proficiency demonstration. Weapon demonstrations of proficiency are allowed with the same type of firearm or weapon system and ammunition equivalent in trajectory and recoil as that authorized for duty use, or with firearms simulators that have the features and capabilities as described in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each SPO must be given a presentation on the basic principles of weapons safety prior to any range activity. This does not require that a weapons safety presentation be given for each

course of fire, but does require that, prior to the start of range training or qualification for a given period (e.g., initial qualification, semiannual qualification, training, familiarization, proficiency testing, or range practice), each SPO must be given a range and weapon safety presentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Standardized Departmentally-approved firearm/weapon qualification courses must be used for qualification. Site-specific conditions and deployment of specialized firearms/weapons may justify requirements for developing and implementing supplementary special training and proficiency courses. Proficiency courses or demonstrations must be constrained by time limits. Where standardized Department firearms/weapons courses do not exist for a weapons system that is required to address site-specific concerns, both daylight and reduced lighting site-specific qualification or proficiency courses (as applicable) must be developed. After approval by the local ODFSA, the developed courses must be submitted to the respective program office for review and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> When qualification or demonstration of proficiency is prescribed, SPOs must be allowed two attempts to qualify with assigned firearms/weapons semiannually. A designated firearms instructor or other person in charge of the range must ensure the shooter understands that the attempt will be for qualification. Once this has been communicated by the firearms instructor or person in charge, the attempt must constitute an attempt to qualify or demonstrate proficiency. The SPO must qualify or demonstrate proficiency during one of these attempts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Upon suspension of an SPO's authority to carry firearms, in order to return to status, the SPO must enter a standardized, remedial firearms/weapons training program developed by the respective site PF contractor firearms training staff. The remedial training program must be a combination of basic weapon manipulation skills, firearms safety, and an additional segment of time individually designed to provide the SPO with the necessary individual training to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the firearms/weapons qualification or proficiency standards by addressing specific areas of performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> When qualification is required following the completion of the remedial training course, any SPO who fails to qualify after two subsequent attempts must lose SPO status and the authority to carry firearms/weapons and to make arrests. When weapons-specific safety or proficiency cannot be demonstrated, the SPO must not be assigned to posts that require the operation of that weapon until such safety or proficiency standards can be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Any SPO who requires remedial training on three consecutive semiannual qualification periods with the same type of firearm/weapon (caliber, make, and model, but not necessarily the exact same weapon) must be removed from duties that require the issuance of that weapon. If the weapon is considered a primary duty weapon; e.g., rifle or handgun, the officer must be removed from SPO status based on recurring inability to maintain qualification status. If an SPO requires remedial training for the same firearm during three consecutive semiannual qualification periods, then a fourth remediation shall not be offered for subsequent failures to achieve that firearms qualification standard. The employer may reinstate an individual removed from SPO status if the individual can demonstrate the ability to pass the current Department qualification course for that firearm. Prior to being given the opportunity to obtain reinstatement, the SPO must provide the employer written validation from a certified firearms instructor that the SPO has demonstrated the ability to meet applicable DOE standards. All such training and validation expenses are solely the responsibility of the SPO. If reinstatement under these circumstances occurs, the employer must provide all other training for returning protective force members according to the requirements of this part and as otherwise specified by DOE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> An appropriate Department record must be maintained for each SPO who qualifies or who attempts to qualify or to demonstrate proficiency. Records must be retained for one year after separation of a PF member from SPO duties, unless a longer retention

period is specified by other requirements. A supervisor or a training officer must be designated, in writing, as the individual authorized to certify the validity of the scores.</p>
