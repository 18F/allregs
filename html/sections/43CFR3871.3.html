L. 87-260; 75 Stat. 541), amends the Act of June 7, 1910 (36 Stat. 459; 48 U.S.C. 386), and provides that adverse suits against mineral entries in Alaska shall be instituted within the 60-day time limit set forth in R.S. 2325 and 2326, (30 U.S.C. 29, 30). The act further provides that where a mineral patent application was filed prior to the effective date of the act, the time in which to file adverse suits is governed by the Act of June 7, 1910. Where a mineral patent application was filed prior to September 21, 1961, the entry will not be allowed until after the expiration of eight months following the publication period.</p>
