Such 3-year period shall be the 3 years ending 30 days before the effective date of this standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator requests such approval in writing within 30 days after the effective date of this standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator submits a report to the Administrator within 45 days after the effective date of this standard which report includes the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description of sampling method including the method and frequency of calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Method of sample analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Averaging technique for determining 30-day average concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Number, identity, and location (address, coordinates, or distance and heading from plant) of sampling sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Ground elevations and height above ground of sampling inlets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Plant and sampling area plots showing emission points and sampling sites. Topographic features significantly affecting dispersion including plant building heights and locations shall be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Information necessary for estimating dispersion including stack height, inside diameter, exit gas temperature, exit velocity or flow rate, and beryllium concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> A description of data and procedures (methods or models) used to design the air sampling network (i.e., number and location of sampling sites).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Air sampling data indicating beryllium concentrations in the vicinity of the stationary source for the 3-year period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This data shall be presented chronologically and include the beryllium concentration and location of each individual sample taken by the network and the corresponding 30-day average beryllium concentrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days after receiving such report, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing whether approval is granted or denied. Prior to denying approval to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will consult with representatives of the statutory source for which the demonstration report was submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The burning of beryllium and/or beryllium-containing waste, except propellants, is prohibited except in incinerators, emissions from which must comply with the standard.
