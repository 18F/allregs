This determination shall be included with the procurement request package, which is transmitted to the contracting officer to initiate an action. The Form DS-4208 may be used to meet this requirement. The contracting officer shall obtain review from the Assistant Legal Adviser for Buildings and Acquisitions (L/BA) of any request package that the contracting officer determines raises substantial questions as to the performance of inherently governmental functions.
