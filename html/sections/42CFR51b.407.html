                                Sec.  51b.407  How can grant funds be used?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Grant funds awarded under this subpart may be used only for programs  approved under section 318(c), and with respect to public information  and education, those programs approved under section 318(b) of the Act.  Unless specifically approved, grant funds shall not be used for  performing diagnostic tests (other than gonorrhea screening tests),  maintaining central registries, purchasing data processing equipment, or  providing diagnostic and treatment facilities and services. The  applicant must provide assurances, however, that these services will be  available as needed as an adjunct to control program activities  supported with grant funds. To obtain special approval for grant support  of such activities, the grantee shall justify the exception to the  satisfaction of the Secretary that funds for this purpose are necessary  for the proper conduct of the program and are otherwise unavailable.  Support of these services will generally be approved only in the  following situations:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Special studies or demonstrations, (b) the support of  developmental or start-up activity, or (c) the support of an essential  service which will result in a savings to a detection or prevention  activity supported by the grant. Unless otherwise approved, exceptions  based on paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are only allowed during  one funding period. The grantee is expected to support these activities  in subsequent funding periods.  Subpart E [Reserved]</p>
