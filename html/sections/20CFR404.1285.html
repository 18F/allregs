                                Sec. 404.1285  Assessments of amounts due--for wages paid prior to 1987.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State is liable for any amount due (which includes  contributions or interest) under an agreement until the Commissioner is  satisfied that the amount has been paid to the Secretary of the  Treasury. If the Commissioner is not satisfied that a State has paid the  amount due, the Commissioner issues an assessment for the amount due  subject to the time limitations in Sec. 404.1286 and the exceptions to  the time limitations in Secs. 404.1287 and 404.1289. If detailed wage  information is not available, the assessment is issued based on the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The largest number of individuals whose services are known to be  covered under the agreement is used for computation purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The individuals are assumed to have maximum creditable earnings  each year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The earnings are considered wages for covered services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount computed is increased by twenty percent to insure  that all covered wages are included in the assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the State pays the amount assessed and the assessed amount is  later determined to be more than the amount actually due, we issue a  refund or credit to that State for the excess amount. When the  assessment is issued within the applicable time limitation, there is no  time limit on collecting the amount due. An assessment is issued on the  date that it is mailed or otherwise delivered to the State.  [53 FR 32976, Aug. 29, 1988, as amended at 62 FR 38451, July 18, 1997]</p>
