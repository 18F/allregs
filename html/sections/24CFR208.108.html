                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Projects specified in Sec. 208.104(a) that are automated. Project owners of applicable projects under Sec. 208.104(a) who currently use an automated software package to process certifications and recertifications and to provide subsidy billings to HUD must update their software packages and begin electronic transmission of that data in a HUD specified format by March 21, 1994. These project owners are required to transmit data collected for the 12 months preceding March 21, 1994, as well as data collected on or after this date. Data collected for the 12 months preceding March 21, 1994, is to include only the tenant's most recent ``complete certification'' (move-in, initial certification, interim recertification, or annual recertification). When the most recent certification for a tenant is a partial certification (gross rent change, unit transfer, or correction), both the complete and partial certifications must be transmitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Projects specified in Sec. 208.104(a) that are not automated.

Project owners of applicable projects under Sec. 208.104(c) must electronically transmit data for certification, recertification and subsidy billing procedures to HUD in a HUD specified format.
