                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Agency, we, our, or us means the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial filming means the film, electronic, magnetic, digital, or other recording of a moving image by a person, business, or other entity for a market audience with the intent of generating income. Examples include, but are not limited to, feature film, videography, television broadcast, or documentary, or other similar projects. Commercial filming activities may include the advertisement of a product or service, or the use of actors, models, sets, or props.</p><p class="depth0">Cost recovery means the money that an agency collects as reimbursement for actual costs it incurred to permit a particular activity, including but not limited to, accepting and processing a permit application and monitoring the permitted commercial filming or still photography activity.</p><p class="depth0">Location fee means a land or facility use fee similar to rent that provides a fair return to the United States for the use of Federal lands or facilities when used for:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Commercial filming activities or similar projects; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Still photography activities where a permit is required.</p><p class="depth0">Model means a person or object that serves as the subject for commercial

filming or still photography for the purpose of promoting the sale or use of a product or service. Models include, but are not limited to, individuals, animals, or inanimate objects, such as vehicles, boats, articles of clothing, and food and beverage products, placed on agency lands so that they may be filmed or photographed to promote the sale or use of a product or service. For the purposes of this part, portrait subjects such as wedding parties and high school graduates are not considered models, if the image will not be used to promote or sell a product or service.</p><p class="depth0">News means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public, gathered by news-media entities for dissemination to the public. Examples of news-media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the general public and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> As methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), these alternative media will be considered to be news-media entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A freelance journalist is regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, even if the journalist is not actually employed by the entity. A contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; we may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</p><p class="depth2">News-gathering activities means filming, videography, and still photography activities carried out by a representative of the news media.</p><p class="depth2">Permit means a written authorization to engage in uses or activities that are otherwise prohibited or restricted.</p><p class="depth2">Representative of the news media means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.</p><p class="depth2">Resource damage means harm to the land or its natural or cultural resources that cannot reasonably be mitigated or reclaimed.</p><p class="depth2">Sets and props means items constructed or placed on agency lands to facilitate commercial filming or still photography including, but not limited to, backdrops, generators, microphones, stages, lighting banks, camera tracks, vehicles specifically designed to accommodate camera or recording equipment, rope and pulley systems, and rigging for climbers and structures. Sets and props also include trained animals and inanimate objects, such as camping equipment, campfires, wagons, and so forth, when used to stage a specific scene. The use of a camera on a tripod, without the use of any other equipment, is not considered a prop.</p><p class="depth2">Still photography means the capturing of a still image on film or in a digital format.</p><p class="depth2">Videography means the process of capturing moving images on electronic media, e.g., video tape, hard disk or solid state storage.</p>
