                            <p class="depth0">An offer may not be rejected for failure of the offered product to  equal a characteristic of a brand name product if it was not specified  in the brand name or equal description. However, if it is clearly  established that the unspecified characteristic is essential to the  intended end use, the solicitation is defective and no award may be  made. In such cases, the contracting officer should resolicit the  requirements, using a purchase description that sets forth the essential  characteristics.</p>
