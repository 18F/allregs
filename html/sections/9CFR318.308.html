If a deviation is noted at any time before the completion of the intended process schedule, the establishment shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Immediately reprocess the product using the full process schedule; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use an appropriate alternate process schedule provided such a process schedule has been established in accordance with Sec. 318.302 (a) and (b) and is filed with the inspector in accordance with Sec. 318.302(c); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hold the product involved and have the deviation evaluated by a processing authority to assess the safety and stability of the product. Upon completion of the evaluation, the establishment shall provide the inspector the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A complete description of the deviation along with all necessary supporting documentation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A copy of the evaluation report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A description of any product disposition actions, either taken or proposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Product handled in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section

Regardless of the procedure used, containers in the retort intake valve and in transfer valves between retort shells at the time of a jam or breakdown shall be removed and either reprocessed, repacked and reprocessed and or destroyed.
