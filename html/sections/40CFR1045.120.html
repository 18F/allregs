                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new engine, including all parts of its emission control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Warranty period. Your emission-related warranty must be valid during the periods specified in this paragraph (b). You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for an engine may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component. If an engine has no hour meter, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the engine's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum warranty period for outboard engines is 175 hours of engine operation or 5 years, whichever comes first. The minimum warranty period for personal watercraft engines is 175 hours of engine operation or 30 months, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum warranty period for sterndrive/inboard engines is shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Sec.   1045.120--Warranty Periods for Sterndrive/Inboard</p><p class="depth3">Engines \1\------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Electronic</p><p class="depth3">Engine type              components      Mechanical components------------------------------------------------------------------------Conventional.................  3 years/480      3 years/480 hours.</p><p class="depth3">hours.High-performance with maximum  3 years/480      3 years/150 hours.</p><p class="depth3">engine power at or below 485   hours.</p><p class="depth3">kW.High-performance with maximum  3 years/480      1 year/50 hours.</p><p class="depth3">engine power above 485 kW.     hours.------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The warranty period expires after the specified time period or</p><p class="depth3">number of operating hours, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you

develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.</p>
