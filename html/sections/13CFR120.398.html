Interest will accrue only until the date 120 days after the earliest uncured payment default on the ARC Loan. However, the amount paid by SBA on a defaulted ARC Loan, when it honors its guarantee, will be adjusted to reconcile for any overpayments or underpayments of interest previously paid to the Lender. Interim adjustments to interest paid by SBA to lenders may be made during the term of the ARC Loan and interest payments due the Lender will be adjusted to accommodate the interim interest adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deferral period.
