                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State plan requirements. If a State plan for OAA, AB, APTD, or  AABD under the Social Security Act includes provisions for protective  payments, the State plan must provide that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods will be in effect to determine that needy individuals  have, by reason of physical or mental condition, such inability to  manage funds that making payment to them would be contrary to their  welfare; such methods to include medical or psychological evaluations,  or other reports of physical or mental conditions including observation  of gross conditions such as extensive paralysis, serious mental  retardation, continued disorientation, or severe memory loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There will be responsibility to assure referral to social  services for appropriate action to protect recipients where problems and  needs for services and care of the recipients are manifestly beyond the  ability of the protective payee to handle. (See paragraph (a)(5) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standards will be established for selection of protective payees  who are   interested in or concerned with the individual's welfare, to act for the  individual in receiving and managing assistance, with the selection of a  protective payee being made by the individual, or with his participation  and consent, to the extent possible. If it is in the best interest of  the individual for a staff member of a private agency, of the public  welfare department, or of any other appropriate organization to serve as  a protective payee, such selection will be made preferably from the  staff of an agency or that part of the agency providing protective  services for families or for the disabled or aged group of which the  recipient is a member; and such staff of the public welfare department  will be utilized only to the extent that the department has adequate  staff for this purpose. The selection will not include: The executive  head of the agency administering public assistance; the person  determining financial eligibility for the individual; special  investigative or resource staff, or staff handling fiscal processes  related to the recipient; or landlords, grocers, or other vendors of  goods or services dealing directly with the recipient--such as the  proprietor, administrator or fiscal agent of a nursing home, or social  care, medical or nonmedical institution, except for the superintendent  of a public institution for mental diseases or a public institution for  the mentally retarded, or the designee of such superintendent, when no  other suitable protective payee can be found and there are appropriate  staff available to assist the superintendent in carrying out the  protective payment function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Protective payments will be made only in cases in which the  assistance payment, with other available income, meets all the needs of  the individual, using the State's standards for assistance for the  pertinent program, not standards for protective payment cases only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agency will undertake and continue special efforts to  protect the welfare of such individuals and to improve, to the extent  possible, their capacity for self-care and to manage funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reconsideration of the need for protective payments and the way  in which a protective payee's responsibilities are carried out will be  as frequent as indicated by the individual's circumstances and at least  every 6 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provision will be made for appropriate termination of protective  payments as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When individuals are considered able to manage funds in their  best interest, there will be a return to money payment status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal  representative appears to serve the best interest of the individual,  such appointment will be sought and the protective payment will  terminate when the appointment has been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Opportunity for a fair hearing will be given to any individual  claiming assistance in relation to the determination that a protective  payment should be made or continued, and in relation to the payee  selected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal financial participation. Federal financial participation  is available for payments, which otherwise qualify as money payments  with respect to a needy individual, but which are made to a protective  payee under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The payment must be  supported by an authorization of award through amendment of an existing  authorization document for such case or by preparation of a separate  authorization document. In either instance, the authorization document  must be a formal agency record signed by a responsible agency official  showing the name of each eligible individual, the amount of payment  authorized and the name of the protective payee. Payrolls must identify  protective payment cases either by use of a separate payroll for these  cases or by using a special identifying code or symbol on the regular  payroll.
