                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> In general. A material advisor who is required to file a return under section 6111(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) with respect to any reportable transaction who fails to file a timely return in accordance with Sec. 301.6111-3(e) or who files a return with false or incomplete information with respect to the reportable transaction will be subject to a penalty. A material advisor who fails to file a timely return or who files a false or incomplete return with respect to more than one reportable transaction will be subject to a separate section 6707 penalty for each transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A material advisor who is required to file a return under section 6111(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) with respect to any reportable transaction who fails to file a timely return in accordance with Sec. 301.6111-3(e) or who files a return with false or incomplete information with respect to the reportable transaction will be subject to a penalty. A material advisor who fails to file a timely return or who files a false or incomplete return with respect to more than one reportable transaction will be subject to a separate section 6707 penalty for each transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reportable transactions. The amount of the penalty for failing to timely file a return under section 6111(a), or filing the return with false or incomplete information with respect to any reportable transaction other than a listed transaction is $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Listed transactions. (A) In general. The amount of the penalty for failing to timely file a return under section 6111(a), or filing the return with false or incomplete information with respect to a listed transaction is the greater of $200,000 or 50 percent of the gross income derived by the material advisor with respect to aid, assistance, or advice that is provided with respect to the listed transaction before the date the return is filed under section 6111.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The amount of the penalty for failing to timely file a return under section 6111(a), or filing the return with false or incomplete information with respect to a listed transaction is the greater of $200,000 or 50 percent of the gross income derived by the material advisor with respect to aid, assistance, or advice that is provided with respect to the listed transaction before the date the return is filed under section 6111.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Intentional action or failure. If the failure or action subject to the penalty is with respect to a listed transaction and is intentional, the penalty is the greater of $200,000 or 75 percent of the gross income derived by the material advisor with respect to aid, assistance, or advice that is provided with respect to the listed transaction before the date the return is filed under section 6111.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Transaction that is both a listed transaction and reportable transaction other than a listed transaction. In the case of a penalty imposed under section 6707 with respect to a transaction that is both a listed transaction and a reportable transaction other than a listed transaction, the penalty under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), and not the penalty under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross income derived by the material advisor. For purposes of calculating the amount of the penalty with respect to a listed transaction, the gross income derived by the material advisor will be determined in accordance with Sec. 301.6111-3(b)(3)(ii) of this chapter. If a person is a material advisor with regard to more than one type of listed transaction, the gross income derived from each type of listed transaction will be considered separately and will not be aggregated to determine the amount of any section 6707 penalty for failing to make a proper return under section 6111(a). Further, only gross income derived from listed transactions for which the advisor is a material advisor under section 6111 is taken into account for purposes of computing the penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Derive. The term ``derive'' is defined in Sec. 301.6111-3(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Derive. The term ``derive'' is defined in Sec. 301.6111-3(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> False information. For purposes of this section, the term ``false information'' means information provided on a Form 8918, ``Material Advisor Disclosure Statement'' (or successor form), filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that is untrue or incorrect when the Form 8918 (or successor form) was filed. False information does not include information provided on a Form 8918 (or successor form) filed with the IRS that is immaterial or that is untrue or incorrect due to a mistake or accident after the exercise of reasonable care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incomplete information. For purposes of this section, the term ``incomplete information'' means a Form 8918 (or successor form) filed with the IRS that does not provide the information required under Sec. 301.6111-3(d). A Form 8918 (or successor form) filed with the IRS will not be considered incomplete when the information not provided on the form is immaterial or was not provided due to mistake or accident after the exercise of reasonable care. Whether information is immaterial will be determined based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding each failure to file or filing of an incomplete return. A material advisor who completes the form to the best of the material advisor's ability and knowledge after the exercise of reasonable effort to obtain the information will not be considered to have filed incomplete information within the meaning of this section. A Form 8918 (or successor form) will be considered to provide incomplete information when it omits information required to be provided under Sec. 301.6111-3(d) or contains a statement that the omitted information will be provided upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Intentional. For purposes of this section, the failure to timely file a return or the submission of a return with false or incomplete information is intentional if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The material advisor knew of the obligation to file a return and knowingly did not timely file a return with the IRS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The material advisor filed a return knowing that it was false or incomplete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Listed transaction. The term ``listed transaction'' is defined in section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Material Advisor. The term ``material advisor'' is defined in section 6111(b)(1) of the Code and Sec. 301.6111-3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reportable transaction. The term ``reportable transaction'' is defined in section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assessment of penalty--(1) Intentional failure determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Whether a material advisor intentionally failed to timely file a return or intentionally filed a false or incomplete return will be determined based upon all the facts and circumstances surrounding the non-filing or filing of a false and/or incomplete return. The higher penalty under the flush language of section 6707(b)(2) will not apply to any material advisor whose failure to timely file or whose furnishing of false or incomplete information was unintentional. The failure to timely file a return, or filing a return with false or incomplete information, will be considered unintentional if the material advisor subsequently files a true and complete return prior to the earlier of the date that any taxpayer files a Form 8886, ``Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement'' (or successor form) identifying the material advisor with respect to the reportable transaction in question, or the date the IRS contacts the material advisor concerning the reportable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentional failure determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Whether a material advisor intentionally failed to timely file a return or intentionally filed a false or incomplete return will be determined based upon all the facts and circumstances surrounding the non-filing or filing of a false and/or incomplete return. The higher penalty under the flush language of section 6707(b)(2) will not apply to any material advisor whose failure to timely file or whose furnishing of false or incomplete information was unintentional. The failure to timely file a return, or filing a return with false or incomplete information, will be considered unintentional if the material advisor subsequently files a true and complete return prior to the earlier of the date that any taxpayer files a Form 8886, ``Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement'' (or successor form) identifying the material advisor with respect to the reportable transaction in question, or the date the IRS contacts the material advisor concerning the reportable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual liability in the case of more than one material advisor. If there is more than one material advisor who is responsible for filing a return under section 6111 with respect to the same reportable transaction, a separate penalty under section 6707 may be assessed against each material advisor who fails to timely file or files a return with false or incomplete information. The determination of whether the failure or action subject to the penalty is intentional will be made individually for each material advisor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Designation agreements. A material advisor who is required to file a return under section 6111 and who is a party to a designation agreement within the meaning of Sec. 301.6111-3(f) is subject to a penalty under section 6707 if the designated material advisor fails to file a return timely or files a return with false or incomplete information. In the case of a listed transaction, if the designated material advisor fails to file a return timely, or files a return with false or incomplete information, the nondesignated material advisor who is a party to the designation agreement will not be treated as intentionally failing to file the return, or intentionally filing a return with false or incomplete information, unless the nondesignated material advisor knew or should have known that the designated material advisor would fail to file a true and complete return timely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Advisor A becomes a material advisor as defined under section 6111(b)(1) and Sec. 301.6111-3(b) in the fourth quarter of 2014 with respect to a reportable transaction other than a listed transaction, and Advisor B also becomes a material advisor in the same quarter with respect to the same reportable transaction. Advisors A and B fail to timely file the Form 8918 with respect to the reportable transaction. Under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the penalty for failure by a material advisor to timely disclose a reportable transaction other than a listed transaction is $50,000. Because the section 6707 penalty applies to each material advisor independently under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Advisors A and B each are subject to a section 6707 penalty of $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Same as Example 1, except that Advisor B timely files the Form 8918. Advisors A and B did not enter into a designation agreement. Accordingly, paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply and only Advisor A is subject to a $50,000 section 6707 penalty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Advisor C becomes a material advisor to Client X on January 5, 2015, with respect to a listed transaction. Advisor C derives $400,000 in gross income from his advice to Client X because he expects to receive that amount from Client X, even though he has not yet received that amount. On January 5, 2016, Advisor C becomes a material advisor to Client Y with respect to the same type of listed transaction. Advisor C derives $100,000 in gross income from his advice to Client Y because he expects to receive that amount from Client Y, even though he has not yet received that amount. At no time did Advisor C file a Form 8918 to disclose the

listed transaction. For purposes of this example, assume that Advisor C's failure to file a Form 8918 was unintentional. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Advisor C is subject to a section 6707 penalty based on the gross income derived from Client X and Client Y. Accordingly, Advisor C is subject to a penalty of $250,000 (50 percent of $500,000, the gross income derived from Clients X and Y).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Same as Example 3, except that the gross income Advisor C expects to receive from his advice to Client Y (a C corporation) is $20,000. Because the material advisor fee threshold is not satisfied with respect to Client Y, Advisor C is not a material advisor to Client Y with respect to the listed transaction. Advisor C is, however, a material advisor with respect to Client X with respect to the same listed transaction. Therefore, Advisor C is subject to a section 6707 penalty with respect to the failure to timely file a Form 8918 disclosing the listed transaction. Although Advisor C provided advice with respect to two transactions that are the same type of listed transaction, Advisor C was only a material advisor with respect to advice provided to Client X. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section Advisor C is subject to a section 6707 penalty based only on the gross income derived from Client X. Accordingly, Advisor C is subject to a penalty of $200,000 (50 percent of $400,000, the gross income derived from Client X).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Same as Example 3, except that Advisor C files a Form 8918 disclosing the listed transaction on November 16, 2015. Because Advisor C becomes a material advisor to Client X on January 5, 2015, the Form 8918 is required to be filed on or before April 30, 2015 (the last day of the month that follows the end of the calendar quarter in which the advisor became a material advisor with regard to the reportable transaction). See Sec. 301.6111-3(e). Therefore, Advisor C did not timely file the Form 8918. Advisor C is subject to a $200,000 penalty under section 6707 for his unintentional failure because, as of the date he filed the Form 8918, the gross income Advisor C had received or expected to receive with respect to advice relating to a listed transaction that was not disclosed only included $400,000 of gross income for advice to Client X. By the time that Advisor C provides advice to Client Y on January 5, 2016, Advisor C has disclosed the listed transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Same as Example 3, except that Advisor C files the Form 8918 on February 16, 2016, disclosing the listed transaction. Because Advisor C first becomes a material advisor with respect to the listed transaction on January 5, 2015, the Form 8918 is required to be filed on or before April 30, 2015 regardless of the fact that Advisor C is also a material advisor to a second client, Client Y, with respect to the same listed transaction. This is because under the facts of Example 3, Advisor C ``becomes'' a material advisor on January 5, 2015. The date on which a material advisor ``becomes'' a material advisor is determinative of the due date for the Form 8918 under Sec. 301.6111-3(e). Therefore, when Advisor C files the Form 8918 on February 16, 2016, the form is not timely filed under section 6111. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Advisor C is subject to a penalty under section 6707 of $250,000 (50 percent of $500,000) because, as of the date that the Form 8918 was filed, the gross income that Advisor C received or expected to receive as a material advisor with respect to a listed transaction that was not disclosed included gross income for advice to both Client X ($400,000) and Client Y ($100,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Advisor D becomes a material advisor as defined under section 6111(b)(1) and Sec. 301.6111-3(b) in the first quarter of 2016 with respect to a reportable transaction other than a listed transaction. Advisor D does not file a Form 8918 by April 30, 2016. The transaction is then identified as a listed transaction in published guidance on July 7, 2016. Advisor D knew that he had a new obligation to file a Form 8918 by October 31, 2016, and intentionally fails to file the Form 8918. Advisor D is subject to only one penalty, in the amount of the greater of $200,000, or 75 percent of the gross income he derived from the transaction, for intentionally failing to disclose the listed transaction in accordance with Sec. 301.6111-3(d)(1) and (e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Same as Example 7, except that Advisor D filed a Form 8918 disclosing the listed transaction on October 15, 2016. As a result of that disclosure, Advisor D is not subject to the section 6707 penalty amount described in Sec. 301.6707-1(a)(1)(ii). However, because Advisor D did not timely file a Form 8918 by April 30, 2016, the due date for the Form 8918 with respect to the reportable transaction for which Advisor D became a material advisor in the first quarter of 2016, Advisor D is subject to a section 6707 penalty of $50,000 as described in Sec. 301.6707-1(a)(1)(i). The disclosure of the listed transaction does not correct Advisor D's initial failure to disclose the reportable transaction by April 30, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rescission authority--(1) In general. The Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may rescind the section 6707 penalty if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may rescind the section 6707 penalty if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The violation relates to a reportable transaction that is not a listed transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rescinding the penalty would promote compliance with the requirements of the Code and effective tax administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requesting rescission. The Secretary may prescribe the procedures

for a material advisor to request rescission of a section 6707 penalty by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Factors that weigh in favor of granting rescission. In determining whether rescission would promote compliance with the requirements of the Code and effective tax administration, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will take into account the following list of factors that weigh in favor of granting rescission. This is not an exclusive list, and no single factor will be determinative of whether to grant rescission in any particular case. Rather, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will consider and weigh all relevant factors, regardless of whether the factor is included in this list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The material advisor, upon becoming aware of the failure to disclose a reportable transaction in accordance with section 6111 and the regulations thereunder, filed a complete and proper, albeit untimely, Form 8918 (or successor form). This factor weighs in favor of rescission if circumstances suggest that the material advisor did not delay in filing an untimely but properly completed Form 8918 (or successor form) until after the IRS had taken steps to identify the person as a material advisor with respect to the reportable transaction. For instance, this factor will weigh strongly in favor of rescission if the material advisor files the Form 8918 (or successor form) prior to the date the IRS contacts the material advisor concerning the reportable transaction. However, this factor will not weigh in favor of rescission if the facts and circumstances indicate that the material advisor delayed filing the Form 8918 (or successor form) until after a taxpayer files a Form 8886 (or successor form) identifying the material advisor with respect to the reportable transaction in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The material advisor's failure to disclose the reportable transaction properly was due to an unintentional mistake of fact that existed despite the material advisor's reasonable attempts to ascertain the correct facts with respect to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The material advisor has an established history of properly disclosing other reportable transactions and complying with other tax laws, including compliance with any requests made by the IRS under section 6112, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The material advisor demonstrates that the failure to include on any return or statement any information required to be disclosed under section 6111 arose from events beyond the material advisor's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The material advisor cooperates with the IRS by providing timely information with respect to the transaction at issue that the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may request in consideration of the rescission request. In considering whether a material advisor cooperates with the IRS, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will take into account whether the material advisor meets the deadlines described in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin for complying with requests for additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Assessment of the penalty weighs against equity and good conscience, including whether the material advisor demonstrates that there was reasonable cause for, and the material advisor acted in good faith with respect to, the failure to timely file or to include on any return any information required to be disclosed under section 6111. An important factor in determining reasonable cause and good faith is the extent of the material advisor's efforts to determine whether there was a requirement to file the return required under section 6111. The presence of reasonable cause, however, will not necessarily be determinative of whether to grant rescission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Absence of favorable factors weighs against rescission. The absence of facts establishing the factors described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section weighs against granting rescission. The presence or absence of any one of these factors, however, will not necessarily be determinative of whether to grant rescission; rather the determination will be made in consideration of all of the factors and any other facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Factors not considered. In determining whether to grant rescission, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's

delegate) will not consider doubt as to collectability of, or liability for, the penalties (except that the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may consider doubt as to liability to the extent it is a factor in the determination of reasonable cause and good faith).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. The rules of this section apply to returns the due date for which is after July 31, 2014.

Sec. 301.6707A-1  Failure to include on any return or statement anyinformation required to be disclosed under section 6011 with respectto a reportable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Any person who fails to include on any return or statement any information required to be disclosed under section 6011 with respect to a reportable transaction may be subject to a monetary penalty. Subject to maximum and minimum limits, the penalty for failure to include information with respect to any reportable transaction is 75 percent of the decrease in tax shown on the return as a result of the transaction or the decrease that would have resulted from the transaction if it were respected for Federal tax purposes. The penalty for failure to include information with respect to a listed transaction shall not exceed $100,000 for a natural person and $200,000 for all other persons. The penalty for failure to include information with respect to any other reportable transaction shall not exceed $10,000 for a natural person and $50,000 for all other persons. The penalty with respect to any reportable transaction shall not be less than $5,000 for a natural person and $10,000 for all other persons. The section 6707A penalty is in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Reportable transaction. The term ``reportable transaction'' is defined in section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reportable transaction. The term ``reportable transaction'' is defined in section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Listed transaction. The term ``listed transaction'' is defined in section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assessment of the penalty--(1) In general. The Internal Revenue Service may assess a penalty under section 6707A with respect to each failure to disclose a reportable transaction within the time and in the form and manner provided by Sec. Sec. 1.6011-4(d) and 1.6011-4(e) of this chapter or pursuant to the time, form, and manner stated in other published guidance. Section 1.6011-4(e) provides, in part, that a taxpayer must attach a disclosure statement to the taxpayer's return for each taxable year for which the taxpayer participates in a reportable transaction. A taxpayer also must attach a disclosure statement to each amended return that reflects the taxpayer's participation in a reportable transaction and, if a reportable transaction results in a loss that is carried back to a prior year, a taxpayer must attach a disclosure statement to the taxpayer's application for tentative refund or amended return for that prior year. In addition, a copy of the disclosure statement must be sent to the IRS Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at the same time that any disclosure statement is first filed by the taxpayer pertaining to a particular reportable transaction. Nonetheless, a taxpayer who is required to disclose a transaction by filing Form 8886, ``Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement,'' (or successor form) with a return (including an amended return or application for tentative refund) and who is also required to disclose the transaction by filing that form with OTSA, is subject to only a single section 6707A penalty for failure to make either one or both of those disclosures. If section 6011 and the regulations thereunder require a disclosure statement to be filed at the time that a return is filed, the disclosure statement is considered to be timely filed if it is filed at the same time as the return, even if the return is filed untimely after its due date (including extensions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer T is required to attach a Form 8886 to its return for the 2008 taxable year and to send a copy of the Form 8886 to OTSA at the time it files its return. Taxpayer T fails to attach the Form 8886 to its

return and fails to send a copy of the Form 8886 to OTSA. Taxpayer T is subject to a single penalty under section 6707A for failure to disclose because Taxpayer T failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of section 6011 as described in Sec. Sec. 1.6011-4(d) and 1.6011-4(e) of this chapter. A penalty under section 6707A also would apply if Taxpayer T had failed to comply with only one of the two requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Same as Example 1, except that Taxpayer T also subsequently files an amended return for 2008 that reflects Taxpayer T's participation in the reportable transaction described in Example 1. Taxpayer T fails to attach a Form 8886 to the amended return as required by Sec. 1.6011-4(e)(1) of this chapter. Taxpayer T is subject to an additional penalty under section 6707A for failing to disclose a reportable transaction on the amended return for 2008.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In November 2009, Taxpayer U participates in a reportable transaction resulting in a loss. On March 15, 2010, Taxpayer U files its 2009 return, on which it reports the loss and to which it fails to attach a Form 8886. One month later, Taxpayer U files an amended return for 2008, on which it carries back the loss and to which it fails to attach a Form 8886. Section 1.6011-4(e)(1) of this chapter requires Taxpayer U to attach a Form 8886 to its amended return for the 2008 taxable year. Taxpayer U is subject to two penalties under section 6707A: one for the failure to attach Form 8886 to its amended return for 2008 and another for the failure to attach Form 8886 to its 2009 return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Taxpayer V participates in a nonlisted reportable transaction and is required to attach a Form 8886 to its return for the 2009 taxable year that is due on March 15, 2010. Taxpayer V timely files its return but fails to attach the Form 8886 to its return. After the due date of Taxpayer V's return and without an extension of time to file, Taxpayer V files an amended return relating to the 2009 taxable year to which Taxpayer V attaches the Form 8886. Taxpayer V is subject to a penalty under section 6707A for failure to disclose because Taxpayer V failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of section 6011 (described in Sec. 1.6011-4(e)(1) of this chapter) by not attaching a Form 8886 to its original return for the 2009 taxable year that was timely filed on or before the due date of March 15, 2010. An additional penalty under section 6707A would apply if Taxpayer V had failed to attach a Form 8886 to its amended return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Shareholder W, a shareholder in an S Corporation, receives a timely Schedule K-1, ``Shareholder's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.,'' on April 10, 2009, and determines that she is required to attach a Form 8886 to her individual income tax return for the 2008 taxable year. Shareholder W fails to attach the Form 8886 to her 2008 individual income tax return but files a proper and complete Form 8886 with OTSA on June 12, 2009. Section 1.6011-4(e)(1) of this chapter provides that if a taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership, a shareholder in an S corporation, or a beneficiary of a trust receives a timely Schedule K-1 less than 10 calendar days before the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions) and, based on receipt of the timely Schedule K-1, the taxpayer determines that the taxpayer participated in a reportable transaction, the disclosure statement will not be considered late if the taxpayer discloses the reportable transaction by filing a disclosure statement with OTSA within 60 calendar days after the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions). Accordingly, Shareholder W is not subject to a penalty under section 6707A for failure to disclose.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. In July 2008, Taxpayer X participates in Transaction Z, a transaction that is not reportable as of April 15, 2009, the date Taxpayer X files his individual income tax return for 2008. On July 15, 2009, Transaction Z is identified as a transaction of interest. Section 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i) of this chapter provides that if a transaction that is not otherwise a reportable transaction becomes a listed transaction or a transaction of interest after the taxpayer has filed a tax return (including an amended return) reflecting the taxpayer's participation in the listed transaction or transaction of interest and before the end of the period of limitations for assessment of tax for any taxable year in which the taxpayer participated in the listed transaction or transaction of interest, then a disclosure statement must be filed with OTSA within 90 calendar days after the date on which the transaction became a listed transaction or transaction of interest, regardless of whether the taxpayer participated in the transaction in the year the transaction became a listed transaction or a transaction of interest. Taxpayer X fails to file a Form 8886 with OTSA by October 13, 2009, 90 calendar days after the date that the transaction was identified as a transaction of interest. Accordingly, Taxpayer X is subject to a penalty under section 6707A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Taxpayer Y is required to attach a Form 8886 to its return for the 2008 taxable year with respect to participation in a listed transaction. Taxpayer Y attaches the Form 8886 to its timely filed return. The Form 8886, however, does not describe all of the potential tax benefits expected to result from this transaction and states that information will be provided upon request. Because the Form 8886 does not describe all of the potential tax benefits expected to result from the transaction and merely provides that the information will be provided upon request, the Form 8886 filed by Taxpayer Y is

incomplete and does not satisfy the requirements set forth in Sec. 1.6011-4(d) of this chapter. Taxpayer Y is subject to a penalty under section 6707A for failure to disclose in the appropriate manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rescission authority--(1) In general.

The Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may rescind the section 6707A penalty if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The violation relates to a reportable transaction that is not a listed transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rescinding the penalty would promote compliance with the requirements of the Code and effective tax administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requesting rescission. The Secretary may prescribe the procedures for a taxpayer to request rescission of a section 6707A penalty with respect to a reportable transaction other than a listed transaction by publishing a revenue procedure or other guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Factors that weigh in favor of granting rescission. In determining whether rescission would promote compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and effective tax administration, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will take into account the following list of factors that weigh in favor of granting rescission. This is not an exclusive list and no single factor will be determinative of whether to grant rescission in any particular case. Rather, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will consider and weigh all relevant factors, regardless of whether the factor is included in this list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer, upon becoming aware that it failed, in whole or in part, to disclose a reportable transaction in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.6011-4 of this chapter, filed a complete and proper, albeit untimely, Form 8886 (or successor form), as required by Sec. 1.6011-4. If the penalty is due to the taxpayer's failure to file Form 8886 (or successor form) with a return (including an amended return or application for tentative refund), in order for an untimely disclosure to weigh in favor of rescission, the taxpayer must file an amended return with the appropriate Service Center and attach a complete and proper Form 8886 (or successor form) to that amended return. The amended return filed with the untimely Form 8886 (or successor form) must not reflect any other changes to the return (including an amended return or application for tentative refund) that it amends, and the taxpayer must, in the space provided for an explanation of changes on the amended return, state the reason for filing the amended return. If the penalty is due to the taxpayer's failure to file Form 8886 (or successor form) with OTSA, in order for an untimely disclosure to weigh in favor of rescission, the taxpayer must file a complete and proper Form 8886 (or successor form) with OTSA. If the taxpayer fails to file a complete and proper Form 8886 (or successor form) with the return (including an amended return or application for tentative refund) and also fails to file a copy of the complete and proper Form 8886 (or successor form) with OTSA, incurring one penalty for both failures, then the taxpayer must, in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (d)(3)(i), file complete and proper Forms 8886 with both the Service Center and OTSA in order for the untimely disclosures to weigh in favor of rescission. This factor will weigh heavily in favor of rescission provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer files the Form 8886 prior to the date the IRS first contacts the taxpayer (including contacts by the IRS with any partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner, any S corporation in which the taxpayer is a shareholder, or any trust in which the taxpayer is a beneficiary) concerning a tax examination for the tax period in which the taxpayer participated in the reportable transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other circumstances suggest that the taxpayer did not delay filing an untimely but properly completed Form 8886 until after the IRS had taken steps to identify the taxpayer's participation in the reportable transaction in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The failure, in whole or in part, to disclose in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.6011-4 of this chapter was due to an unintentional mistake of fact that existed despite the taxpayer's reasonable attempts to ascertain the correct facts with respect to the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer has an established history of properly disclosing other reportable transactions and complying with other tax laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The taxpayer demonstrates that the failure to include on any return or statement any information required to be disclosed under section 6011 arose from events beyond the taxpayer's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The taxpayer cooperates with the IRS by providing timely information with respect to the transaction at issue that the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) may request in consideration of the rescission request. In considering whether a taxpayer cooperates with the IRS, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will take into account whether the taxpayer meets the deadlines described in Rev. Proc. 2007-21 (2007-1 CB 613) (or successor document) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for complying with requests for additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Assessment of the penalty weighs against equity and good conscience, including whether the taxpayer demonstrates that there was reasonable cause for, and the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to, the failure to timely file or to include on any return any information required to be disclosed under section 6011. An important factor in determining reasonable cause and good faith is the extent of the taxpayer's efforts to ensure that persons who prepared the taxpayer's return were informed of the taxpayer's participation in the reportable transactions; this factor will be disregarded, however, if the persons who prepared the taxpayer's return were material advisors with respect to the reportable transaction. The presence of reasonable cause, however, will not necessarily be determinative of whether to grant rescission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Absence of favorable factors weighs against rescission. The absence of facts establishing the factors described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section weighs against granting rescission. The absence of any one of these factors, however, will not necessarily be determinative of whether to grant rescission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Factors not considered. In determining whether to grant rescission, the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's delegate) will not consider collectability of, or doubt as to liability for, the penalties (except that the Commissioner may consider doubt as to liability to the extent it is a factor in the determination of reasonable cause and good faith).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 2008, Taxpayer Z participated in a nonlisted reportable transaction for the first time. Under Sec. 1.6011-4(e)(1) of this chapter, he was required to attach a complete and proper Form 8886 to his 2008 return, due on April 15, 2009, and to file a copy of the Form 8886 with OTSA. Taxpayer Z timely filed his 2008 return but failed to attach a Form 8886 to his return or file a Form 8886 with OTSA. On June 1, 2009, Taxpayer Z discovered his error. On June 8, 2009, Taxpayer Z filed an amended return for tax year 2008 and attached a complete and proper Form 8886 that disclosed his participation in the reportable transaction. The amended return reflected no changes from the original return and explained that the sole purpose of the amended return was to correct Taxpayer Z's failure to file a Form 8886 with his original return. On June 8, 2009, Taxpayer Z also filed a copy of the complete and proper Form 8886 with OTSA. The IRS later notified Taxpayer Z that he was subject to a penalty under section 6707A because he failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of section 6011 by not attaching Form 8886 to his return for the 2008 taxable year. The IRS properly assessed the penalty under section 6707A and, on October 15, 2010, issued notice and demand. On November 1, 2010, in accordance with Rev. Proc. 2007-21, Taxpayer Z submitted a written request for rescission of the assessed penalty. The fact that Taxpayer Z filed an untimely Form 8886 shortly after discovery of his error but before the IRS first contacted him concerning his return for the 2008 taxable year will weigh heavily in favor of rescission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)--(1) In general.

Sec. 301.6708-1T  Failure to maintain list of investors in potentiallyabusive tax shelters (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">The following questions and answers issued under section 6708 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 142 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369; 98 Stat. 683), relate to the penalty for failure to maintain a list of investors in potentially abusive tax shelters.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What penalties are provided with respect to the failure properly to maintain a list of persons who acquire interests in potentially abusive tax shelters?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Any organizer (as defined in A-5 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) of a tax shelter (as defined in A-3 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) or seller (as defined in A-6 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) of interests in a tax shelter who fails to meet any requirement imposed by section 6112 regarding the requirement to maintain a list of persons who have acquired interests in a tax shelter shall pay a penalty of $50 for each investor with respect to whom there is such a failure, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. For example, if an organizer who is required to maintain a list identifying each of 100 persons who acquired interests in a tax shelter fails to maintain the list, the

organizer will be liable for a penalty of $5,000 ($50 x 100 persons), unless the organizer can show the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. As another example, if a seller is required to maintain a list identifying each of 100 persons who acquired interests in a tax shelter from the seller and fails properly to maintain such list by omitting the TIN of each person, the seller will be liable for a penalty of $5,000 ($50 x 100 persons), unless the seller can show the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: If an organizer or seller properly maintains a list, but fails to make the list available to the Internal Revenue Service upon request, will the organizer or seller be subject to a penalty?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: Yes. A penalty applies if an organizer or seller fails to meet any requirement imposed by section 6112, including the requirement, upon request, to make the list available to the Internal Revenue Service as soon as practicable, but in any event within 10 calendar days. (See A-21 of Sec. 301.6112-1T). The amount of the penalty is $50 for each person required to be on the list at the time of the request by the Internal Revenue Service. Assume, for example, that an organizer of a tax shelter properly maintains a list of 200 persons who have acquired interests in a tax shelter and that the Internal Revenue Service requests the organizer to provide the list. If the organizer fails to provide the list to the Internal Revenue Service as soon as practicable (as required by A-21 of Sec. 301.6112-1T), or in a form that enables the Internal Revenue Service to obtain the required information without undue delay or difficulty (as required by A-16 of Sec. 301.6112-1T), the organizer will be liable for a penalty of $10,000 ($50 x 200 persons), unless the organizer can show that the failure to provide the list was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: If an organizer or seller is required to maintain lists for more than one tax shelter in which the same person has acquired interests, how does the penalty apply if the organizer or seller fails to identify the person on each of the lists?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: A separate $50 penalty applies with respect to the list for each tax shelter on which the person who acquired interests is not identified.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Is there a limitation on the amount of the penalty imposed on a seller or organizer required to maintain a list of persons who have acquired interests in a tax shelter?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Yes. The maximum penalty that may be imposed on a person for any calendar year may not exceed $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: How does the calendar year limitation apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: A separate $50,000 limitation applies to each calendar year in which a failure occurs, and to each tax shelter for which a list is required to be maintained. See A-6 of this section for special rules for determining how the $50,000 limitation applies to a designated person who fails properly to maintain a list of investors.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that A, an organizer of a tax shelter, fails to maintain and to provide to the Internal Revenue Service a list of 900 persons who acquired interests in the tax shelter in 1986. In addition, assume that A again fails to maintain and to provide the list of 900 investors upon request in 1987. A is subject to a penalty of $45,000 (900 persons x $50) for each calendar year in which there is a failure to comply with the requirements of section 6112. Thus, A is subject to $45,000 in penalties for the failures to maintain and to provide the list in 1986, and $45,000 in penalties for the failures to maintain and to provide the list in 1987, unless A can show reasonable cause for the failures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that B, an organizer of Tax Shelter I, fails to provide a list of 1,500 persons who acquired interests in the tax shelter to the Internal Revenue Service upon request in 1987. Assume also that B, an organizer of Tax Shelter II, fails to provide a list of 2,000 persons who acquired interests in Tax Shelter II to the Internal Revenue Service upon request in 1987. Because the $50,000 calendar year limitation applies separately with respect to each tax shelter for which a list must be maintained, B is subject to a penalty of $50,000 for failing to provide the list for Tax Shelter I in 1987 and a $50,000 penalty for failing to provide the list for Tax Shelter II in 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: How does the penalty apply to a designated person?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: Separate penalties, each with its own $50,000 calendar year limitation, apply with respect to the portion of the list kept by the designated person in that person's capacity as organizer and

to each portion of the list kept by the designated person in that person's capacity as the designated person with respect to each organizer and seller who signed the agreement under A-12 of Sec. 301.6112-1T and for whom the designated person is responsible for complying with the requirements of section 6112.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that X, an organizer and seller, sells interests in a tax shelter directly to 750 investors in 1985. In addition, assume that A, an agent of X, negotiates for X sales of interests in the tax shelter to an additional 500 persons in 1985. If no agreement to designate X is made pursuant to A-11 of Sec. 301.6112-1T, X would be required to maintain a list of the 1,250 investors who acquired interests in the tax shelter (see paragraph (a) of A-8 of Sec. 301.6112-1T) and A would be required to maintain a list of the 500 persons who acquired interests through A (see A-10 of Sec. 301.6112-1T). If, therefore, neither X nor A complied with the requirements of section 6112 in 1985, X would be liable for $50,000 in penalties ($50 x 1,250 investors, subject to the $50,000 maximum) and A would be liable for $25,000 in penalties $50 x 500 investors). Assume, however, that X and A enter into a written agreement to designate X to maintain the list for the tax shelter. Pursuant to that agreement, A submits to X all of the required information regarding the sales to the 500 persons otherwise required to be maintained on A's list and provides the notice required by A-13 of Sec. 301.6112-1T to each person. In 1986, X fails to provide any list of investors to the Internal Revenue Service upon request. For calendar year 1986, X is liable for penalties of $50,000 in X's capacity as an organizer ($50 x 1,250 persons, subject to the $50,000 maximum). In addition, X, as the person designated to maintain the list for A, is liable for penalties of $25,000 for failing properly to maintain A's list of investors ($50 x 500 persons). A would not be liable for any penalties.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: If an organizer or seller is subject to a penalty with respect to a tax shelter under section 6708, may the organizer or seller also be liable for other fines or penalties with respect to the tax shelter?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: Yes. The penalty imposed by section 6708 is in addition to any other penalty provided by law. If, for example, an organizer of a tax shelter is subject to a penalty under section 6700 for promoting an abusive tax shelter, the organizer also would be liable for any applicable penalties for failing properly to maintain a list for the tax shelter. Similarly, if an organizer or seller fails to furnish a list upon request by the Internal Revenue Service, the organizer or seller may be subject both to the fine under section 7203 for the willful failure to supply information, and to the penalty for failing properly to maintain a list for the tax shelter.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: When is the penalty under section 6708 effective?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: The penalty under section 6708 applies with respect to any interest in a tax shelter which is required to be included on a list under section 6112. See A-22 of Sec. 301.6112-1T.
