                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for registration. States shall require all  applicants for registration to submit the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and address of the applicant and any other person whose  name will appear on the labeling or in the directions for use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the pesticide product, and, if the application is  for an amendment to a federally registered product, the EPA registration  number of that product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of proposed labeling, including all claims made for the  product as well as directions for its use to meet the special local  need, consisting of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a new product, a copy of the complete proposed labeling; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an additional use of a federally registered product, a copy  of proposed supplemental labeling and a copy of the labeling for the  federally registered product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The complete formula of the product, if the application is for a  new product registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other information which is required to be reviewed prior to  registration under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special local need determination. In reviewing any application  for registration, the State shall determine whether there is a special  local need for the registration. Situations which a State may consider  as not involving a special local need may include, but are not limited  to, applications for registrations to control a pest problem present on  a nationwide basis, or for use of a pesticide product registered by  other   States on an interregional or nationwide basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unreasonable adverse effects determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to issuing  a registration in the following cases, the State shall determine that  use of the product for which registration is sought will not cause  unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment, when used in  accordance with labeling directions or widespread and commonly  recognized practices:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For use of a product which has a composition not similar to any  federally registered product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For use of a project involving a use pattern not similar to any  federally registered use of the same product or of a product with a  similar composition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For use of a product for which other uses of the same product,  or of a product with a similar composition, have had registration  denied, disapproved, suspended, or cancelled by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determinations required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section  shall be based on data and criteria consistent with those sections of  part 152 of this chapter, applicable to the type of product or use under  consideration. Such determinations may also involve consideration of the  effect of the anticipated classification of the product or use under  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Efficacy determination. Prior to registration of any use of a  product for public health purposes--that is, a use which could result in  substantial harm to the public health if the product does not perform  its intended function, the State shall determine that the product  warrants the claims made for it in the registration application. Such  determinations shall be based on criteria specified in applicable  sections of part 152 of this chapter and on any additional criteria  established by the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Labeling requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to issuing any registration,  the State shall review the proposed labeling submitted with the  application to determine compliance with this paragraph. In addition,  the State shall review a copy of the final printed labeling as soon as  practical after a registration is issued in order to verify compliance  with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a new product, the State must, as a condition of the  registration, require that the product be accompanied from the time it  enters the stream of commerce by labeling meeting all applicable  criteria of Sec. 156.10 of this chapter. New product labeling must all  contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement identifying the State where registration is to be  valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The special local need registration number assigned by the  State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, as a  condition for a registration of an additional use of a federally  registered product, the State must require that at the time of sale to  users, labeling from the federally registered product be accompanied by  supplemental labeling which contains:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement identifying the State where registration is valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Directions for use to meet the special local need which satisfy  the criteria of Sec. 156.10(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The trade name of the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The name and address of the section 24(c) registrant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The EPA registration number of the federally registered product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The special local need registration number assigned by the  State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A statement prohibiting use of the product in a manner  inconsistent with all applicable directions, restrictions, and  precautions found in the labeling of the federally registered product  and accompanying supplemental labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a federally registered product is already in the stream of  commerce at the time the State issues a registration for an additional  use of that product, the State must ensure that supplemental labeling  for the additional use, meeting the criteria of paragraph (e)(3) of this  section, is made available to purchasers and users of the product within  45 days of the date on which the State approves the final printed  supplemental labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a State classifies for restricted use a product or use  registered by the State, which is not required to be so classified by  paragraph (g) of this section, then the State may require supplemental  labeling for the product or   use containing additional appropriate precautions, and a statement that  the product or use is for restricted use within that State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Packaging and coloration standards. All products registered by a  State must meet all appropriate packaging standards prescribed by the  Administrator under sec. 25(c)(3) of FIFRA. State registered products  must also meet all appropriate standards for coloration, or  discoloration, established by regulation under sec. 25(c) of FIFRA,  including the standards contained in subpart H of part 153 of this  chapter. Prior to issuing any registration, the State shall determine  that the product will conform to these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Classification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As part of the registration of any product  or use, a State shall classify the product or use as a restricted use  pesticide if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The product is identical or similar in composition to a  federally registered product:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For which all federally registered uses have been classified as  restricted by the Administrator; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For which a use similar to the State registered use has been  classified as restricted by the Administrator; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State registered product or use meets the criteria for  classification as a restricted use pesticide under the applicable  provisions of Sec. 152.170 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notification and submission of data. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within ten working days  from the date a State issues, amends, or revokes a registration, the  State shall notify EPA, in writing, of the action. Notification of State  registrations, or amendments thereto, shall include the effective date  of the registration or amendment, a confidential statement of the  formula of any new product, and a copy of the draft labeling reviewed  and approved by the State, provided that labeling previously approved by  the Administrator as part of a federal registration need not be  submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification of State registrations or amendments shall be  supplemented by the State sending to EPA a copy of the final printed  labeling approved by the State within 60 days after the effective date  of the registration or amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of revocation of a registration by a State shall  indicate the effective date of revocation, and shall state the reasons  for revocation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator or his designee may request, when appropriate,  that a State submit to EPA any data used by the State to determine that  unreasonable adverse effects will not be caused when the State registers  any use described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Within 15 working  days of receipt of such a request from EPA, the State shall submit two  copies of the requested data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Federal Register publication. The Administrator shall publish in  the Federal Register, on a regular basis, a summary of all State  registrations made under sec. 24(c) during a previous reporting period  established by the Administrator. For each product or use registered,  the notice shall indicate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the registrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The registered use(s) of the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effective date of the State registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the registration is for an additional use of a federally  registered product, whether the State registration involves a changed  use pattern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Electronic reporting under State registration of pesticide  products for special local needs. States that choose to receive  electronic documents under the regulations pertaining to state  registration of pesticides to meet special local needs, must ensure that  the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3--(Electronic reporting) are satisfied  by their state procedures for such registrations.
