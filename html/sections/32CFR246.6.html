NAF funds of the S&S; shall be used for such contracts. The audits will be performance audits and may be financial in nature as prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States Government Auditing Standards. Each annual audit will determine whether prior audit recommendations have been implemented and the reasons any have not been implemented. When the Inspector General, DoD, elects to perform an audit of the S&S; organization, such audit may substitute for the required annual audit. The S&S; organizations shall coordinate their audit requirements with each other and the Army Community and Family Support Center to the maximum extent practicable to avoid duplication of costs and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of these audits. Information copies of the audit contractor reports shall be forwarded by the S&S; to the Unified Commands, AFIS and AAA. The S&S; shall provide a response to the audit to the Unified Command CINC within 60 days of receiving the completed report. The S&S; response to the audit must indicate a concurrence or nonconcurrence for each finding and recommendation. For each concurrence the corrective actions taken or planned should be described and completion dates for actions already taken, as well as the estimated dates for completion of planned actions, should be provided. For each

nonconcurrence, specific reasons must be stated. If appropriate, alternative methods for accomplishing desired improvements may be proposed. If nonconcurrences in the findings and recommendations cannot be resolved between the S&S; management and the auditors or AAA endorses the contractors' findings and recommendations, then the resolution procedures established by DoD Directive 7650.3 \8\, and Army Regulations should be followed. The Unified Command shall forward the response to the Director of the AFIS and the AAA.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 246.4(c).</p><p class="depth3">\8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 246.4(c).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
