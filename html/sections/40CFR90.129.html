                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The permeation standards of this section apply to certain new handheld engines and equipment with respect to fuel tanks. For the purposes of this section, fuel tanks do not include fuel caps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emission standards and related requirements. (1) New handheld engines and equipment with a date of manufacture of January 1, 2009 or later that run on a volatile liquid fuel (such as gasoline) and have been certified to meet applicable fuel tank permeation standards in California must meet one of the following emission standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New handheld engines and equipment with a date of manufacture of January 1, 2009 or later that run on a volatile liquid fuel (such as gasoline) and have been certified to meet applicable fuel tank permeation standards in California must meet one of the following emission standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engines and equipment must use only fuel tanks that meet a permeation emission standard of 2.0 g/m2/day when measured according to the applicable test procedure specified by the California Air Resources Board.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engines and equipment must use only fuel tanks that meet the fuel tank permeation standards in 40 CFR 1060.103.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engines and equipment must use only fuel tanks that meet standards that apply for these engines in California for the same model year. This may involve SHED-based measurements for equipment or testing with fuel tanks alone. If this involves SHED-based measurements, all elements of the emission-control system must remain in place for fully assembled engines and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engine and equipment manufacturers may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with the requirements of this section under the averaging program as described in 40 CFR part 1054, subpart H.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The emission standards in this section apply over a useful life of two years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equipment must be labeled in a permanent and legible manner with one of the following approaches:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By meeting the labeling requirements that apply for equipment in California.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By identifying the certificate holder's corporate name or trademark, or the fuel tank manufacturer's corporate name or trademark. Also include the family number identifying compliance with California standards or state: ``THIS FUEL TANK COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA STANDARDS.'' This label may be applied to the fuel tank or it may be combined with the emission control information label required in Sec. 90.114. If the label information is not on the fuel tank, the label must include a part identification number that is also permanently applied to the fuel tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The requirements of this section do not apply to engines or equipment with structurally integrated nylon fuel tanks (as defined in 40 CFR 1054.801).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification requirements. Fuel tanks subject to the requirements in this section must be covered by a certificate of conformity. Fuel tank manufacturers or equipment manufacturers may apply for certification. Certification under this section must be based on emission data using the appropriate procedures that demonstrate compliance with the standard. You may satisfy this requirement by presenting an approved Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board showing that the fuel tanks meet the applicable standards in California. This may include an Executive Order from the previous model year for cases where new certification based on carryover of emission data from the previous model year is pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibitions. Introducing equipment into U.S. commerce without meeting all the requirements of this section violates Sec. 90.1003(a)(1).
