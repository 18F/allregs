                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A child is classified as health impaired who has limited  strength, vitality or alertness due to a chronic or acute health problem  which adversely affects learning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The health impairment classification may include, but is not  limited to, cancer, some neurological disorders, rheumatic fever, severe  asthma, uncontrolled seizure disorders, heart conditions, lead  poisoning, diabetes, AIDS, blood disorders, including hemophilia, sickle  cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, heart disease and attention deficit  disorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This category includes medically fragile children such as  ventilator dependent children who are in need of special education and  related services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A child may be classified as having an attention deficit  disorder under this category who has chronic and pervasive  developmentally inappropriate inattention, hyperactivity, or  impulsivity. To be considered a disorder, this behavior must affect the  child's functioning severely. To avoid overuse of this category,  grantees are cautioned to assure that only the enrolled children who  most severely manifest this behavior must be classified in this  category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The condition must severely affect the performance of a child  who is trying to carry out a developmentally appropriate activity that  requires orienting, focusing, or maintaining attention during classroom  instructions and activities, planning and completing activities,  following simple directions, organizing materials for play or other  activities, or participating in group activities. It also may be  manifested in overactivity or impulsive acts which appear to be or are  interpreted as physical aggression. The disorder must manifest itself in  at least two different settings, one of which must be the Head Start  program site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Children must not be classified as having attention deficit  disorders based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Temporary problems in attention due to events such as a divorce,  death of a family member or post-traumatic stress reactions to events  such as sexual abuse or violence in the neighborhood;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Problems in attention which occur suddenly and acutely with  psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Behaviors which may be caused by frustration stemming from  inappropriate programming beyond the child's ability level or by  developmentally inappropriate demands for long periods of inactive,  passive activity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Intentional noncompliance or opposition to reasonable requests  that are typical of good preschool programs; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Inattention due to cultural or language differences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An attention deficit disorder must have had its onset in early  childhood and have persisted through the course of child development  when children normally mature and become able to operate in a socialized  preschool environment. Because many children younger than four have  difficulty orienting, maintaining and focussing attention and are highly  active, when Head Start is responsible for the evaluation, attention  deficit disorder applies to four and five year old children in Head  Start but not to three year olds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assessment procedures must include teacher reports which  document the frequency and nature of indications of possible attention  deficit disorders and describe the specific situations and events  occurring just before the problems manifested themselves. Reports must  indicate how the child's functioning was impaired and must be confirmed  by independent information from a second observer.</p>
