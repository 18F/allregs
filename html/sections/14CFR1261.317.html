In  these roles, agency attorneys undertake a full and traditional attorney- client relationship with the employee with respect to application of the  attorney-client privilege. If representation is authorized, National  Aeronautics and Space Administration attorneys who assist in the  representation of a present or former employee also undertake a full and  traditional attorney-client relationship with that employee with respect  to the attorney-client privilege.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any adverse information communicated by the client-employee to  an agency attorney during the course of such attorney-client  relationship shall not be disclosed to anyone, either inside or outside  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, other than attorneys  resonsible for representation of the employee, unless such disclosure is  authorized by the employee. Such adverse information shall continue to  be fully protected whether or not representation is provided and even  though representation may be denied or discontinued.
