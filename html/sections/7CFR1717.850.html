                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This subpart R establishes policies  and procedures for the accommodation, subordination or release of the  Government's lien on borrower assets, including approvals of supporting  documents and related loan security documents, in connection with 100  percent private sector financing of facilities and other purposes.  Policies and procedures regarding lien accommodations for concurrent  supplemental financing required in connection with an RUS insured loan  are set forth in subpart S of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This subpart and subpart S of this part apply only to debt to be  secured under the mortgage, the issuance of which is subject to the  approval of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) by the terms of the  borrower's mortgage with respect to the issuance of additional debt or  the refinancing or refunding of debt. If RUS approval is not required  under such terms of the mortgage itself, a lien accommodation is not  required. If the loan contract or other agreement between the borrower  and RUS requires RUS approval with respect to the issuance of debt or  making additions to or extensions of the borrower's system, such  required approvals do not by themselves result in the need for a lien  accommodation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overall policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with prudent lending practices,  the maintenance of adequate security for RUS's loans, and the objectives  of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act), it is the policy of RUS to  provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in obtaining  financing from other lenders by sharing RUS's lien on a borrower's  assets in order to finance electric facilities, equipment and systems,  and certain other types of community infrastructure. In certain  circumstances, RUS may facilitate the financing of such assets by  subordinating its lien on specific assets financed by other lenders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is also the policy of RUS to provide effective and timely  assistance to borrowers in promoting rural development by subordinating  RUS's lien for financially sound rural development investments under the  conditions set forth in Sec. 1717.858.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decision factors. In determining whether to accommodate,  subordinate, or release its lien on property pledged by the borrower  under the RUS mortgage, RUS will consider the effects of such action on  the achievement of the purposes of the RE Act, the repayment and  security of RUS loans secured by the mortgage, and other factors set  forth in this subpart. The following factors will be considered in  assessing the effects on the repayment and security of RUS loans:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The value of the added assets compared with the amount of new  debt to be secured;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of the assets already pledged under the mortgage, and  any effects of the proposed transaction on the value of those assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ratio of the total outstanding debt secured under the  mortgage to the value of all assets pledged as security under the  mortgage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The borrower's ability to repay debt owed to the Government, as  indicated by the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Revenues, costs (including interest, lease payments and other  debt service costs), margins, Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER), Debt  Service Coverage (DSC), and other case-specific economic and financial  factors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The variability and uncertainty of future revenues, costs,  margins, TIER, DSC, and other case-specific economic and financial  factors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Future capital needs and the ability of the borrower to meet  those needs at reasonable cost;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The ability of the borrower's management to manage and control  its system effectively and plan for future needs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other factors that may be relevant in individual cases, as  determined by RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Environmental considerations. Under certain circumstances, such  as when the project does not qualify for a categorical exclusion, the  environmental requirements of 7 CFR part 1794 may apply to applications  for lien accommodations, subordinations, and releases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Co-mortgagees. Other mortgagees under existing mortgages shared  with RUS may have the right to approve requests for lien accommodations,  subordinations and releases. In those cases, borrowers would have to  obtain the approval of such mortgagees in order for the lien of the  mortgage to be accommodated, subordinated or released. Any reference in  this subpart to waiving by RUS of any of its rights under the mortgage  shall apply only to the rights of RUS and shall not apply to the rights  of any other co-mortgagee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Safety and performance standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for a lien  accommodation or subordination from RUS, a borrower must comply with RUS  standards regarding facility and system planning and design,  construction, procurement, and the use of materials accepted by RUS, as  required by the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other agreement  with RUS, and as further specified in RUS regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RUS ``Buy American'' requirements shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Advance of funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The advance of funds from 100 percent  private loans lien accommodated or subordinated by RUS will not be  subject to RUS approval. It is the private lender's responsibility to  adopt reasonable measures to ensure that such loan funds are used for  the purposes for which the loan was made and the lien accommodation or  subordination granted. RUS encourages lenders to adopt the following  measures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remit loan advances to a separate subaccount of the Cash- Construction Fund-Trustee Account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain a certification from a registered professional engineer,  for each year during which funds from the separate subaccount are  utilized by the borrower, that all materials and equipment purchased and  facilities constructed during the year from said funds comply with RUS  safety and performance standards, as required by paragraph (f) of this  section, and are included in an CWP or CWP amendment approved by the  borrower's board of directors;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Obtain an auditor's certification from a Certified Public  Accountant, for each year during which funds are advanced to or remitted  from the separate subaccount, certifying:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of loan funds advanced to and remitted from the  separate subaccount during the period of review;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That based on the auditor's review of construction work orders  and other records, all moneys disbursed from the separate subaccount  during the period of review were used for purposes contemplated in the  loan agreement and the lien accommodation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Immediately notify RUS in writing if the lender is unable to  obtain the certifications cited in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The measures listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section will  normally be sufficient to meet the lender's responsibility provided that  additional measures are not reasonably required based on the particular  circumstances of an individual case. Should a lender fail to carry out  its responsibility in the manner described in this paragraph (g) or in  another manner acceptable to RUS, RUS may disqualify such lender from  participation in advance approval under Sec. Sec. 1717.854 and 1717.857  and condition the lender's receipt of a lien accommodation or  subordination upon the lender providing satisfactory evidence that it  will fulfill its responsibility under this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contracting and procurement procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities financed  with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS sources, without an RUS loan  guarantee, are not subject to RUS post-loan requirements regarding  contracting, procurement and bidding procedures; contract close-out  procedures pertaining to project completion, final payment of  contractor, and related matters; and standard forms of construction and  procurement contracts listed in 7 CFR 1726.300.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent that provisions in a borrower's loan contract or  mortgage in favor of RUS may be inconsistent with paragraphs (g)(1) and  (h)(1) of this section, paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section are  intended to constitute an approval or waiver under the terms of such  instruments, and in any regulations implementing such instruments, with  respect to facilities financed with debt obtained entirely from non-RUS  sources without an RUS guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Access of handicapped to buildings and seismic safety. A  borrower must meet the following requirements to be eligible for a lien  accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing of the  construction of buildings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower must provide RUS with a certification by the  project architect that the buildings will be designed and constructed in  compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended  (29 U.S.C. 794), as applicable under that Act, and that the facilities  will be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps in  accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS),  (Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101.19, subpart 101-19.6). The certification  must be included in the borrower's application for a lien accommodation  or subordination. In addition to these requirements, building  construction may also be subject to requirements of The Americans with  Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The borrower must comply with RUS's seismic safety requirements  set forth in 7 CFR part 1792, subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Breach of warranty. Any breach of any warranty or agreement or  any material inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, certificate,  document, or opinion submitted pursuant to this subpart, including,  without limitation, any agreement or representation regarding the use of  funds from loans lien accommodated or subordinated pursuant to this  subpart, shall constitute a default by the borrower under the terms of  its loan agreement with RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Guaranteed loans. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to  lien accommodations or subordinations sought for loans guaranteed by  RUS. Such lien accommodations and subordinations are governed by RUS  regulations on guaranteed loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Release of lien. To avoid repetition, release of lien is not  mentioned in every instance where it may be an acceptable alternative to  subordination of RUS's lien. Generally, lien subordination is favored  over release of lien, and any decision to release RUS's lien is at the  sole discretion of RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Waiver authority. Consistent with the RE Act and other  applicable laws, any requirement, condition, or restriction imposed by  this subpart, or subpart S of this part, on a borrower, private lender,  or application for a lien accommodation or subordination may be waived  or reduced by the Administrator, if the Administrator determines that  said action is in the Government's financial interest with respect to  ensuring repayment and reasonably adequate security for loans made or  guaranteed by RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Liability. It is the intent of this subpart that any failure on  the part of RUS to comply with any provisions hereof, including without  limitation, those provisions setting forth specified timeframes for  action by RUS on applications for lien accommodations or lien  subordinations, shall not give rise to liability of any kind on the part  of the Government or any employees of the Government including, without  limitation, liability for damages, fees, expenses or costs incurred by  or on behalf of a borrower, private lender or any other party.
