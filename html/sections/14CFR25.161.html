Each airplane must meet the trim requirements of this section after being trimmed, and without further pressure upon, or movement of, either the primary controls or their corresponding trim controls by the pilot or the automatic pilot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lateral and directional trim. The airplane must maintain lateral and directional trim with the most adverse lateral displacement of the center of gravity within the relevant operating limitations, during normally expected conditions of operation (including operation at any speed from 1.3 VSR1 to VMO/MMO).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Longitudinal trim.
