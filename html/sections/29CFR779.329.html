                                Sec. 779.329  Effect of type of customer and type of goods or services.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In some industries the type of goods or services sold or the type of  purchaser of goods or services are determining factors in whether a sale  or service is recognized as retail in the particular industry. In other  industries a sale or service may be recognized as retail regardless of  the type of goods or services sold or the type of customer. Where a sale  is recognized as retail regardless of the type of customer, its  character as such will not be affected by the character of the customer,  with reference to whether he is a private individual or a business  concern, or by the use the purchaser makes of the purchased commodity.  For example, if the sale of a single automobile to anyone for any  purpose is recognized as a retail sale in the industry, it will be  considered as a retail sale for purposes of the exemption whether the  customer be a private individual or an industrial concern or whether the  automobile is used by the purchaser for pleasure purposes or for  business purposes. If a sale of a particular quantity of coal is  recognized in the industry as a retail sale, its character as such will  not be affected by the fact that it is sold for the purpose of heating  an office building as distinguished from a private dwelling. If the  repair of a wash basin is recognized in the industry as a retail  service, its character as such will not be affected by the fact that it  is a wash basin in a factory building as distinguished from a wash basin  in a private dwelling house. It must be remembered that these principles  apply only to those sales of goods or services which have a retail  concept, that is, where the subject matter is ``retailable.'' See Sec.  779.321. The ``industry-recognition'' question as to whether such sales  are recognized as retail in the industry has no relevancy if in fact the  goods and services sold are not of a ``retailable'' character, as  previously explained. If the subject of the sale does not come within  the concept of retailable items contemplated by the statute, there can  be no recognition in any industry of the sale of the goods or services  as retail, for purposes of the Act, even though the nomenclature used by  the industry members may put a retail label on the transaction. (See  Wirtz v. Steepleton General Tire Co., 383 U.S. 190; Mitchell v. Kentucky  Finance Co., 359 U.S. 290.)</p><p class="depth0">Sales Not Made for Resale</p>
