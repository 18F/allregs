                                Sec. 33.405  How does a recipient determine its fair share objectives?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A recipient must determine its fair share objectives based on demonstrable evidence of the number of certified MBEs and WBEs that are ready, willing, and able to perform in the relevant geographic market for each of the four procurement categories (equipment, construction, services, and supplies). The relevant geographic market is the area of solicitation for the procurement as determined by the recipient. The market may be a geographic region of a State, an entire State, or a multi-State area. Fair share objectives must reflect the recipient's determination of the level of MBE and WBE participation it would expect absent the effects of discrimination. A recipient may combine the four procurement categories into one weighted objective for MBEs and one weighted objective for WBEs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Step 1. A recipient must first determine a base figure for the relative availability of MBEs and WBEs. The following are examples of approaches that a recipient may take. Any percentage figure derived from one of these examples should be considered a basis from which a recipient begins when examining evidence available in its jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> MBE and WBE Directories and Census Bureau Data. Separately determine the number of certified MBEs and WBEs that are ready, willing, and able to perform in the relevant geographic market for each procurement category from a MBE/WBE directory, such as a bidder's list. Using the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern (CBP) database, determine the number of all qualified businesses available in the market that perform work in the same procurement category. Separately divide the number of MBEs and WBEs by the number of all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of MBEs and WBEs in the market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data from a Disparity Study. Use a percentage figure derived from data in

a valid, applicable disparity study conducted within the preceding ten years comparing the available MBEs and WBEs in the relevant geographic market with their actual usage by entities procuring in the categories of construction, equipment, services, and supplies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Objective of Another EPA Recipient. A recipient may use, as its base figure, the fair share objectives of another EPA recipient if the recipient demonstrates that it will use the same, or substantially similar, relevant geographic market as the other EPA recipient. (See Sec. 33.411 for exemptions from fair share objective negotiations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alternative Methods. Subject to EPA approval, other methods may be used to determine a base figure for the overall objective. Any methodology chosen must be based on demonstrable evidence of local market conditions and be designed to ultimately attain an objective that is rationally related to the relative availability of MBEs and WBEs in the relevant geographic market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Step 2. After calculating a base figure, a recipient must examine the evidence available in its jurisdiction to determine what adjustment, if any, is needed to the base figure in order to arrive at the fair share objective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are many types of evidence that must be considered when adjusting the base figure. These include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The current capacity of MBEs and WBEs to perform contract work under EPA financial assistance agreements, as measured by the volume of work MBEs and WBEs have performed in recent years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence from disparity studies conducted anywhere within the recipient's jurisdiction, to the extent it is not already accounted for in the base figure; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the base figure is the objective of another EPA recipient, it must be adjusted for differences in the local market and the recipient's contracting program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A recipient may also consider available evidence from related fields that affect the opportunities for MBEs and WBEs to form, grow and compete. These include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statistical disparities in the ability of MBEs and WBEs to get the financing, bonding and insurance required to participate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data on employment, self-employment, education, training and union apprenticeship programs, to the extent it can be related to the opportunities for MBEs and WBEs to perform in the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a recipient attempts to make an adjustment to its base figure to account for the continuing effects of past discrimination (often called the ``but for'' factor) or the effects of another ongoing MBE/WBE program, the adjustment must be based on demonstrable evidence that is logically and directly related to the effect for which the adjustment is sought.</p>
