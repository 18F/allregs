                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (12 CFR part 225, appendix C) (Policy Statement) applies to savings and loan holding companies as if they were bank

holding companies. To qualify or rely on the Policy Statement, savings and loan holding companies must meet all qualifying requirements in the Policy Statement as if they were a bank holding company. For purposes of applying the Policy Statement, the term ``nonbank subsidiary'' as used in the Policy Statement refers to a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company other than a savings association or a subsidiary of a savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board may exclude any savings and loan holding company, regardless of asset size, from the Policy Statement under paragraph (a) of this section if the Board determines that such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.
