                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification by employee. The employee may propose, in response to a Notice of Intent, a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to do this must submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt which is received by the Board within thirty calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Board's response. In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the Board's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the Board will balance the agency's interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, the Board will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in

undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</p>
