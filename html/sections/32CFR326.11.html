                            <p class="depth0">When requested medical and psychological records are not exempt from disclosure, the PA Coordinator may determine which non-exempt medical or psychological records should not be sent directly to the requester because of possible harm or adverse impact to the requester or another person. In that event, the information may be disclosed to a physician named by the requester. The appointment of the physician will be in the same notarized form or declaration as described in Sec. 326.8 and will certify that the physician is licensed to practice in the appropriate specialty (medicine, psychology, or psychiatry). Upon designation, verification of the physician's identity, and agreement by the physician to review the documents with the requester to explain the meaning of the documents and to offer counseling designed to mitigate any adverse reaction, the NRO will forward such records to the designated physician. If the requester refuses or fails to designate a physician, the record shall not be provided. Under such circumstances refusal of access is not considered a denial for Privacy Act reporting purposes. However, if the designated physician declines to furnish the records to the individual, the PA Coordinator will take action to ensure that the records are provided to the individual.</p>
