The DoD Components:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Comply with the specific governing statute for the type of property and ensure the limitations of the governing statute are observed. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2572 and DoD issuances, the Secretary of a Military Department or the Secretary of the Treasury is permitted to donate, lend, or exchange, as applicable, without expense to the United States, books, manuscripts, works of art, historical artifacts, drawings, plans, models and condemned or obsolete combat materiel that are not needed by the Military Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establish supplementary procedures governing loans, donations, and exchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> May donate, loan or exchange items as identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if the special donation, loan, or exchange action occurs prior to transfer to DLA Disposition Services for disposition.

The Secretary concerned may waive this limitation in the case of an exchange for property in which the Secretary determines the item to be received by the United States will significantly enhance the historical collection of the property administered by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Will not incur costs in connection with loans or gifts. However, the DoD Component concerned may, without cost to the recipient, DEMIL, prepare, and transport within the CONUS items authorized for donation to a recognized war veterans' association in accordance with DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3 if the DoD Component determines this can be accomplished as a training mission, without additional expenditures for the unit involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Will maintain official records of all DoD materiel loaned including physical inventory, record reconciliation, and management reporting specified in the inventory management procedures in DoD Manual 4140.01, ``DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures'' (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414001m/414001m_vol01.pdf). Verify yearly that property is being used for approved purposes, is being maintained and protected according to the agreement, and that the recipient organization still desires to retain the property. The DoD Component may perform this annual check by any method that provides reasonable assurance the recipient organization is fulfilling its responsibilities. DoD Components may request assistance from qualified DoD organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Organizations authorized to receive loans and donations. (i) A municipal corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A soldiers' monument association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An incorporated museum or memorial that is operated by a historical society, a historical institution of a State or foreign nation, or a nonprofit military aviation heritage foundation or association incorporated in a State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An incorporated museum that is operated and maintained for educational purposes only and the charter of which denies it the right to operate for profit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States or the American Legion or a unit of any other recognized war veterans' association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A local or national unit of any war veterans' association of a foreign nation recognized by the national government of that nation (or by the government of one of the principal political subdivisions of that nation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A post of the Sons of Veterans Reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirements for veterans' organizations. To qualify, veterans' organizations must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sponsored by a Military Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evaluated based on its size, purpose, the type and scope of services it renders to veterans, and composed of honorably discharged American soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, or coastguardsmen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirements for museums. To qualify, museums must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Meet State (or equivalent foreign national) criteria for not-for-profit museums.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Have an existing facility suitable for the display and protection of the type of property desired for loan or donation. If the requester has a facility under construction that will meet those requirements, interim eligibility may be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Have a professional staff that can care for and accept responsibility for the loaned or donated property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Have assets that, in the determination of the loaning or donating service, indicate the capability of the loaner and the borrower to provide the required care and security of historical property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Eligibility determination. The DoD Components will determine the eligibility of organizations for gifts and loans. The DoD Components may establish eligibility requirements dependent upon the unique nature of the specific historical item; however, the minimum requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limit donations, loans, or exchanges to property stipulated by 10 U.S.C. 2557, 2572, 2576, and 2576a. Except for relevant records for aircraft and associated engines and equipment (unless authorized under DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3 and DoD Instruction 2030.08), government records may not be released.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approve the loan, donation, or exchange; process requests for variations from the original agreement; and maintain official records of all donation, loan, and exchange agreements. The approval of exchanges may be delegated at the discretion of the Secretary concerned, and is encouraged for low-dollar transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Establish controls for determining compliance by the recipient organization with the display, security, and usage criteria provided in the loan and donation agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide disposition instructions to the recipient organization when loaned or donated property is no longer needed or authorized for continued use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Establish conditions for making donations, loans, or exchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Establish a process (e.g., a council or other means suitable to the loan and donation organization) to review and approve proposed exchanges incorporating legal and financial review independent of the museum involved. Personnel directly involved in museum operations will not act as sole approving authority for any exchange transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Ensure that correspondence regarding loans, donations, or exchanges is signed by individuals authorized to obligate their organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Ensure appropriate DEMIL of the property as prescribed in DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3 before release. If standard DEMIL criteria cannot be applied without destroying the display value, specific DEMIL actions (such as aircraft structural cuts) may be delayed. The recipient organization must agree to assume responsibility for the property DEMIL action, at no cost to the Government, when the item is no longer desired or authorized for display purposes. The recipient organization may also return the property to the Government via the donating Military Department for full DEMIL action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Loan, donate, or exchange property on an ``as is, where is'' basis and ensure that the recipient organization agrees to pay all costs incident to preparation, handling, and movement of the property.
