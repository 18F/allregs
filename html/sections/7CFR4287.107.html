                            <p class="depth0">The lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and for taking all servicing actions that a prudent lender would perform in servicing its own

portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The Loan Note Guarantee is unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, use of loan funds for unauthorized purposes, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security interest regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. This responsibility includes but is not limited to the collection of payments, obtaining compliance with the covenants and provisions in the Loan Agreement, obtaining and analyzing financial statements, checking on payment of taxes and insurance premiums, and maintaining liens on collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lender reports and annual renewal fee. The lender must report the outstanding principal and interest balance on each guaranteed loan semiannually using a USDA-approved status report or other approved format. The lender will transmit the annual renewal fee to the Agency simultaneously with the December 31 semiannual status report in accordance with 7 CFR part 4279, subpart B, Sec. 4279.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan classification. Within 90 days of receipt of the Loan Note Guarantee, the lender must notify the Agency of the loan's classification or rating under its regulatory standards. Should the classification be changed at a future time, the Agency must be notified immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency and lender conference. At the Agency's request, the lender will meet with the Agency to ascertain how the guaranteed loan is being serviced and that the conditions and covenants of the Loan Agreement are being enforced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financial reports. The lender must obtain and forward to the Agency the financial statements required by the Loan Agreement. The lender must submit annual financial statements to the Agency within 120 days of the end of the borrower's fiscal year. The lender must analyze the financial statements and provide the Agency with a written summary of the lender's analysis and conclusions, including trends, strengths, weaknesses, extraordinary transactions, and other indications of the financial condition of the borrower. Spreadsheets of the new financial statements must be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional expenditures. The lender will not make additional loans to the borrower without first obtaining the prior written approval of the Agency, even though such loans will not be guaranteed.
