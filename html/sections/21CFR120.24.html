For the purposes of this regulation, the  ``pertinent microorganism'' is the most resistant microorganism of  public health significance that is likely to occur in the juice. The  following juice processors are exempt from this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A juice processor that is subject to the requirements of part  113 or part 114 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A juice processor using a single thermal processing step  sufficient to achieve shelf-stability of the juice or a thermal  concentration process that includes thermal treatment of all  ingredients, provided that the processor includes a copy of the thermal  process used to achieve shelf-stability or concentration in its written  hazard analysis required by Sec. 120.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All juice processors shall meet the requirements of paragraph  (a) of this section through treatments that are applied directly to the  juice, except that citrus juice processors may use treatments to fruit  surfaces, provided that the 5-log reduction process begins after culling  and cleaning as defined in Sec. 120.3(a) and (f) and the reduction is  accomplished within a single production facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All juice processors shall meet the requirements of paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this section and perform final product packaging within a  single production facility operating under current good manufacturing  practices. Processors claiming an exemption under paragraph (a)(1) or  (a)(2) of this section shall also process and perform final product  packaging of all juice subject to the claimed exemption within a single  production facility operating under current good manufacturing  practices.</p>
