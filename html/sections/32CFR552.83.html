                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No finance charge contracted for, made, or received under any  contract shall be in excess of the charge which could be made for such  contract under the law of the place in which the contract is signed in  the United States by the serviceman. In the event a contract is signed  with a United States company in a foreign country, the lowest interest  rate of the state or states in which the company is chartered or does  business shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No contract or loan agreement shall provide for an attorney's  fee in the event of default unless suit is filed in which event the fee  provided in the contract shall not exceed 20 percent of the obligation  found due. No attorney's fees shall be authorized if he is a salaried  employee of the holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In loan transactions, defenses which the debtor may have against  the original lender or its agent shall be good against any subsequent  holder of the obligation. In credit transactions, defenses against the  seller or its agent shall be good against any subsequent holder of the  obligation provided that the holder had actual knowledge of the defense  or under condition where reasonable inquiry would have apprised him of  this fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The debtor shall have the right to remove any security for the  obligation beyond State or national boundaries if he or his family moves  beyond such boundaries under military orders and notifies the creditor,  in advance of the removal, of the new address where the security will be  located. Removal of the security shall not accelerate payment of the  obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No late charge shall be made in excess of 5 percent of the late  payment, or $5 whichever is the lesser amount. Only one late charge may  be made for any tardy installment. Late charges will not be levied where  an allotment has been timely filed, but payment of the allotment has  been delayed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The obligation may be paid in full at any time or through  accelerated payments of any amount. There shall be no penalty for  prepayment and in the event of prepayment, that portion of the finance  charges which have insured to the benefit of the seller or creditor  shall be prorated on the basis of the charges which would have been  ratably payable had finance charges been calculated and payable as equal  periodic payments over the term of the contract, and only the prorated  amount to the date of prepayment shall be due. As an alternative, the  ``Rule of 78'' may be applied, in which case its operation shall be  explained in the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No charge shall be made for an insurance premium or for finance  charges for such premium unless satisfactory evidence of a policy, or  insurance certificate where State insurance laws or regulations permit  such certificates to be issued in lieu of a policy, reflecting such  coverage has been delivered to the debtor within 30 days after the  specified date of delivery of the item purchased or the signing of a  cash loan agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the loan or contract agreement provides for payments in  installments, each payment, other than the down payment, shall be in  equal or substantially equal amounts, and installments shall be  successive and of equal or substantially equal duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> If the security for the debt is repossessed and sold in order to  satisfy or reduce the debt, the repossession and resale will meet the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> The defaulting purchaser will be given advance written notice of  the intention to repossess;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Following repossession, the defaulting purchaser will be served  a complete statement of his obligations and adequate advance notice of  the sale;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> He will be permitted to redeem the item by payment of the amount  due before the sale, or in lieu thereof submit a bid at the sale;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(4)</em> There will be a solicitation for a minimum of three sealed bids  unless sold at auction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(5)</em> The party holding the security, and all agents thereof are  ineligible to bid;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(6)</em> The defaulting purchaser will be charged only those charges  which are reasonably necessary for storage, reconditioning, and resale;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(7)</em> He shall be provided a written detailed statement of his  obligations, if any, following the resale and promptly refunded any  credit balance due him, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A contract for personal goods and services may be terminated at  any time before delivery of the goods or services without charge to the  purchaser. However, if goods made to the special order of the purchaser  result in preproduction costs, or require preparation for delivery, such  additional costs will be listed in the order form or contract. No  termination charge will be made in excess of this amount. Contracts for  delivery at future intervals may be terminated as to the undelivered  portion, and the purchaser shall be chargeable only for that proportion  of the total cost which the goods or services delivered bear to the  total goods called for by the contract. (This is in addition to the  right to rescind certain credit transactions involving a security  interest in real estate provided by section 125 of the Truth-in-Lending  Act, Pub. L. 90-321 (15 U.S.C. 1601) and Sec. 226.9 of Regulation Z (12  CFR part 226).</p>
