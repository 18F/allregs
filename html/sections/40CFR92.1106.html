The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (c) unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Collection.
