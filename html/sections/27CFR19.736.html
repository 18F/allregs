                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A proprietor that receives spirits in bond from another  alcohol fuel plant is the ``consignee'' of the shipment. When receiving  spirits in bond, the consignee must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examine each conveyance and notify the appropriate TTB officer  immediately if any of the locks, seals, or other devices that secure  each conveyance do not arrive at the premises intact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the quantity of spirits received and record the  quantity and date of receipt on the invoice or shipping document sent  with the shipment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retain the invoice or shipping document as part of the records  required by Sec. 19.718.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Portable containers. A consignee who receives spirits in  barrels, drums, or other portable containers that are not secured by  seals or other devices must verify the contents of each container. The  consignee must record the quantity received in each container on a list  and must attach the list to the invoice or shipping document received  with the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bulk conveyances or pipelines. A consignee who receives spirits  in bulk conveyances or by pipeline must gauge the spirits received and  record the quantity determined on the invoice or shipping document  received with the shipment. The appropriate TTB officer may waive the  requirement for gauging spirits received by pipeline if requested in  writing by the consignee and if there is no jeopardy to the revenue.
