                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In interpreting an applicable implementation plan (or  implementation plan submission) with respect to its motor vehicle  emissions budget(s), the MPO and DOT may not infer additions to the  budget(s) that are not explicitly intended by the implementation plan  (or submission). Unless the implementation plan explicitly quantifies  the amount by which motor vehicle emissions could be higher while still  allowing a demonstration of compliance with the milestone, attainment,  or maintenance requirement and explicitly states an intent that some or  all of this additional amount should be available to the MPO and DOT in  the emissions budget for conformity purposes, the MPO may not interpret  the budget to be higher than the implementation plan's estimate of  future emissions. This applies in particular to applicable  implementation plans (or submissions) which demonstrate that after  implementation of control measures in the implementation plan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emissions from all sources will be less than the total emissions  that would be consistent with a required demonstration of an emissions  reduction milestone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emissions from all sources will result in achieving attainment  prior to the attainment deadline and/or ambient concentrations in the  attainment deadline year will be lower than needed to demonstrate  attainment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emissions will be lower than needed to provide for continued  maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A conformity demonstration shall not trade emissions among  budgets which the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan  submission) allocates for different pollutants or precursors, or among  budgets allocated to motor vehicles and other sources, unless the  implementation plan establishes appropriate mechanisms for such trades.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan  submission) estimates future emissions by geographic subarea of the  nonattainment area, the MPO and DOT are not required to consider this to  establish subarea budgets, unless the applicable implementation plan (or  implementation plan submission) explicitly indicates an intent to create  such subarea budgets for the purposes of conformity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a nonattainment area includes more than one MPO, the  implementation plan may establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for  each MPO, or else the MPOs must collectively make a conformity  determination for the entire nonattainment area.
