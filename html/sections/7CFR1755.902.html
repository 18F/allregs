                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section is intended for cable manufacturers, Agency  borrowers, and consulting engineers. It covers the requirements for  fiber optic cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment  to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for  underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried  installations by trenching, direct plowing, and directional or pneumatic  boring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specification requirements are given in SI units  which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English  equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied  protective coatings, and are called ``fibers,'' herein. These fibers may  be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube,  encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or  ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may  complete the cable core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the  interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in  the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water  swellable elements to exclude water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic  jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under  the jacket. The jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some  designs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Buried installation requires armor under the outer jacket.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For self-supporting cable, the outer jacket may be extruded  over the support messenger and cable core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Cables for mid-span applications for network access must be  designed for easy mid-span access to the fibers. The manufacturer may  use reversing oscillating stranding (SZ) described in section 6.4 of  ITU-T Recommendation L.58, Construction, Installation and Protection of  Cables and Other Elements of Outside Plant, 2004 (incorporated by  reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)). The cable end user is cautioned that  installed cable must be properly terminated. This includes properly  securing rigid strength members (i.e., central strength member) and  clamping the cable and jacket. It is important that cable components be  secured to prevent movement of the cable or components over the  operating conditions. Central strength member (CSM) clamps must prevent  movement of the CSM; positive stop CSM clamps are recommended. The CSM  must be routed as straight and as short as practical to prevent bowing  or breaking of the CSM. The cable and jacket retention must be  sufficient to prevent jacket slippage over the operating temperature  range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The normal temperature ranges for cables must meet paragraph  1.1.3 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640, Standard for Optical Fiber Outside Plant  Communications Cable (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tensile rating. The standard installation tensile rating for  cables is 2670 N (600 1bf), unless installation involves micro type  cables that utilize less stress related methods of installation, i.e.,  blown micro-fiber cable or All-Dielectric Self-Supporting (ADSS) cables  (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> ADSS and other self-supporting cables. Based on the storm  loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading   of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007, National Electrical Safety  Code, 2007 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(b)) and the  maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end  user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension  tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular  installation. The information included must be for Rule B, Ice and Wind  Loading, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C, Extreme Wind  Loading. Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically  a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the  maximum sag under loaded conditions, as well as, height of attachment  for each application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Minimum bend diameter. For cable under loaded and unloaded  conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in  paragraph 1.1.5, Minimum Bend Diameter, of the ANSI/ICEA S-87-640  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)). For very small cables,  manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are  independent of the outside diameter. For cables having a non-circular  cross-section, the bend diameter is to be determined using the thickness  of the cable associated with the preferential bending axis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is  distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve  colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders,  threads, strippings, or markings provide fiber group identification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cables must demonstrate compliance with the qualification  testing requirements of this section to ensure satisfactory end-use  performance characteristics for the intended applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section  may be allowed if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance  of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility  and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain  Agency product acceptance, refer to the procedures listed at http:// www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing--procedures/index--listing-- procedures.htm, as well as additional information in RUS Bulletin 345-3,  Acceptance of Standards, Specifications, Equipment Contract Forms,  Manual Sections, Drawings, Materials and Equipment for the Telephone  Program (hereinafter ``RUS Bulletin 345-3''), available for download at  http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/publications/bulletins.htm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All cables sold to RUS telecommunications borrowers for projects  involving RUS loan funds must be accepted by the Agency's Technical  Standards Committee ``A'' (Telecommunications). Any design change to  existing acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for  acceptance. As stated in paragraph 8 above, refer to the procedures  listed at http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing--procedures/index-- listing--procedures.htm as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the  cables meeting the requirements of this section have characteristics  that will allow signals having a range of wavelengths to be carried  simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Optical fibers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The solid glass optical fibers must consist  of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet- cured acrylate or other suitable coating. Each fiber must be continuous  throughout its length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Zero-dispersion. Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes  of Table 2, G.652.B attributes, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.652  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)). However, when the end  user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the  fiber attributes of Table 4, G.652.D attributes, found in ITU-T  Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss  fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 7-1,  G.657 class A attributes, found in the ITU-T Recommendation G.657  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-zero-dispersion. Optical fibers must meet the fiber  attributes of Table 1, G.656 attributes, found in ITU-T Recommendation  G.656 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)). However, when the  end user specifies Recommendation A, B, C, D, or E of ITU-   T Recommendation G.655 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(f)),  the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of ITU-T  Recommendation G.655.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multimode fibers. Optical fibers must meet the requirements of  paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by  reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Matched cable. Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all  single mode fiber cables delivered to a RUS-financed project must be  manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the  requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the  maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cable meeting the requirements of this  section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of ``matched  cable,'' as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1755.900. With the use of  cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the  average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be <=0.1 dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the  cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must  be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 [micro]m with a maximum tolerance range  of [0.5 [micro]m (362 [20 microinch), unless the end user agrees to  accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the end user  does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum  tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the requirements  of paragraph (d)(5) must prevail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Factory splices are not allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Coating. The optical fiber must be coated with a suitable  material to preserve the intrinsic strength of the glass having an  outside diameter of 250 [15 micrometers (10 [0.6 mils). Dimensions must  be measured per the methods of paragraph 7.13 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)). The protective  coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other  imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with  the best commercial practice. The diameter of the fiber, as the fiber is  used in the cable, includes any coloring thickness or the uncolored  coating, as the case may be. The strip force required to remove 30 [3  millimeters (1.2 [0.1 inch) of protective fiber coating must be between  1.0 N (0.2 pound-force) and 9.0 N (2 pound-force).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the  same type, unless otherwise specified by end user.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required  by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference  at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Buffers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The optical fibers contained in a tube buffer  (loose tube), an inner jacket (unit core), a channel, or otherwise  loosely packaged must have a clearance between the fibers and the inside  of the container sufficient to allow for thermal expansions of the tube  buffer without constraining the fibers. The protective container must be  manufactured from a material having a coefficient of friction  sufficiently low to allow the fibers free movement. The loose tube must  contain a suitable water blocking material. Loose tubes must be  removable without damage to the fiber when following the manufacturer's  recommended procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tubes for single mode loose tube cables must be designed to  allow a maximum mid-span buffer tube exposure of 6.096 meters (20 feet).  The buyer should be aware that certain housing hardware may require  cable designed for 6.096 meters of buffer tube storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optical fibers covered in near contact with an extrusion (tight  tube) must have an intermediate soft buffer to allow for thermal  expansions and minor pressures. The buffer tube dimension must be  established by the manufacturer to meet the requirement of this section.  Tight buffer tubes must be removable without damage to the fiber when  following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The tight buffered  fiber must be strippable per paragraph 7.20 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Both loose tube and tight tube coverings of each color and other  fiber package types removed from the finished cable must meet the  following shrinkback and cold bend performance requirements. The fibers  may be left in the tube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shrinkback. Testing must be conducted per paragraph 14.1 of ASTM  D 4565 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(d)), using a talc bed  at a temperature of 95 C (203 F). Shrinkback must not exceed 5 percent  of the original 150 millimeter (6 inches) length of the specimen. The  total shrinkage of the specimen must be measured. (Buffer tube material  meeting this test may not meet the mid-span test in paragraph (t)(15) of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cold bend. Testing must be conducted on at least one tube from  each color in the cable. Stabilize the specimen to -30 [1 C (-22 [2 F)  for a minimum of four hours. While holding the specimen and mandrel at  the test temperature, wrap the tube in a tight helix ten times around a  mandrel with a diameter to be greater than five times the tube diameter  or 50 mm (2 inches). The tube must show no evidence of cracking when  observed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (c)(4)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Channel cores and similar slotted single component core designs do  not need to be tested for cold bend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fiber identification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each fiber within a unit and each unit  within the cable must be identifiable per paragraphs 4.2.1 and 4.3.1 of  ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the following items the colors designated for identification  within the cable must comply with paragraphs 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 of ANSI/ ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)): loose  buffer tubes, tight tube buffer fibers, individual fibers in multi-fiber  tubes, slots, bundles or units of fibers, and the units in cables with  more than one unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Optical fiber ribbon. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each ribbon must be identified per  paragraphs 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by  reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ribbon fiber count must be specified by the end user, i.e., 2,  4, 6, 12, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ribbon dimensions must be as agreed by the end user and  manufacturer per paragraph 3.4.4.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated  by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ribbons must meet each of the following tests. These tests are  included in the paragraphs of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by  reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)), indicated in parenthesis below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ribbon Dimensions (ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 paragraphs 7.14 through  7.14.2)--measures ribbon dimension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ribbon Twist Test (ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 paragraphs 7.15 through  7.15.2)--evaluates the ability of the ribbon to resist splitting or  other damage while undergoing dynamic cyclically twisting the ribbon  under load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ribbon Residual Twist Test (ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 paragraphs 7.16  through 7.16.2)--evaluates the degree of permanent twist in a cabled  optical ribbon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ribbon Separability Test (ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 paragraphs 7.17  through 7.17.2)--evaluates the ability to separate fibers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ribbons must meet paragraph 3.4.4.6 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640  (incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.901(c)), Ribbon Strippability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Strength members. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Strength members may be an integral part  of the cable construction, but are not considered part of the support  messenger for self-supporting optical cable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The strength members may be metallic or nonmetallic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The combined strength of all the strength members must be  sufficient to support the stress of installation and to protect the  cable in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Strength members may be incorporated into the core as a central  support member or filler, as fillers between the fiber packages, as an  annular serving over the core, as an annular serving over the  intermediate jacket, embedded in the outer jacket, or as a combination  of any of these methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The central support member or filler must contain no more than  one splice per kilometer of cable. Individual fillers placed between the  fiber packages and placed as annular servings over the core must contain  no more than one splice per kilometer of cable. Cable sections having  central member or filler splices must meet the same physical  requirements as un-spliced cable sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In each length of completed cable having a metallic central  member, the dielectric strength between the shield   or armor, when present, and the metallic center member must withstand at  least 15 kilovolts when tested per ASTM D 4566 (incorporated by  reference at Sec. 1755.901(d)). The voltage must be applied for 3  seconds minimum; no failures are allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cable core. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Protected fibers may be assembled with the  optional central support member, fillers and strength members in such a  way as to form a cylindrical group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The standard cylindrical group or core designs commonly consist  of 4, 6, 12, 18, or 24 fibers. Cylindrical groups or core designs larger  than the sizes shown above must meet all the applicable requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When threads or tapes are used in cables using water blocking  elements as core binders, they must be a non-hygroscopic and non-wicking  dielectric material or be rendered by the gel or water blocking material  produced by the ingress of water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When threads or tapes are used as unit binders to define optical  fiber units in loose tube, tight tube, slotted, or bundled cored  designs, they must be non-hygroscopic and non-wicking dielectric  material or be rendered by the filling compound or water blocking  material contained in the binder. The colors of the binders must be per  paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Core water blocking. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To prevent the ingress of water into  the core and water migration, a suitable filling compound or water  blocking elements must be applied into the interior of the loose fiber  tubes and into the interstices of the core. When a core wrap is used,  the filling compound or water blocking elements, as the case may be,  must also be applied to the core wrap, over the core wrap and between  the core wrap and inner jacket when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The materials or elements must be homogeneous and uniformly  mixed; free from dirt, metallic particles and other foreign matter;  easily removed; nontoxic and present no dermal hazards. The filling  compound and water blocking elements must contain a suitable antioxidant  or be of such composition as to provide long term stability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The individual cable manufacturer must satisfy the Agency that  the filling compound or water blocking elements selected for use is  suitable for its intended application by submitting test data showing  compliance with ASTM D 4568 (incorporated by reference at  Sec. 1755.901(d)).
