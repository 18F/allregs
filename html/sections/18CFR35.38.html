                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Seller that has been found to have market power in generation  or ancillary services, or that is presumed to have horizontal market  power in generation or ancillary services by virtue of failing or  foregoing the relevant market power screens, as described in 35.37(c),  may adopt the default mitigation detailed in paragraph (b) of this  section for sales of energy or capacity or paragraph (c) of this section  for sales of ancillary services or may propose mitigation tailored to  its own particular circumstances to eliminate its ability to exercise  market power. Mitigation will apply only to the market(s) in which the  Seller is found, or presumed, to have market power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Default mitigation for sales of energy or capacity consists of  three distinct products:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales of power of one week or less priced at the Seller's  incremental cost plus a 10 percent adder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales of power of more than one week but less than one year  priced at no higher than a cost-based ceiling reflecting the costs of  the unit(s) expected to provide the service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New contracts filed for review under section 205 of the Federal  Power Act for sales of power for one year or more priced at a rate not  to exceed embedded cost of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Default mitigation for sales of ancillary services consist of:  (1) A cap based on the relevant OATT ancillary service rate of the  purchasing transmission operator; or (2) the results of a competitive  solicitation that meets the Commission's requirements for transparency,  definition, evaluation, and competitiveness.
