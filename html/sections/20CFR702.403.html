                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The employee shall have the right to choose his/her attending physician from among those authorized by the Director, OWCP, to furnish such care and treatment, except those physicians included on the Secretary's list of

debarred physicians. In determining the choice of a physician, consideration must be given to availability, the employee's condition and the method and means of transportation. Generally 25 miles from the place of injury, or the employee's home is a reasonable distance to travel, but other pertinent factors must also be taken into consideration.
