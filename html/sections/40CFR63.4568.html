                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled coating operation is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Capture system bypass line. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Valve closure monitoring. Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in which the coating operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the coating operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Flow direction indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow direction indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. Each time the flow direction changes, the next reading of the time of occurrence and flow direction must be recorded. The flow direction indicator must be installed in each bypass line or air makeup supply line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in Sec. 63.4520.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers. If you are using a thermal oxidizer or catalytic oxidizer as an add-on control device (including those used with concentrators or with carbon adsorbers to treat desorbed concentrate streams), you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a catalytic oxidizer, install gas temperature monitors upstream and/or downstream of the catalyst bed as required in Sec. 63.3967(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for each gas temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a representative temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a temperature sensor with a measurement sensitivity of 5 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.0 percent of the temperature value, whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before using the sensor for the first time or when relocating or replacing the sensor, perform a validation check by comparing the sensor output to a calibrated temperature measurement device or by comparing the sensor output to a simulated temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Conduct an accuracy audit every quarter and after every deviation. Accuracy audit methods include comparisons of sensor output to redundant temperature sensors, to calibrated temperature measurement devices, or to temperature simulation devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct a visual inspection of each sensor every quarter if redundant temperature sensors are not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regenerative carbon adsorbers. If you are using a regenerative carbon adsorber as an add-on control device, you must monitor the total regeneration desorbing gas (e.g., steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and cooling cycle, and comply with paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) and (d)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regeneration desorbing gas mass flow monitor must be an integrating device having a measurement sensitivity of plus or minus 10 percent capable of recording the total regeneration desorbing gas mass flow for each regeneration cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carbon bed temperature monitor must be capable of recording the temperature within 15 minutes of completing any carbon bed cooling cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all regenerative carbon adsorbers, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for each temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Condensers. If you are using a condenser, you must monitor the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature and comply with paragraphs (a) and (e)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The temperature monitor must provide a gas temperature record at least once every 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all condensers, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (v) of this section for each temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Concentrators.
