                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The types and extent of nondestructive examinations required for piping must be in accordance with this section and Table 136.4 of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). In addition, a visual examination shall be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 100 percent radiography \1\ is required for all Class I, I-L, and II-L piping with wall thickness equal to or greater than 10 mm (.375 in.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nondestructive examination is required for all Class II piping equal to or greater than 18 inches nominal diameter regardless of wall thickness. Any test method acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate nondestructive examinations of other piping systems are required only when deemed necessary by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. In such cases a method of testing satisfactory to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection must be selected from those described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Visual examination. Visual examination consists of observation by the marine inspector of whatever portions of a component or weld are exposed to such observation, either before, during, or after manufacture, fabrication, assembly or test. All welds, pipe and piping components shall be capable of complying with the limitations on imperfections specified in the product specification under which the pipe or component was purchased, or with the limitations on imperfections specified in Sec. 56.70-15(b) (7) and (8), and (c), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nondestructive types of examinations--(1) 100 Percent radiography. Where 100 percent radiography \1\ is required for welds in piping, each weld in the piping shall be completely radiographed. If a butt weld is examined by radiography, for either random or 100 percent radiography, the method used shall be as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Where for some reason, such as joint configuration, radiography is not applicable, another approved examination may be utilized.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X-ray or gamma ray method of radiography may be used. The selection of the method shall be dependent upon its adaptability to the work being radiographed. The procedure to be followed shall be as indicated in PW-51 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a piping component or a weld other than a butt weld is radiographed, the method used shall be in accordance with UW-51 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Random radiography. Where random radiography \1\ is required, one or more welds may be completely or partially radiographed. Random radiography is considered to be a desirable means of spot checking welder performance, particularly in field welding where conditions such as position, ambient temperatures, and cleanliness are not as readily controlled as in shop welding. It is to be employed whenever an Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection questions a pipe weld not otherwise required to be tested. The standards of acceptance are the same as for 100 percent radiography.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ultrasonic. Where 100 percent ultrasonic testing is specified, the entire surface of the weld being inspected shall be covered using extreme care and careful methods to be sure that a true representation of the actual conditions is obtained. The procedures to be

used shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Liquid penetrant. Where liquid penetrant examination is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The examination shall be performed in accordance with appendix VIII to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance shall be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All linear discontinuities and aligned penetrant indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned penetrant indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other discontinuities revealed on the surface need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the pertinent radiographic specification shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Magnetic particle. Where magnetic particle testing is required, the entire surface of the weld being examined shall be covered. The testing shall be performed in accordance with appendix VI to section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The following standards of acceptance are required for welds. All linear discontinuities and aligned indications revealed by the test shall be removed. Aligned indications are those in which the average of the center-to-center distances between any one indication and the two adjacent indications in any straight line is less than three-sixteenths inch. All other revealed discontinuities need not be removed unless the discontinuities are also revealed by radiography, in which case the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be met.
