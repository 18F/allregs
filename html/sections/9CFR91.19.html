A notarized statement from  an engineering concern shall be required to certify to the rate of air  exchange in each compartment. Such notarized statement shall be required  upon first use of such vessel: Provided, That such notarized statement  may again be required by the Administrator if substantive changes in  fittings aboard the vessel have been made since the vessel was last  certified.
