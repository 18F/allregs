                            <p class="depth0">The terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in  Sec. 61.02, or in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Arsenic-containing glass type means any glass that is distinguished  from other glass solely by the weight percent of arsenic added as a raw  material and by the weight percent of arsenic in the glass produced. Any  two or more glasses that have the same weight percent of arsenic in the  raw materials as well as in the glass produced shall be considered to  belong to one arsenic-containing glass type, without regard to the  recipe used or any other characteristics of the glass or the method of  production.</p><p class="depth0">By-pass the control device means to operate the glass melting  furnace without operating the control device to which that furnace's  emissions are directed routinely.</p><p class="depth0">Commercial arsenic means any form of arsenic that is produced by  extraction   from any arsenic-containing substance and is intended for sale or for  intentional use in a manufacturing process. Arsenic that is a naturally  occurring trace constituent of another substance is not considered  ``commercial arsenic.''</p><p class="depth0">Cullet means waste glass recycled to a glass melting furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Glass melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in  which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined,  and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations,  superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat  exchangers, melter cooling system, exhaust system, refractory brick  work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control  systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and  distributing molten glass to forming apparatuses. The forming  apparatuses, including the float bath used in flat glass manufacturing,  are not considered part of the glass melting furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Glass produced means the glass pulled from the glass melting  furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Inorganic arsenic means the oxides and other noncarbon compounds of  the element arsenic included in particulate matter, vapors, and  aerosols.</p><p class="depth0">Malfunction means any sudden failure of air pollution control  equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or  usual manner so that emissions of arsenic are increased.</p><p class="depth0">Pot furnace means a glass melting furnace that contains one or more  refractory vessels in which glass is melted by indirect heating. The  openings of the vessels are in the outside wall of the furnace and are  covered with refractory stoppers during melting.</p><p class="depth0">Rebricking means cold replacement of damaged or worn refractory  parts of the glass melting furnace. Rebricking includes replacement of  the refractories comprising the bottom, sidewalls, or roof of the  melting vessel; replacement of refractory work in the heat exchanger;  and replacement of refractory portions of the glass conditioning and  distribution system.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source for  any purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Theoretical arsenic emissions factor means the amount of inorganic  arsenic, expressed in grams per kilogram of glass produced, as  determined based on a material balance.</p><p class="depth0">Uncontrolled total arsenic emissions means the total inorganic  arsenic in the glass melting furnace exhaust gas preceding any add-on  emission control device.
