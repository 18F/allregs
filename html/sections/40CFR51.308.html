                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section establishes requirements for implementation plans, plan revisions, and periodic progress reviews to address regional haze.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When are the first implementation plans due under the regional haze program? Except as provided in Sec. 51.309(c), each State identified in Sec. 51.300(b)(3) must submit, for the entire State, an implementation plan for regional haze meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section no later than December 17, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What are the core requirements for the implementation plan for regional haze? The State must address regional haze in each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State and in each mandatory Class I Federal area located outside the State which may be affected by emissions from within the State. To meet the core requirements for regional haze for these areas, the State must submit an implementation plan containing the following plan elements and supporting documentation for all required analyses:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonable progress goals. For each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State, the State must establish goals (expressed in deciviews) that provide for reasonable progress towards achieving natural visibility conditions. The reasonable progress goals must provide for an improvement in visibility for the most impaired days over the period of the implementation plan and ensure no degradation in visibility for the least impaired days over the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In establishing a reasonable progress goal for any mandatory Class I Federal area within the State, the State must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Consider the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the energy and non-air quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the remaining useful life of any potentially affected sources, and include a demonstration showing how these factors were taken into consideration in selecting the goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Analyze and determine the rate of progress needed to attain natural visibility conditions by the year 2064. To calculate this rate of progress, the State must compare baseline visibility conditions to natural visibility conditions in the mandatory Federal Class I area and determine the uniform rate of visibility improvement (measured in deciviews) that would need to be maintained during each implementation period in order to attain natural visibility conditions by 2064. In establishing the reasonable progress goal, the State must consider the uniform rate of improvement in visibility and

the emission reduction measures needed to achieve it for the period covered by the implementation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the period of the implementation plan, if the State establishes a reasonable progress goal that provides for a slower rate of improvement in visibility than the rate that would be needed to attain natural conditions by 2064, the State must demonstrate, based on the factors in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, that the rate of progress for the implementation plan to attain natural conditions by 2064 is not reasonable; and that the progress goal adopted by the State is reasonable. The State must provide to the public for review as part of its implementation plan an assessment of the number of years it would take to attain natural conditions if visibility improvement continues at the rate of progress selected by the State as reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether the State's goal for visibility improvement provides for reasonable progress towards natural visibility conditions, the Administrator will evaluate the demonstrations developed by the State pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In developing each reasonable progress goal, the State must consult with those States which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in the mandatory Class I Federal area. In any situation in which the State cannot agree with another such State or group of States that a goal provides for reasonable progress, the State must describe in its submittal the actions taken to resolve the disagreement. In reviewing the State's implementation plan submittal, the Administrator will take this information into account in determining whether the State's goal for visibility improvement provides for reasonable progress towards natural visibility conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The reasonable progress goals established by the State are not directly enforceable but will be considered by the Administrator in evaluating the adequacy of the measures in the implementation plan to achieve the progress goal adopted by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The State may not adopt a reasonable progress goal that represents less visibility improvement than is expected to result from implementation of other requirements of the CAA during the applicable planning period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculations of baseline and natural visibility conditions. For each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State, the State must determine the following visibility conditions (expressed in deciviews):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Baseline visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days. The period for establishing baseline visibility conditions is 2000 to 2004. Baseline visibility conditions must be calculated, using available monitoring data, by establishing the average degree of visibility impairment for the most and least impaired days for each calendar year from 2000 to 2004. The baseline visibility conditions are the average of these annual values. For mandatory Class I Federal areas without onsite monitoring data for 2000-2004, the State must establish baseline values using the most representative available monitoring data for 2000-2004, in consultation with the Administrator or his or her designee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an implementation plan that is submitted by 2003, the period for establishing baseline visibility conditions for the period of the first long-term strategy is the most recent 5-year period for which visibility monitoring data are available for the mandatory Class I Federal areas addressed by the plan. For mandatory Class I Federal areas without onsite monitoring data, the State must establish baseline values using the most representative available monitoring data, in consultation with the Administrator or his or her designee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Natural visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days. Natural visibility conditions must be calculated by estimating the degree of visibility impairment existing under natural conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days, based on available monitoring information and appropriate data analysis techniques; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(A)</em> For the first implementation plan addressing the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section,

the number of deciviews by which baseline conditions exceed natural visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the first implementation plan addressing the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section,

the number of deciviews by which baseline conditions exceed natural visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For all future implementation plan revisions, the number of deciviews by which current conditions, as calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, exceed natural visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Long-term strategy for regional haze. Each State listed in Sec. 51.300(b)(3) must submit a long-term strategy that addresses regional haze visibility impairment for each mandatory Class I Federal area within the State and for each mandatory Class I Federal area located outside the State which may be affected by emissions from the State. The long-term strategy must include enforceable emissions limitations, compliance schedules, and other measures as necessary to achieve the reasonable progress goals established by States having mandatory Class I Federal areas. In establishing its long-term strategy for regional haze, the State must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where the State has emissions that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in any mandatory Class I Federal area located in another State or States, the State must consult with the other State(s) in order to develop coordinated emission management strategies. The State must consult with any other State having emissions that are reasonably anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in any mandatory Class I Federal area within the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where other States cause or contribute to impairment in a mandatory Class I Federal area, the State must demonstrate that it has included in its implementation plan all measures necessary to obtain its share of the emission reductions needed to meet the progress goal for the area. If the State has participated in a regional planning process, the State must ensure it has included all measures needed to achieve its apportionment of emission reduction obligations agreed upon through that process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The State must document the technical basis, including modeling, monitoring and emissions information, on which the State is relying to determine its apportionment of emission reduction obligations necessary for achieving reasonable progress in each mandatory Class I Federal area it affects. The State may meet this requirement by relying on technical analyses developed by the regional planning organization and approved by all State participants. The State must identify the baseline emissions inventory on which its strategies are based. The baseline emissions inventory year is presumed to be the most recent year of the consolidate periodic emissions inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State must identify all anthropogenic sources of visibility impairment considered by the State in developing its long-term strategy. The State should consider major and minor stationary sources, mobile sources, and area sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The State must consider, at a minimum, the following factors in developing its long-term strategy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs, including measures to address reasonably attributable visibility impairment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Emissions limitations and schedules for compliance to achieve the reasonable progress goal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Source retirement and replacement schedules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Smoke management techniques for agricultural and forestry management purposes including plans as currently exist within the State for these purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Enforceability of emissions limitations and control measures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The anticipated net effect on visibility due to projected changes in point, area, and mobile source emissions over the period addressed by the long-term strategy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring strategy and other implementation plan requirements. The State must submit with the implementation plan a monitoring strategy for measuring, characterizing, and reporting of regional haze visibility impairment that is representative of all mandatory Class I Federal areas within the State.

This monitoring strategy must be coordinated with the monitoring strategy required in Sec. 51.305 for reasonably attributable visibility impairment. Compliance with this requirement may be met through participation in the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments network. The implementation plan must also provide for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The establishment of any additional monitoring sites or equipment needed to assess whether reasonable progress goals to address regional haze for all mandatory Class I Federal areas within the State are being achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures by which monitoring data and other information are used in determining the contribution of emissions from within the State to regional haze visibility impairment at mandatory Class I Federal areas both within and outside the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a State with no mandatory Class I Federal areas, procedures by which monitoring data and other information are used in determining the contribution of emissions from within the State to regional haze visibility impairment at mandatory Class I Federal areas in other States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The implementation plan must provide for the reporting of all visibility monitoring data to the Administrator at least annually for each mandatory Class I Federal area in the State. To the extent possible, the State should report visibility monitoring data electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statewide inventory of emissions of pollutants that are reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in any mandatory Class I Federal area. The inventory must include emissions for a baseline year, emissions for the most recent year for which data are available, and estimates of future projected emissions. The State must also include a commitment to update the inventory periodically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other elements, including reporting, recordkeeping, and other measures, necessary to assess and report on visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for regional haze visibility impairment. The State must submit an implementation plan containing emission limitations representing BART and schedules for compliance with BART for each BART-eligible source that may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area, unless the State demonstrates that an emissions trading program or other alternative will achieve greater reasonable progress toward natural visibility conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To address the requirements for BART, the State must submit an implementation plan containing the following plan elements and include documentation for all required analyses:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A list of all BART-eligible sources within the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A determination of BART for each BART-eligible source in the State that emits any air pollutant which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area. All such sources are subject to BART.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The determination of BART must be based on an analysis of the best system of continuous emission control technology available and associated emission reductions achievable for each BART-eligible source that is subject to BART within the State. In this analysis, the State must take into consideration the technology available, the costs of compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, any pollution control equipment in use at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of BART for fossil-fuel fired power plants having a total generating capacity greater than 750 megawatts must be made pursuant to the guidelines in appendix Y of this part (Guidelines for BART Determinations Under the Regional Haze Rule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exception.  A State is not required to make a determination of BART for SO2 or for NOX if a BART-eligible source has the potential to emit less than 40 tons per year of such pollutant(s), or for PM10 if a BART-eligible

source has the potential to emit less than 15 tons per year of such pollutant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the State determines in establishing BART that technological or economic limitations on the applicability of measurement methodology to a particular source would make the imposition of an emission standard infeasible, it may instead prescribe a design, equipment, work practice, or other operational standard, or combination thereof, to require the application of BART. Such standard, to the degree possible, is to set forth the emission reduction to be achieved by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and must provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A requirement that each source subject to BART be required to install and operate BART as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than 5 years after approval of the implementation plan revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A requirement that each source subject to BART maintain the control equipment required by this subpart and establish procedures to ensure such equipment is properly operated and maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State may opt to implement or require participation in an emissions trading program or other alternative measure rather than to require sources subject to BART to install, operate, and maintain BART. Such an emissions trading program or other alternative measure must achieve greater reasonable progress than would be achieved through the installation and operation of BART. For all such emission trading programs or other alternative measures, the State must submit an implementation plan containing the following plan elements and include documentation for all required analyses:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A demonstration that the emissions trading program or other alternative measure will achieve greater reasonable progress than would have resulted from the installation and operation of BART at all sources subject to BART in the State and covered by the alternative program. This demonstration must be based on the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A list of all BART-eligible sources within the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A list of all BART-eligible sources and all BART source categories covered by the alternative program. The State is not required to include every BART source category or every BART-eligible source within a BART source category in an alternative program, but each BART-eligible source in the State must be subject to the requirements of the alternative program, have a federally enforceable emission limitation determined by the State and approved by EPA as meeting BART in accordance with section 302(c) or paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or otherwise addressed under paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(4)of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An analysis of the best system of continuous emission control technology available and associated emission reductions achievable for each source within the State subject to BART and covered by the alternative program. This analysis must be conducted by making a determination of BART for each source subject to BART and covered by the alternative program as provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the emissions trading program or other alternative measure has been designed to meet a requirement other than BART (such as the core requirement to have a long-term strategy to achieve the reasonable progress goals established by States). In this case, the State may determine the best system of continuous emission control technology and associated emission reductions for similar types of sources within a source category based on both source-specific and category-wide information, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An analysis of the projected emissions reductions achievable through the trading program or other alternative measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A determination under paragraph (e)(3) of this section or otherwise based on the clear weight of evidence that the trading program or other alternative measure achieves greater reasonable progress than would be achieved through the installation and operation of BART at the covered sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A requirement that all necessary emission reductions take place during the period of the first long-term strategy for regional haze. To meet this requirement, the State must provide a detailed description of the emissions trading program or other alternative measure, including schedules for implementation, the emission reductions required by the program, all necessary administrative and technical procedures for implementing the program, rules for accounting and monitoring emissions, and procedures for enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A demonstration that the emission reductions resulting from the emissions trading program or other alternative measure will be surplus to those reductions resulting from measures adopted to meet requirements of the CAA as of the baseline date of the SIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> At the State's option, a provision that the emissions trading program or other alternative measure may include a geographic enhancement to the program to address the requirement under Sec. 51.302(c) related to BART for reasonably attributable impairment from the pollutants covered under the emissions trading program or other alternative measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For plans that include an emissions trading program that establishes a cap on total annual emissions of SO2 or NOX from sources subject to the program, requires the owners and operators of sources to hold allowances or authorizations to emit equal to emissions, and allows the owners and operators of sources and other entities to purchase, sell, and transfer allowances, the following elements are required concerning the emissions covered by the cap:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Applicability provisions defining the sources subject to the program. The State must demonstrate that the applicability provisions (including the size criteria for including sources in the program) are designed to prevent any significant potential shifting within the State of production and emissions from sources in the program to sources outside the program. In the case of a program covering sources in multiple States, the States must demonstrate that the applicability provisions in each State cover essentially the same size facilities and, if source categories are specified, cover the same source categories and prevent any significant, potential shifting within such States of production and emissions to sources outside the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Allowance provisions ensuring that the total value of allowances (in tons) issued each year under the program will not exceed the emissions cap (in tons) on total annual emissions from the sources in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Monitoring provisions providing for consistent and accurate measurements of emissions from sources in the program to ensure that each allowance actually represents the same specified tonnage of emissions and that emissions are measured with similar accuracy at all sources in the program. The monitoring provisions must require that boilers, combustion turbines, and cement kilns in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must comply with the requirements of part 75 of this chapter. The monitoring provisions must require that other sources in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must provide emissions information with the same precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness as information provided under part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Recordkeeping provisions that ensure the enforceability of the emissions monitoring provisions and other program requirements. The recordkeeping provisions must require that boilers, combustion turbines, and cement kilns in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must comply with the recordkeeping provisions of part 75 of this chapter. The recordkeeping provisions must require that other sources in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must comply with recordkeeping requirements that, as compared with the recordkeeping provisions under part 75 of this chapter, are of comparable stringency and require recording of comparable types of information and retention of the records for comparable periods of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Reporting provisions requiring timely reporting of monitoring data with sufficient frequency to ensure the

enforceability of the emissions monitoring provisions and other program requirements and the ability to audit the program. The reporting provisions must require that boilers, combustion turbines, and cement kilns in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must comply with the reporting provisions of part 75 of this chapter, except that, if the Administrator is not the tracking system administrator for the program, emissions may be reported to the tracking system administrator, rather than to the Administrator. The reporting provisions must require that other sources in the program allowed to sell or transfer allowances must comply with reporting requirements that, as compared with the reporting provisions under part 75 of this chapter, are of comparable stringency and require reporting of comparable types of information and require comparable timeliness and frequency of reporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Tracking system provisions which provide for a tracking system that is publicly available in a secure, centralized database to track in a consistent manner all allowances and emissions in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Authorized account representative provisions ensuring that the owners and operators of a source designate one individual who is authorized to represent the owners and operators in all matters pertaining to the trading program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Allowance transfer provisions providing procedures that allow timely transfer and recording of allowances, minimize administrative barriers to the operation of the allowance market, and ensure that such procedures apply uniformly to all sources and other potential participants in the allowance market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Compliance provisions prohibiting a source from emitting a total tonnage of a pollutant that exceeds the tonnage value of its allowance holdings, including the methods and procedures for determining whether emissions exceed allowance holdings. Such method and procedures shall apply consistently from source to source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Penalty provisions providing for mandatory allowance deductions for excess emissions that apply consistently from source to source. The tonnage value of the allowances deducted shall equal at least three times the tonnage of the excess emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> For a trading program that allows banking of allowances, provisions clarifying any restrictions on the use of these banked allowances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Program assessment provisions providing for periodic program evaluation to assess whether the program is accomplishing its goals and whether modifications to the program are needed to enhance performance of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A State which opts under 40 CFR 51.308(e)(2) to implement an emissions trading program or other alternative measure rather than to require sources subject to BART to install, operate, and maintain BART may satisfy the final step of the demonstration required by that section as follows: If the distribution of emissions is not substantially different than under BART, and the alternative measure results in greater emission reductions, then the alternative measure may be deemed to achieve greater reasonable progress. If the distribution of emissions is significantly different, the State must conduct dispersion modeling to determine differences in visibility between BART and the trading program for each impacted Class I area, for the worst and best 20 percent of days. The modeling would demonstrate ``greater reasonable progress'' if both of the following two criteria are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Visibility does not decline in any Class I area, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is an overall improvement in visibility, determined by comparing the average differences between BART and the alternative over all affected Class I areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A State subject to a trading program established in accordance with Sec. 52.38 or Sec. 52.39 under a Transport Rule Federal Implementation Plan need not require BART-eligible fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants in the State to install, operate, and maintain BART for the pollutant covered by such trading program in the State. A State that chooses to meet the emission reduction requirements of the Transport Rule by

submitting a SIP revision that establishes a trading program and is approved as meeting the requirements of Sec. 52.38 or Sec. 52.39 also need not require BART-eligible fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants in the State to install, operate, and maintain BART for the pollutant covered by such trading program in the State. A State may adopt provisions, consistent with the requirements applicable to the State for a trading program established in accordance with Sec. 52.38 or Sec. 52.39 under the Transport Rule Federal Implementation Plan or established under a SIP revision that is approved as meeting the requirements of Sec. 52.38 or Sec. 52.39, for a geographic enhancement to the program to address the requirement under Sec. 51.302(c) related to BART for reasonably attributable impairment from the pollutant covered by such trading program in that State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> After a State has met the requirements for BART or implemented emissions trading program or other alternative measure that achieves more reasonable progress than the installation and operation of BART, BART-eligible sources will be subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section in the same manner as other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any BART-eligible facility subject to the requirement under paragraph (e) of this section to install, operate, and maintain BART may apply to the Administrator for an exemption from that requirement. An application for an exemption will be subject to the requirements of Sec. 51.303(a)(2)-(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for comprehensive periodic revisions of implementation plans for regional haze. Each State identified in Sec. 51.300(b)(3) must revise and submit its regional haze implementation plan revision to EPA by July 31, 2018 and every ten years thereafter. In each plan revision, the State must evaluate and reassess all of the elements required in paragraph (d) of this section, taking into account improvements in monitoring data collection and analysis techniques, control technologies, and other relevant factors. In evaluating and reassessing these elements, the State must address the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days, and actual progress made towards natural conditions during the previous implementation period. The period for calculating current visibility conditions is the most recent five year period preceding the required date of the implementation plan submittal for which data are available. Current visibility conditions must be calculated based on the annual average level of visibility impairment for the most and least impaired days for each of these five years. Current visibility conditions are the average of these annual values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The effectiveness of the long-term strategy for achieving reasonable progress goals over the prior implementation period(s); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Affirmation of, or revision to, the reasonable progress goal in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the State established a reasonable progress goal for the prior period which provided a slower rate of progress than that needed to attain natural conditions by the year 2064, the State must evaluate and determine the reasonableness, based on the factors in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, of additional measures that could be adopted to achieve the degree of visibility improvement projected by the analysis contained in the first implementation plan described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Requirements for periodic reports describing progress towards the reasonable progress goals. Each State identified in Sec. 51.300(b)(3) must submit a report to the Administrator every 5 years evaluating progress towards the reasonable progress goal for each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State and in each mandatory Class I Federal area located outside the State which may be affected by emissions from within the State. The first progress report is due 5 years from submittal of the initial implementation plan addressing paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. The progress reports must be in the form of implementation plan revisions that comply with the procedural requirements of Sec. 51.102 and Sec. 51.103. Periodic progress reports must contain at a minimum the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A description of the status of implementation of all measures included

in the implementation plan for achieving reasonable progress goals for mandatory Class I Federal areas both within and outside the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A summary of the emissions reductions achieved throughout the State through implementation of the measures described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each mandatory Class I Federal area within the State, the State must assess the following visibility conditions and changes, with values for most impaired and least impaired days expressed in terms of 5-year averages of these annual values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The current visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The difference between current visibility conditions for the most impaired and least impaired days and baseline visibility conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The change in visibility impairment for the most impaired and least impaired days over the past 5 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An analysis tracking the change over the past 5 years in emissions of pollutants contributing to visibility impairment from all sources and activities within the State. Emissions changes should be identified by type of source or activity. The analysis must be based on the most recent updated emissions inventory, with estimates projected forward as necessary and appropriate, to account for emissions changes during the applicable 5-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An assessment of any significant changes in anthropogenic emissions within or outside the State that have occurred over the past 5 years that have limited or impeded progress in reducing pollutant emissions and improving visibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An assessment of whether the current implementation plan elements and strategies are sufficient to enable the State, or other States with mandatory Federal Class I areas affected by emissions from the State, to meet all established reasonable progress goals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A review of the State's visibility monitoring strategy and any modifications to the strategy as necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Determination of the adequacy of existing implementation plan. At the same time the State is required to submit any 5-year progress report to EPA in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, the State must also take one of the following actions based upon the information presented in the progress report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the State determines that the existing implementation plan requires no further substantive revision at this time in order to achieve established goals for visibility improvement and emissions reductions, the State must provide to the Administrator a negative declaration that further revision of the existing implementation plan is not needed at this time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the State determines that the implementation plan is or may be inadequate to ensure reasonable progress due to emissions from sources in another State(s) which participated in a regional planning process, the State must provide notification to the Administrator and to the other State(s) which participated in the regional planning process with the States. The State must also collaborate with the other State(s) through the regional planning process for the purpose of developing additional strategies to address the plan's deficiencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the State determines that the implementation plan is or may be inadequate to ensure reasonable progress due to emissions from sources in another country, the State shall provide notification, along with available information, to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the State determines that the implementation plan is or may be inadequate to ensure reasonable progress due to emissions from sources within the State, the State shall revise its implementation plan to address the plan's deficiencies within one year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> What are the requirements for State and Federal Land Manager coordination?
