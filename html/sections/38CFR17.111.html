                                Sec.  17.111  Copayments for extended care services.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section sets forth requirements regarding  copayments for extended care services provided to veterans by VA (either  directly by VA or paid for by VA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Copayments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless exempted under paragraph (f) of this  section, as a condition of receiving extended care services from VA, a  veteran must agree to pay VA and is obligated to pay VA a copayment as  specified by this section. A veteran has no obligation to pay a  copayment for the first 21 days of extended care services that VA  provided the veteran in any 12-month period (the 12-month period begins  on the date that VA first provided extended care services to the  veteran). However, for each day that extended care services are provided  beyond the first 21 days, a veteran is obligated to pay VA the copayment  amount set forth below to the extent the veteran has available  resources. Available resources are based on monthly calculations, as  determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The following sets forth  the extended care services provided by VA and the corresponding  copayment amount per day:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adult day health care--$15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Domiciliary care--$5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Institutional respite care--$97.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Institutional geriatric evaluation--$97.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Non-institutional geriatric evaluation--$15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Non-institutional respite care--$15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Nursing home care--$97.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of counting the number of days for which a veteran  is obligated to make a copayment under this section, VA will count each  day that adult day health care, non-institutional geriatric evaluation,  and non-institutional respite care are provided and will count each full  day and partial day for each inpatient stay except for the day of  discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For hospital care and medical services considered non- institutional care furnished through the Veterans Choice Program under  Sec.  17.1500 through 17.1540, the copayment amount at the time of  furnishing such care or services by a non-VA entity or provider is $0.  VA will determine and assess the veteran's copayment amount at the end  of the billing process, but at no time will a veteran's copayment be  more than the amount identified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adult day health care is a therapeutic outpatient care program  that provides medical services, rehabilitation, therapeutic activities,  socialization, nutrition and transportation   services to disabled veterans in a congregate setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Domiciliary care is defined in Sec.  17.30(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Extended care services means adult day health care, domiciliary  care, institutional geriatric evaluation, noninstitutional geriatric  evaluation, nursing home care, institutional respite care, and  noninstitutional respite care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Geriatric evaluation is a specialized, diagnostic/consultative  service provided by an interdisciplinary team that is for the purpose of  providing a comprehensive assessment, care plan, and extended care  service recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Institutional means a setting in a hospital, domiciliary, or  nursing home of overnight stays of one or more days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Noninstitutional means a service that does not include an  overnight stay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Nursing home care means the accommodation of convalescents or  other persons who are not acutely ill and not in need of hospital care,  but who require nursing care and related medical services, if such  nursing care and medical services are prescribed by, or are performed  under the general direction of, persons duly licensed to provide such  care (nursing services must be provided 24 hours a day). Such term  includes services furnished in skilled nursing care facilities. Such  term excludes hospice care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Respite care means care which is of limited duration, is  furnished on an intermittent basis to a veteran who is suffering from a  chronic illness and who resides primarily at home, and is furnished for  the purpose of helping the veteran to continue residing primarily at  home. (Respite providers temporarily replace the caregivers to provide  services ranging from supervision to skilled care needs.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of the veteran's financial resources on obligation to pay  copayment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A veteran is obligated to pay the copayment to the extent  the veteran and the veteran's spouse have available resources.

For veterans who have been receiving  extended care services for 181 days or more, their available resources  are the sum of the value of the liquid assets, the fixed assets, and the  income of the veteran and the veteran's spouse, minus the sum of the  veterans allowance, the spousal allowance, the spousal resource  protection amount, and (but only if the veteran--has a spouse or  dependents residing in the community who is not institutionalized)  expenses.

This includes household and personal items (e.g., furniture, clothing,  and jewelry) except when the veteran's spouse or dependents are living  in the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Spousal allowance is an allowance of $20 per day that is  included only if the spouse resides in the community (not  institutionalized).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Spousal resource protection amount means the value of liquid  assets equal to the Maximum Community Spouse Resource Standard published  by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as of January 1  of the current calendar year if the spouse is residing in the community  (not institutionalized).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Veterans allowance is an allowance of $20 per day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The maximum amount of a copayment for any month equals the  copayment amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section  multiplied by the number of days in the month. The copayment for any  month may be less than the amount specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section if the veteran provides information in accordance with this  section to establish that the copayment should be reduced or eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requirement to submit information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless exempted under  paragraph (f) of this section, a veteran must submit to a VA medical  facility a completed VA Form 10-10EC and documentation requested by the  Form at the following times:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of initial request for an episode of extended care  services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of request for extended care services after a break  in provision of extended care services for more than 30 days; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each year at the time of submission to VA of VA Form 10-10EZ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When there are changes that might change the copayment  obligation (i.e., changes regarding marital status, fixed assets, liquid  assets, expenses, income (when received), or whether the veteran has a  spouse or dependents residing in the community), the veteran must report  those changes to a VA medical facility within 10 days of the change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Veterans and care that are not subject to the copayment  requirements. The following veterans and care are not subject to the  copayment requirements of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A veteran with a compensable service-connected disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A veteran whose annual income (determined under 38 U.S.C. 1503)  is less than the amount in effect under 38 U.S.C. 1521(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Care for a veteran's noncompensable zero percent service- connected disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An episode of extended care services that began on or before  November 30, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Care authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1710(e) for Vietnam-era  herbicide-exposed veterans, radiation-exposed veterans, Persian Gulf War  veterans,post-Persian Gulf War combat-exposed veterans, or Camp Lejeune  veterans pursuant to Sec.  17.400.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Care for treatment of sexual trauma as authorized under 38  U.S.C. 1720D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Care or services authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1720E for certain  veterans regarding cancer of the head or neck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A veteran who VA determines to be catastrophically disabled, as  defined in 38 CFR 17.36(e), is exempt from copayments for adult day  health care, non-institutional respite care, and non-institutional  geriatric care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A veteran receiving care for psychosis or a mental illness other  than psychosis pursuant to Sec.  17.109.
