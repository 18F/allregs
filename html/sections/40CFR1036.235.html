                                Sec.  1036.235  Testing requirements for certification.

                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the greenhouse gas emission standards in Sec.  1036.108.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Select a single emission-data engine from each engine family as specified in 40 CFR part 86. The standards of this part apply only with respect to emissions measured from this tested configuration and other configurations identified in Sec.  1036.205(e). Note that configurations identified in Sec.  1036.205(e) are considered to be ``tested configurations'' whether or not you actually tested them for certification. However, you must apply the same (or equivalent) emission controls to all other engine configurations in the engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of this part. In the case of dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines, measure emissions when operating with each type of fuel for which you intend to certify the engine. Measure CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions using the specified duty cycle(s), including cold-start and hot-start testing as specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. If you are certifying the engine for use in tractors, you must measure CO2 emissions using the SET cycle and measure CH4, and N2O emissions using the transient cycle. If you are certifying the engine for use in vocational applications, you must measure CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions using the specified transient duty cycle, including cold-start and hot-start testing as specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N. Engines certified for use in tractors may also be used in vocational vehicles; however, you may not knowingly circumvent the intent of this part (to reduce in-use emissions of CO2) by certifying engines designed for vocational vehicles (and rarely used in tractors) to the SET and not the transient cycle. For example, we would generally not allow you to certify all your engines to the SET without certifying any to the transient cycle. You may certify your engine family for both tractor and vocational use by submitting CO2 emission data from both SET and transient cycle testing and specifying FCLs for both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may measure emissions from any of your emission-data engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the engine to a test facility we designate. The engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If we measure emissions on your engine, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the physically adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything

we do not consider an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply for an engine parameter that is subject to production variability because it is adjustable during production, but is not considered an adjustable parameter (as defined in Sec.  1036.801) because it is permanently sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year or other characteristics unrelated to emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements that apply to the engine family covered by the application for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may require you to test a second engine of the same configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.</p>
