                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope of the regulations. The regulations in this section are prescribed as protective measures. They supplement the general regulations contained in Sec. 207.440 the provisions of which shall remain in full force and effect except as modified by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions on transit of vessels. The following classes of vessels will not be permitted to transit the U.S. locks or enter any of the United States approach canals:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)-(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tanker vessels--(i) Hazardous material. Cleaning and gas freeing of tanks on all hazardous material cargo vessels (as defined in 49 CFR part 171) shall not take place in a lock or any part of the Soo Locks approach canals from the outer end of the east center pier to the outer end of the southwest pier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hazardous material. Cleaning and gas freeing of tanks on all hazardous material cargo vessels (as defined in 49 CFR part 171) shall not take place in a lock or any part of the Soo Locks approach canals from the outer end of the east center pier to the outer end of the southwest pier.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Approaching. Whenever a tank vessel is approaching the Soo Locks and within the limits of the lock piers (outer ends of the southwest and east center piers) either above or below the locks, no other vessel will be released from the locks in the direction of the approaching tank vessel, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, until the tank vessel is within the lock chamber or securely moored to the approach pier. Whenever a tank vessel is within a Soo Lock Chamber, the tank vessel, unless certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products, will not be released from the lock until the channel within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the lock, in the direction of the tank vessel, is clear of vessels or vessels therein are securely moored to the approach pier. This limits movement to a single vessel whenever a tank vessel is within the limits of the lock piers either above or below the locks, unless the tank vessel is certified gas free or is carrying non-combustible products. Tank vessels to which this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) applies include those vessels carrying fuel oil, gasoline, crude oil or other flammable liquids in bulk, including vessels that are not certified gas free where the previous cargo was one of these liquids.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Locks park. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, tankers with any type cargo will be permitted to transit the MacArthur Lock when the locks park is closed. The exact dates and times that the park is closed varies, but generally these periods are from midnight to 6 a.m. June through September with one or two hour closure extensions in the early and late seasons. Tankers carrying non-combustible products that will not react hazardously with water or tankers that have been purged of gas or hazardous fumes and certified gas free will be allowed to transit the MacArthur Lock when the park is open.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Carrying explosives. All vessels, except U.S. vessels of war and public vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101, carrying explosives are prohibited from transiting the U.S. Locks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Personnel restrictions. Masters of vessels are responsible for the conduct of crew and passengers while transiting St. Marys Falls Canal and Locks and for strict compliance with the regulations. The following procedures are established for the control of persons embarking or debarking from vessels while transiting the locks:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The master or mate and not more than three deckhands will be permitted to go ashore from transiting vessels and then only for normal operations and business incident to the transit. A maximum of four men will be permitted ashore at any one time from any one ship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personnel--(i) Embarking. Personnel, including technicians, repairmen, and company officials will be permitted to embark at the locks if they are in possession of a letter addressed to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, from the vessel's master, the operators of the vessel, or the Lake Carriers' Association, requesting that the individual named therein be permitted to embark on a particular vessel. United States vessel personnel must also be in possession of a specially validated seaman's document issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. Their papers will be presented to the civilian guard on duty at the main gate on Portage Avenue who will arrange escort from the gate to

the vessel. Luggage will be subject to inspection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Embarking. Personnel, including technicians, repairmen, and company officials will be permitted to embark at the locks if they are in possession of a letter addressed to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, from the vessel's master, the operators of the vessel, or the Lake Carriers' Association, requesting that the individual named therein be permitted to embark on a particular vessel. United States vessel personnel must also be in possession of a specially validated seaman's document issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. Their papers will be presented to the civilian guard on duty at the main gate on Portage Avenue who will arrange escort from the gate to

the vessel. Luggage will be subject to inspection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Debarking. The vessel master will furnish prior notification to the Chief Lockmaster at St. Marys Falls Canal Tower (Radio Call WUD-31) that he has vessel personnel, technicians, repairmen or company officials aboard for whom he requests authority to debark. If authority to debark is granted such personnel will be furnished a letter by the vessel master, addressed to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, giving the name and position of the individual concerned. Personnel will not debark until they have been properly identified by a licensed officer of the vessel and the letter furnished to the escort provided from the civilian guard detail who will escort personnel to the gate. In the event a person debarking for medical attention is a litter case, notification will be given sufficiently in advance to permit the Chief Lockmaster to route the vessel to the MacArthur Lock in order that the long carry over the lock gates may be avoided. The Area Engineer will make the necessary arrangements for clearance of ambulances and medical personnel into the lock area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No passengers or guest passengers will be permitted to embark or debark at St. Marys Falls Canal except in emergency when medical attention is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Letters cited in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are valid only for a single passage through the lock area. In the event frequent access to the area is required a request for extended access with reasons therefor will be submitted to the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, who may arrange for the necessary clearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Emergency needs to embark or debark which develop with insufficient time to follow the procedure outlined in this paragraph will be approved or disapproved by the Area Engineer, St. Marys Falls Canal, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, according to the circumstances of the individual case, and requests therefor should be promptly directed to him.
