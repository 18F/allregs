                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the Rules Counsel determines there is probable cause to  believe that a covered attorney has committed misconduct or other  violations of this part, and poses a substantial threat of irreparable  harm to his or her clients or the orderly administration of military  justice, the Rules Counsel shall so advise the JAG. Examples of when a  covered attorney may pose a ``substantial threat of irreparable harm''  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When charged with the commission of a crime which involves moral  turpitude or reflects adversely upon the covered attorney's fitness to  practice law, and where substantial evidence exists to support the  charge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When engaged in the unauthorized practice of law (e.g., failure  to maintain good standing in accordance with Sec. 776.71 of this part);  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where unable to represent client interests competently.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of information from the Rules Counsel, JAG may  order the covered attorney to show cause why he or she should not face  interim suspension, pending completion of a professional responsibility  investigation. The covered attorney shall have 10 calendar days in which  to respond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an order to show cause has been issued under paragraph (b) of  this section, and the period for response has passed without a response,  or after consideration of any response and finding sufficient evidence  demonstrating probable cause to believe that the covered attorney is  guilty of misconduct and poses a substantial threat of irreparable harm  to his or her client or the orderly administration of military justice,  JAG may direct an interim suspension of the covered attorney's  certification under Articles 26(b) or 27(b), UCMJ, or R.C.M. 502(d)(3),  or the authority to provide legal assistance, pending the results of the  investigation and final action under this instruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 10 days of JAG's decision to impose an interim  suspension, the covered attorney may request an opportunity to be heard  before an impartial officer designated by JAG. Where so requested, that  opportunity will be scheduled within 10 calendar days of the request.  The designated officer shall receive any information that the covered  attorney chooses to submit on the limited issue of whether to continue  the interim suspension. The designated officer shall submit a  recommendation to JAG within 5 calendar days of conclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A covered attorney may, based upon a claim of changed  circumstances or newly discovered evidence, petition for dissolution or  amendment of JAG's imposition of interim suspension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any professional responsibility investigation involving a  covered attorney who has been suspended pursuant to this section shall  proceed and be concluded without appreciable delay. However, JAG may  determine it necessary to await completion of a related criminal  investigation or proceeding, or completion of a professional  responsibility action initiated by other licensing authorities. In such  cases, JAG shall cause the Rules Counsel to so notify the covered  attorney under interim suspension. Where necessary, continuation of the  interim suspension shall be reviewed by JAG every 6 months.</p>
