                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority of lockmaster. The lockmaster shall be charged with the immediate control and management of the lock, and of the area set aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. He shall see that all laws, rules and regulations for the use of the lock and lock area are duly complied with, to which end he is authorized to give all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith, both to employees of the Government and to any and every person within the limits of the lock or lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No one shall cause any movement of any vessel, boat, or other floating thing in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the lockmaster or his assistants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Signals. Steamboats or tows desiring lockage in either direction shall give notice to the lock tenders, when not more than three-fourths mile from

the lock, by one long blast of (10 seconds' duration), followed by one short blast (of three seconds' duration), or a whistle or horn. When the lock is ready for entrance a green light will be shown from the river wall. An amber light will indicate that the lock is being made ready for entrance. A red light will indicate that the approaching vessel must wait. Whenever local conditions make it advisable the visual signals will be supplemented by sound signals as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One long blast of a horn to indicate that the vessel must wait.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One short blast of a horn to indicate that the lock is being made ready for entrance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two short blasts of a horn to indicate permission to enter the lock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Four short and rapid blasts to attract attention, indicate caution, and signal danger.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Draft of boats. Deep-draft boats must clear the miter sills by at least 3 inches. Boats drawing too much water will not be allowed to lighter cargo in the entrances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Precedence at the lock. The vessel arriving first at the lock shall be first to lock through; but precedence shall be given to vessels belonging to the United States and to commercial vessels in the order named. Arrival posts or markers may be established ashore above or below the lock. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be considered as having arrived at the lock within the meaning of this paragraph. If the traffic is crowded in both directions; up and down lockages will usually be made alternately, but the lock tender may permit two or more lockages to be made at one time in the same direction when this will not cause unreasonable delay. In case two or more boats or tows are to enter for the same lockage, they shall enter as directed by the lock tender. No boat shall run ahead of another while in the lock. The boat that enters first shall leave first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lockage of pleasure boats. The lockage of pleasure boats, house boats or like craft shall be expedited by locking them through with commercial craft (other than barges carrying gasoline or highly hazardous materials) in order to utilize the capacity of the lock to its maximum. Lockage of pleasure craft may be made with commercial craft carrying petroleum products other than gasoline, provided a clear distance of at least 100 feet between such vessels can be maintained in the lock. If, after the arrival of such craft, no separate or combined lockage can be accomplished within a reasonable time, not to exceed the time required for three other lockages, then separate lockage shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Stations while waiting. Boats waiting their turn to enter the lock must lie at a sufficient distance from the lock and in such a position as to leave sufficient room for the passage of boats leaving the lock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unnecessary delay. (1) Boats must not cause delay in entering or leaving the lock. Masters and pilots will be held to a strict accountability in this matter, and those with tows must provide enough men to move barges promptly. Boats failing to enter the lock with reasonable promptness after being signaled will lose their turn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Boats must not cause delay in entering or leaving the lock. Masters and pilots will be held to a strict accountability in this matter, and those with tows must provide enough men to move barges promptly. Boats failing to enter the lock with reasonable promptness after being signaled will lose their turn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tugboats arriving with their tows in a condition which will delay locking shall lose their turn if so ordered by the lock tender. Leaking boats may be excluded until put in shape to be passed through safely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Mooring. Boats in the lock or waiting in the entrance shall be moored where directed by the lock tender, by bow, stern, and spring lines, to the snubbing posts or line hooks. Tying boats to the lock ladders is strictly prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Protection of lock gates. Boats will not be permitted to enter or leave the lock until the lock gates are at rest in the gate recesses and the lock tender has directed the boat to start.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Damage to walls, etc. All craft passing through the lock must be free from projections or sharp corners which might scar the walls or injure other parts. Steamboats must be provided with suitable fenders, etc. One man shall be kept at the head of every tow till it has cleared the lock and guide walls, and shall use the fender to prevent scarring the walls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Handling machinery. None but employees of the United States will be allowed to move any valve, gate, or other machinery belonging to the lock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Refuse in lock. Throwing ashes, refuse, or other obstruction in the entrances or in the lock, or on the walls thereof, and passing coal from flats or barges to a steamboat while in the lock is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Trespass on U.S. property. Trespass on U.S. property, or willful injury to the banks, masonry, fences, trees, houses, machinery, or other property of the United States at or near the lock is strictly prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Penalties. In addition to the penalties prescribed by law, boats which fail to comply with the regulations in this section will thereafter be refused lockage until assurances have been received, satisfactory to the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, New York, New York, that the regulations will be complied with.
