equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A summary of the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime during the reporting period and the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime as a percent of the total source operating time during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A brief description of the process units.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A brief description of the continuous monitoring system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> The date of the latest continuous monitoring system certification or audit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. If you had a startup, shutdown, or malfunction during the semiannual reporting period that was not consistent with your startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, you must submit an immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report according to the requirements in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Part 70 monitoring report. If you have obtained a title V operating permit for an affected source pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, you must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If you submit a compliance report for an affected source along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report includes all the required information concerning deviations from any emissions limitation, work practice standards, or operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart, submission of the compliance report satisfies any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of the compliance report does not otherwise affect any obligation you may have to report deviations from permit requirements for an affected source to your permitting authority.</p>
