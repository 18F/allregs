                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A grant of parole is conditioned upon the approval of release  plans by the Regional Commissioner. In general, the following factors  are considered as elements in the prisoner's release plan:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Availability of legitimate employment and an approved residence  for the prospective parolee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Availability of necessary aftercare for a parolee who is ill or  who requires special care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, parolees will be released only to the place of their  legal residence unless the Commission is satisfied that another place of  residence will serve the public interest more effectively or will  improve the probability of the applicant's readjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the circumstances warrant, the Commission on its own  motion, or upon recommendation of the probation officer, may require  that an advisor who is a responsible, reputable, and law-abiding citizen  living in or near the community in which the releasee will reside be  available to the releasee.   Such advisor shall serve under the direction of and in cooperation with  the probation officer to whom the parolee is assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the prisoner has an unsatisfied fine or restitution order,  a reasonable plan for payment [or performance of services, if so ordered  by the court] shall, where feasible, be included in the parole release  plan.
