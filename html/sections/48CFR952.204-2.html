Except as otherwise expressly provided in

this contract, the Contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to DOE any classified matter or special nuclear material in the possession of the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract. If retention by the Contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract, the Contractor shall identify the items and classification levels and categories of matter proposed for retention, the reasons for the retention, and the proposed period of retention.

The term ''Formerly Restricted Data'' means information removed from the Restricted Data category based on a joint determination by DOE or its predecessor agencies and the Department of Defense that the information--(1) Relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons; and (2) can be adequately protected as National Security Information. However, such information is subject to the same restrictions on transmission to other countries or regional defense organizations that apply to Restricted Data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definition of national security information. The term ``National Security Information'' means information that has been determined, pursuant to Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or any predecessor order, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and that is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definition of special nuclear material.

Contractors are encouraged to submit this information through the use of the online tool at https://foci.td.anl.gov. When completed the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer.

In making this determination, DOE will consider proposals made by the Contractor to avoid or mitigate foreign influences.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the cognizant security office at any time determines that the Contractor is, or is potentially, subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence, the Contractor shall comply with such instructions as the Contracting Officer shall provide in writing to protect any classified information or special nuclear material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause or if the Contractor creates a foreign ownership, control, or influence situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the Contractor becomes subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the foreign ownership, control, or influence problem.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Employment announcements. When placing announcements seeking applicants for positions requiring access authorizations, the Contractor shall include in the written vacancy announcement, a notification to prospective applicants that reviews, and tests for the absence of any illegal drug as defined in 10 CFR 707.4, will be conducted by the employer and a background investigation by the Federal government may be required to obtain an access authorization prior to employment, and that subsequent reinvestigations may be required.
