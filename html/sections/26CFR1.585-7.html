                                Sec. 1.585-7  Elective cut-off method of changing from the reserve method
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maintaining reserve for pre-disqualification loans--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. A bank that makes the election allowed by paragraph (a) of this  section must maintain its bad debt reserve for its pre-disqualification  loans (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). Except as  provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the bank must charge  against the reserve the amount of any losses resulting from these loans  (including losses resulting from the sale or other disposition of these  loans), and the bank must add to the reserve the amount of recoveries  with respect to these loans. In general, the reserve must be maintained  in the manner provided by former section 166(c) of the Internal Revenue  Code and the regulations thereunder. However, after the balance in the  reserve is reduced to zero, the bank is to account for any losses and  recoveries with respect to outstanding pre-disqualification loans under  the specific charge-off method of accounting for bad debts, as if the  bank always had accounted for these loans under this method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definition of pre-disqualification loans. For purposes of this  section, a pre-disqualification loan of a bank is any loan that the bank  held on the last day of its taxable year immediately preceding its  disqualification year (as defined in Sec. 1.585-5(d)(1)). If the amount  of a pre-disqualification loan is increased during or after the  disqualification year, the amount of the increase is not treated as a  pre-disqualification loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> when a bank disposes of loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of disposing of loans--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, if a bank that makes  the election allowed by paragraph (a) of this section sells or otherwise  disposes of any of its outstanding pre-disqualification loans, the bank  is to reduce the balance of its outstanding pre-disqualification loans  by the amount of the loans disposed of, for purposes of applying  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acquiror completes cut-off method of change. Except as provided  in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the acquiror steps into the  shoes of the transferor in the section 381(a) transaction with respect  to using the cut-off method of change. Thus, the transferor's bad debt  reserve immediately before the section 381(a) transaction carries over  to the acquiror, and the acquiror must complete the cut-off method begun  by the transferor. For purposes of completing the transferor's cut-off  method, the acquiror's balance of outstanding pre-disqualification loans  immediately after the section   381(a) transaction is the balance of these loans that it receives in the  transaction, and the acquiror assumes all of the transferor's rights and  obligations under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii))</em> for all of  the loans received in the transaction exceeds the balance of the reserve  that carries over to the acquiror, the acquiror increases this balance  by the amount of the excess. Any such increase in the reserve results in  a negative section 481(a) adjustment that is taken into account as  required under section 381.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> does not apply to the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Bank M is a bank that properly elects to use the cut-off  method set forth in this Sec. 1.585-7. M's disqualification year is its  taxable year beginning on January 1, 1987. On December 31, 1986, M had  outstanding loans of $700 million (pre-disqualification loans), and the  balance in its bad debt reserve was $10 million. M must maintain its  reserve for its pre-disqualification loans in accordance with  Sec. 1.585-7(b), and it may not deduct any addition to this reserve for  taxable year 1987 or any later year. For these years, M may deduct  amounts allowed under section 166(a) for loans that it originates or  acquires after December 31, 1986, and that become worthless in whole or  in part.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Also assume that  in 1987 M collects $150 million of its pre- disqualification loans, M  determines that $2 million of its pre-disqualification loans are  worthless, and M recovers $1 million of pre-disqualification loans that  it had previously charged against the reserve as worthless. On December  31, 1987, the balance in M's bad debt reserve is $9 million ($10 million  - $2 million + $1 million), and the balance of its outstanding pre- disqualification loans is $548 million ($700 million - $150 million - $2  million).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Examples 1 and 2. Also assume  that on December 31, 1990, the balance in M's bad debt reserve is $5  million and the balance of its outstanding pre-disqualification loans is  $25 million. In 1991 M collects $21 million of its outstanding pre- disqualification loans and determines that $1 million of its outstanding  pre-disqualification loans are worthless. Thus, on December 31, 1991,  the balance in M's bad debt reserve is $4 million ($5 million - $1  million), and the balance of its outstanding pre-disqualification loans  is $3 million ($25 million - $21 million - $1 million). Accordingly, M  must include $1 million ($4 million - $3 million) in income in taxable  year 1991, pursuant to Sec. 1.585-7(c). On January 1, 1992, the balance  in M's reserve is $3 million ($4 million - $1 million).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Examples 1 through 3. Also  assume that in 1992 M transfers substantially all of its assets to  another corporation (N) in a transaction to which section 381(a)  applies, and N is treated as a large bank under Sec. 1.585-5(b)(2) for  taxable years ending after the date of the transaction. Pursuant to  Sec. 1.585-7(d)(2)(i), N steps into M's shoes with respect to using the  cut-   off method. M's bad debt reserve immediately before the section 381(a)  transaction carries over to N, and N must complete the cut-off procedure  begun by M. For this purpose, N's balance of outstanding pre- disqualification loans immediately after the section 381(a) transaction  is the balance of these loans that it receives from M.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Examples 1 through 4, except  that N is not treated as a large bank after the section 381(a)  transaction. Also assume that N uses the reserve method of section 585  and plans to use this method for all of the loans it acquires from M  (including loans that were not pre-disqualification loans). Pursuant to  Sec. 1.585-7(d)(2)(ii), M's bad debt reserve immediately before the  section 381(a) transaction carries over to N in the transaction;  however, N does not continue the cut-off procedure begun by M and does  not treat any loan as a pre-disqualification loan. If the six-year  moving average amount (as defined in Sec. 1.585-2(c)(1)(ii)) for all of  N's newly acquired loans exceeds the balance of the reserve that carries  over to N, N increases this balance by the amount of the excess. Any  such increase in the reserve results in a negative section 481(a)  adjustment that is taken into account as required under section 381.
