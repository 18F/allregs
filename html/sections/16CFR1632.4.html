                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Apparatus and Test Materials--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testroom. The testroom shall  be large enough to accommodate a full-scale mattress in a horizontal  position and to allow for free movement of personnel and air around the  test mattress. The test area shall be draft-protected and equipped with  a suitable system for exhausting smoke and/or noxious gases produced by  testing. The testroom atmospheric conditions shall be greater than 18  [deg]C (65 [deg]F) and at less than 55 percent relative humidity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The room shall be equipped with a support system (e.g. platform,  bench) upon which a mattress may be placed flat in a horizontal position  at a reasonable height for making observations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If thin flexible mattresses or mattress pads are being testing  the room shall also be equipped with a glass fiberboard test surface.  The glass fiberboard shall be approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick and  have a thermal conductivity of 0.300.05 cal (g) /  hr cm\2\ [deg]C/cm (0.240.04 Btu/hr ft\2\ [deg]F/ in) at 23.9 [deg]C (75 [deg]F). \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\1\ Glass fiberboard that meets Federal Specification HH-I-558B is  acceptable. Under this specification, the board must be Form A, Class 1,  and plain faced. Copies of the specifications may be obtained from the  Business Service Centers of the General Services Administration Regional  Offices. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ignition source. The ignition source shall be a Standard  Reference Material cigarette (SRM 1196), available for purchase from the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive,  Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fire extinguisher. A pressurized water fire extinguisher, or  other suitable fire extinguishing equipment, shall be immediately  available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Water bottle. A water bottle fitted with a spray nozzle shall be  used to extinguish the ignited portions of the mattress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Scale. A linear scale graduated in millimeters, 0.1 inch, or \1/ 16\ inch divisions shall be used to measure char length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sheets or Sheeting Material. White, 100 percent cotton sheets or  sheeting material shall be used. It shall not be   treated with a chemical finish which imparts a characteristic such as  permanent press or flame resistance. It shall have 120-210 threads per  square inch and fabric weight of 3.70.8 oz/yd\2\  (12528 gm/m\2\). The size of the sheet or sheeting  material shall be appropriate for the mattress being tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other apparatus. In addition to the above, a thermometer, a  relative humidity measuring instrument, a thin rod, straight pins, a  knife or scissors, and tongs are required to carry out the testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test preparation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mattress samples. The mattress shall be  removed from any packaging prior to conditioning. The mattress surface  shall be divided laterally into two sections (see fig. 1), one section  for the bare mattress tests and the other for the two-sheet tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sheets or sheeting material. The sheets or sheeting material  shall be laundered once before use in an automatic home washer using the  hot water setting and longest normal cycle with the manufacturer's  recommended quantity of a commercial detergent, and dried in an  automatic home tumble dryer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sheet shall be cut across the width into two equal parts  after washing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sheeting material shall be cut in lengths to cover \1/2\ of a  mattress as described in Sec. 1632.4(d)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cigarettes. Unopened packages of cigarettes shall be selected  for each series of tests. The cigarettes shall be removed from packaging  prior to conditioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditioning. The mattresses, laundered sheets or sheeting  material, and loose cigarettes shall be conditioned in air at a  temperature greater than 18 [deg]C (65 [deg]F) and a relative humidity  less than 55 percent for at least 48 continuous hours prior to test. The  mattresses, laundered sheets or sheeting material, and cigarettes shall  be supported in a suitable manner to permit free movement of air around  them during conditioning. The mattress meets this conditioning  requirement if the mattress and/or all its component materials, except  the metallic core, if present, have been exposed only to the above  temperature and humidity conditions for at least 48 continuous hours  prior to testing the mattress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Testing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Mattress specimens shall be tested in a  testroom with atmospheric conditions of a temperature greater than 18  [deg]C (65 [deg]F) and a relative humidity less than 55 percent. If the  test is not performed in the conditioning room, at least one lit  cigarette shall be placed on the mattress surface within 10 minutes of  removal from the conditioning room. The other side of the mattress shall  be tested immediately after completion of the first side.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 18 cigarettes shall be burned on each mattress test  surface, 9 in the bare mattress tests and 9 in the 2-sheet tests. If  three or more mattress surface locations (smooth surface, tape edge,  quilted, or tufted areas) exist in the particular mattress surface under  test, three cigarettes shall be burned on each different surface  location. If only two mattress surface locations exist in the particular  mattress surface under test (tape edge and smooth surface), four  cigarettes shall be burned on the smooth surface and five cigarettes  shall be burned on the tape edge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light and place one cigarette at a time on the mattress  surface. (If previous experience with a similar type of mattress has  indicated that ignition is not likely, the number of cigarettes which  may be lighted and placed on the mattress at one time is left to the  test operator's judgment. The number of cigarettes must be carefully  considered because a smoldering or burning mattress is extremely  hazardous and difficult to extinguish.) The cigarettes must be  positioned no less than 6 inches apart on the mattress surface. Each  cigarette used as an ignition source shall be well lighted but not  burned more than 4 mm (0.16 inch) when placed on the mattress. (Fire  extinguishing equipment must be readily available at all times.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a cigarette extinguishes before burning its full length on  any mattress surface location, pops out of position when tested on a  tuft, or rolls off a test location, the test must be repeated with a  freshly lit cigarette on a different portion of the same type of  location on the mattress surface until either: the number of cigarettes  specified   in Sec. 1632.4(d)(1)(i) have burned their full lengths; the number of  cigarettes specified in Sec. 1632.4(d)(1)(i) have extinguished before  burning their full lengths; or failure has occurred according to Sec.  1632.3(b) Test criterion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bare mattress tests--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Smooth surface. Each burning cigarette  shall be placed directly on a smooth surface location on the test  surface on the half reserved for bare mattress tests. The cigarettes  should burn their full lengths on a smooth surface without burning  across a tuft, or stitching of a quilted area. However, if this is not  possible because of mattress design, then the cigarettes shall be  positioned on the mattress in a manner which will allow as much of the  butt ends as possible to burn on smooth surfaces. Report results for  each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test criterion (see  Sec. 1632.3(b)). CAUTION: Even under the most carefully observed  conditions, smoldering combustion can progress to the point where it  cannot be readily extinguished. It is imperative that a test be  discontinued as soon as ignition has definitely occurred. Immediately  wet the exposed area with a water spray (from water bottle), cut around  the burning material with a knife or scissors and pull the material out  of the mattress with tongs. Make sure that all charred or burned  material is removed. Ventilate the room.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tape edge. Each burning cigarette shall be placed in the  depression between the mattress top surface and the tape edge, parallel  to the tape edge of the half of the test surface reserved for bare  mattress tests. If there is only a seam or no depression at the edge,  support the cigarettes in place along the edge and parallel to the edge  with straight pins. Three straight pins may be inserted through the edge  at a 45[deg] angle such that one pin supports the cigarette at the  burned end, one at the center, and one at the butt. The heads of the  pins must be below the upper surface of the cigarette (see fig. 2).  Report results for each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test  criterion (see Sec. 1632.3(b)). [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.097     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.098</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Quilted location. If quilting exists on the test surface, each  burning cigarette shall be placed on quilted locations of the test  surface. The cigarettes shall be positioned directly over the thread or  in the depression created by the quilting process on the half of the  test surface reserved for bare mattress tests. If the quilt design is  such that the cigarettes cannot burn their full lengths over the thread  or depression, then the cigarettes shall be positioned in a manner which  will allow as much of the butt ends as possible to burn on the thread or  depression. Report results for each cigarette as pass or fail as defined  in the test criterion (see Sec. 1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tufted location. If tufting exists on the test surface, each  burning cigarette shall be placed on tufted locations of the test  surface. The cigarettes shall be positioned so that they burn down into  the depression caused by the tufts and so that the butt ends of the  cigarettes burn out over the buttons or laces used in the tufts or the  depressions made by the tufts on the half of the test surface reserved  for bare mattress tests. Report results for each cigarette as pass or  fail as defined in the test criterion (see Sec. 1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two-sheet tests. Spread a section of sheet or sheeting material  smoothly over the mattress surface which has been reserved for the two- sheet test and tuck under the mattress. Care must be taken that hems or  any other portion of the sheet which is more than one fabric thickness,  is neither directly under nor directly over the test cigarette in the  two-sheet test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Smooth surfaces. Each burning cigarette shall be placed directly  on the sheet covered mattress in a smooth surface location as defined in  the bare mattress test. Immediately cover the first sheet and the  burning cigarette loosely with a second, or top sheet (see fig. 2). Do  not raise or lift the top sheet during testing unless obvious ignition  has occurred or until the cigarette has burned out. Whether a cigarette  has extinguished may be determined by holding the hand near the surface  of the top sheet over the test location. If no heat is felt or smoke  observed, the cigarette has burned out. If ignition occurs, immediately  remove the sheets and cigarette and follow the cautionary procedures  outlined in the bare mattress test. Report results for each cigarette as  pass or fail as defined in the test criterion (see Sec. 1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tape edge. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each burning cigarette shall be placed in the  depression between the top surface and the tape edge on top of the  sheet, and immediately covered with a second sheet. It is important the  air space be eliminated, as much as possible, between the mattress and  the bottom sheet at the test location before testing. Depress the bottom  sheet into the depression using a thin rod or other suitable instrument.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In most cases, the cigarettes will remain in place throughout  the test. However, if the cigarettes show a marked tendency to roll off  the tape edge location, they may be supported with straight pins. Three  straight pins may be inserted through the bottom sheet and tape at a  45[deg] angle such that one pin supports the cigarette at the burning  end, one at the center, and one at the butt. The heads of the pins must  be below the upper surface of the cigarette (see fig. 2). Report results  for each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test criterion (see  Sec. 1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Quilted locations. If quilting exists on the test surface,  each burning cigarette shall be placed in a depression caused by  quilting, directly over the thread and on the bottom sheet, and  immediately covered with the top sheet. It is important that the air  space be eliminated, as much as possible, between the mattress and the  bottom sheet at the test location before testing. Depress the bottom  sheet into the depression using a thin rod or other suitable instrument.  If the quilt design is such that the cigarettes cannot burn their full  lengths over the thread or depression, then the cigarettes shall be  positioned in a manner which will allow as much of the butt ends as  possible to burn on the thread or depression. Report results for each  cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test criterion (see Sec.  1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tufted locations. If tufting exists on the test surface, each  burning cigarette shall be placed in the depression caused by tufting,  directly over the tuft and on the bottom sheet, and immediately covered  with the top sheet. It is important that the air space be eliminated, as  much as possible, between the mattress and the bottom sheet at the test  location before testing. Depress the bottom sheet into the depression  using a thin rod or other suitable instrument. The cigarettes shall be  positioned so that they burn down into the depression caused by the tuft  and so that the butt ends of the cigarettes burn out over the buttons or  laces, if used in the tufts. Report results for each cigarette as pass  or fail as defined in the test criterion (see Sec. 1632.3(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records. Records of all prototype test results, and the  disposition of rejected prototypes shall be maintained by the person or  firm required to perform testing by the standard in accordance with  Sec. 1632.31(c).
