                                Sec. 780.145  The relationship is determined by consideration

                            <p class="depth0">The character of a practice as a part of the agricultural activity  or as a distinct business activity must be determined by examination and  evaluation of all the relevant facts and circumstances in the light of  the pertinent language and intent of the Act. The result will not depend  on any mechanical application of isolated factors or tests. Rather, the  total situation will control (Maneja v. Waialua, 349 U.S. 254; Mitchell  v. Budd, 350 U.S. 473). Due weight should be given to any available  criteria which may indicate whether performance of such a practice may  properly be considered an incident to farming within the intent of the  Act. Thus, the general relationship, if any, of the practice to farming  as evidenced by common understanding, competitive factors, and the  prevalence of its performance by farmers (see Sec. 780.146), and  similar pertinent matters should be considered. Other factors to be  considered in determining whether a practice may be properly regarded as  incidental to or in conjunction with the farming operations of a  particular farmer or farm include the size of the operations and  respective sums invested in land, buildings and equipment for the  regular farming operations and in plant and equipment for performance of  the practice, the amount of the payroll for each type of work, the  number of employees and the amount of time they spend in each of the  activities, the extent to which the practice is performed by ordinary  farm employees and the amount of interchange of employees between the  operations, the amount of revenue derived from each activity, the degree  of industrialization involved, and the degree of separation established  between the activities. With respect to practices performed on farm  products (see Sec. 780.147) and in the consideration of any specific  practices (see Sec. Sec. 780.148-780.158 and 780.205-780.214), there  may be special factors in addition to those above mentioned which may  aid in the determination.</p>
