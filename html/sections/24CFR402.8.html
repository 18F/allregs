                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of termination. An owner who is not eligible for a  Restructuring Plan under part 401 of this chapter, or who is eligible  but does not request restructuring, and who does not renew a contract,  must provide one year's notice to tenants, to HUD, and to the contract  administrator as provided in section 8(c)(8)(A) of the United States  Housing Act of 1937.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an owner does not give timely notice. If an owner does not  give one year's notice of termination as described in paragraph (a) of  this section, the owner must permit the tenants in assisted units to  remain in their units at a rental rate no higher than the tenant rent  payable for the tenants' last month of assisted occupancy under the  terminated HAP contract until one year after notice is given, even if  HUD does not continue to make housing assistance payments with respect  to such units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an owner opts out or fails to renew. In the case where a  contract for Section 8 rental assistance for a project is terminated or  expires, an assisted family may elect to remain in   the project and, if eligible, receive tenant-based Section 8 assistance  under Section 8(t) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
