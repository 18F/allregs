                            <p class="depth0">Amplitude modulation (AM). A system of modulation in which the envelope of the transmitted wave contains a component similar to the wave form of the signal to be transmitted.</p><p class="depth0">Antenna electrical beam tilt. The shaping of the radiation pattern in the vertical plane of a transmitting antenna by electrical means so that maximum radiation occurs at an angle below the horizontal plane.</p><p class="depth0">Antenna height above average terrain. The average of the antenna heights above the terrain from approximately 3.2 (2 miles) to 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) from the antenna for the eight directions spaced evenly for each 45 degrees of azimuth starting with True North. (In general, a different antenna height will be determined in each direction from the antenna. The average of these various heights is considered the antenna height above the average terrain. In some cases less than 8 directions may be used. See Sec.  73.684(d)). Where circular or elliptical polarization is employed, the antenna height above average terrain shall be based upon the height of the radiation center of the antenna which transmits the horizontal component of radiation.</p><p class="depth0">Antenna mechanical beam tilt. The intentional installation of a transmitting antenna so that its axis is not vertical, in order to change the normal angle of maximum radiation in the vertical plane.</p><p class="depth0">Antenna power gain. The square of the ratio of the root-mean-square free space field strength produced at 1 kilometer in the horizontal plane, in

millivolts per meter for one kW antenna input power to 221.4 mV/m. This ratio should be expressed in decibels (dB). (If specified for a particular direction, antenna power gain is based on the field strength in that direction only.)</p><p class="depth0">Aspect ratio.

An auxiliary facility is an antenna separate a from the main facility's antenna, permanently installed on the same tower or at a different location, from which a station may broadcast for short periods without prior Commission authorization or notice to the Commission while the main facility is not in operation (e.g., where tower work necessitates turning off the main antenna or where lightning has caused damage to the main antenna or transmission system) (See Sec.  73.1675).</p><p class="depth2">BTSC.

The product of the antenna input power and the antenna power gain. This product should be expressed in kW and in dB above 1 kW (dBk). (If specified for a particular direction, effective radiated power is based on the antenna power gain in that direction only. The licensed effective radiated power is based on the maximum antenna power gain. When a station is authorized to use a directional antenna or an antenna beam tilt, the direction of the maximum effective radiated power will be specified.) Where circular or elliptical polarization is employed, the term effective radiated power is applied separately to the horizontally and vertically polarized components of radiation. For assignment purposes, only the effective radiated power authorized for the horizontally polarized component will be considered.</p><p class="depth2">Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP). The term ``equivalent isotropically radiated power'' (also known as ``effective radiated power above isotropic'') means the product of the antenna input power and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna.</p><p class="depth2">Field. Scanning through the picture area once in the chosen scanning pattern. In the line interlaced scanning pattern of two to one, the scanning of the alternate lines of the picture area once.</p><p class="depth2">Frame. Scanning all of the picture area once. In the line interlaced scanning pattern of two to one, a frame consists of two fields.</p><p class="depth2">Free space field strength. The field strength that would exist at a point in the absence of waves reflected from the earth or other reflecting objects.</p><p class="depth2">Frequency departure.

The peak difference between the maximum and the minimum values of the instantaneous frequency of the carrier wave during modulation.</p><p class="depth2">Interlaced scanning. A scanning process in which successively scanned lines are spaced an integral number of line widths, and in which the adjacent lines are scanned during successive cycles of the field frequency.</p><p class="depth2">IRE standard scale. A linear scale for measuring, in IRE units, the relative amplitudes of the components of a television signal from a zero reference at blanking level, with picture information falling in the positive, and synchronizing information in the negative domain.</p><p class="depth2">Note: When a carrier is amplitude modulated by a television signal in accordance with Sec.  73.682, the relationship of the IRE standard scale to the conventional measure of modulation is as follows:
