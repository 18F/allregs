                            <p class="depth0">The State plan shall provide that the following requirements and  criteria to bond employees are in effect:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> IV-D responsibility. The IV-D agency will insure that every  person, who has access to or control over funds collected under the  child support enforcement program, is covered by a bond against loss  resulting from employee dishonesty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies  to every person who, as a regular part of his or her employment,  receives, disburses, handles or has access to support collections, which  includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> IV-D agency employees and employees of any other State or local  agency to which IV-D functions have been delegated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees of a court or law enforcement official performing  under a cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employees of any private or governmental entity from which the  IV-D agency purchases services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bond. The bond will be for an amount which the State IV-D agency  deems adequate to indemnify the State IV-D program for loss resulting  from employee dishonesty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Self-bonding System. A State or political subdivision may comply  with the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By means of a self-bonding system established under State law  or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a political subdivision, by means of a self- bonding system approved by the State IV-D agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> IV-D liability. The requirements of this section do not reduce  or limit the ultimate liability of the IV-D agency for losses of support  collections from the State's IV-D program.
