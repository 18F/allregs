                            <p class="depth0">Qualified facilities meeting the Tier I applicability criteria in  Sec. 112.3(g)(1) are subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of  this section. Qualified facilities meeting the Tier II applicability  criteria in Sec. 112.3(g)(2) are subject to the requirements in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tier I Qualified Facilities--(1) Preparation and Self- Certification of the Plan. If you are an owner or operator of a facility  that meets the Tier I qualified facility criteria in Sec. 112.3(g)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  you must either: comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of  this section; or prepare and implement a Plan meeting requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section; or prepare and implement a Plan meeting  the general Plan requirements in Sec. 112.7 and applicable requirements  in subparts B and C, including having the Plan certified by a  Professional Engineer as required under Sec. 112.3(d). If you do not  follow the appendix G template, you must prepare an equivalent Plan that  meets all of the applicable requirements listed in this part, and you  must supplement it with a section cross-referencing the location of  requirements listed in this part and the equivalent requirements in the  other prevention plan. To complete the template in appendix G, you must  certify that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are familiar with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part  112;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You have visited and examined the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You prepared the Plan in accordance with accepted and sound  industry practices and standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You have established procedures for required inspections and  testing in accordance with industry inspection and testing standards or  recommended practices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You will fully implement the Plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The facility meets the qualification criteria in Sec.  112.3(g)(1);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The Plan does not deviate from any requirement of this part as  allowed by Sec. 112.7(a)(2) and 112.7(d) or include measures pursuant  to Sec. 112.9(c)(6) for produced water containers and any associated  piping; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The Plan and individual(s) responsible for implementing this  Plan have the approval of management, and the facility owner or operator  has committed the necessary resources to fully implement this Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical Amendments. You must certify any technical amendments  to your Plan in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section when  there is a change in the facility design, construction, operation, or  maintenance that affects its potential for a discharge as described in  Sec. 112.1(b). If the facility change results in the facility no longer  meeting the Tier I qualifying criteria in Sec. 112.3(g)(1) because an  individual oil storage container capacity exceeds 5,000 U.S. gallons or  the facility capacity exceeds 10,000 U.S. gallons in aggregate  aboveground storage capacity, within six months following preparation of  the amendment, you must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prepare and implement a Plan in accordance with Sec. 112.6(b)  if you meet the Tier II qualified facility criteria in Sec.  112.3(g)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prepare and implement a Plan in accordance with the general  Plan requirements in Sec. 112.7, and applicable requirements in  subparts B and C, including having the Plan certified by a Professional  Engineer as required under Sec. 112.3(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, 112.12(c)(4), 112.12(c)(5),  112.12(c)(6), 112.12(c)(10), and 112.12(d)(4). The template in appendix  G to this part has been developed to meet the requirements of 40 CFR  part 112 and, when completed and signed by the owner or operator, may be  used as the SPCC Plan. Additionally, you must meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure analysis, in lieu of the requirements in Sec. 112.7(b).  Where experience indicates a reasonable potential for equipment failure  (such as loading or unloading equipment, tank overflow, rupture, or  leakage, or any other equipment known to be a source of discharge),  include in your Plan a prediction of the direction and total quantity of  oil which could be discharged from the facility as a result of each type  of major equipment failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bulk storage container secondary containment, in lieu of the  requirements in Sec. Sec. 112.8(c)(2) and (c)(11) and 112.12(c)(2) and  (c)(11). Construct all bulk storage container installations (except  mobile refuelers and other non-transportation-related tank trucks),  including mobile or portable oil storage containers, so that you provide  a secondary means of containment for the entire capacity of the largest  single container plus additional capacity to contain precipitation.  Dikes, containment curbs, and pits are commonly employed for this  purpose. You may also use an alternative system consisting of a drainage  trench enclosure that must be arranged so that any discharge will  terminate and be safely confined in a catchment basin or holding pond.  Position or locate mobile or portable oil storage containers to prevent  a discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Overfill prevention, in lieu of the requirements in Sec. Sec.  112.8(c)(8) and 112.12(c)(8). Ensure that each container is provided  with a system or documented procedure to prevent overfills of the  container, describe the system or procedure in the SPCC Plan and  regularly test to ensure proper operation or efficacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tier II Qualified Facilities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preparation and Self- Certification of Plan. If you are the owner or operator of a facility  that meets the Tier II qualified facility criteria in Sec. 112.3(g)(2),  you may choose to self-certify your Plan. You must certify in the Plan  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are familiar with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You have visited and examined the facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Plan has been prepared in accordance with accepted and  sound industry practices and standards, and with the requirements of  this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Procedures for required inspections and testing have been  established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You will fully implement the Plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The facility meets the qualification criteria set forth under  Sec. 112.3(g)(2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The Plan does not deviate from any requirement of this part as  allowed by Sec. 112.7(a)(2) and 112.7(d) or include measures pursuant  to Sec. 112.9(c)(6) for produced water containers and any associated  piping, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The Plan and individual(s) responsible for implementing the  Plan have the full approval of management and the facility owner or  operator has committed the necessary resources to fully implement the  Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical Amendments. If you self-certify your Plan pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must certify any technical  amendments to your Plan in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this  section when there is a change in the facility design, construction,  operation, or maintenance that affects its potential for a discharge as  described in Sec. 112.1(b), except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a Professional Engineer certified a portion of your Plan in  accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the technical  amendment affects this portion of the Plan, you must have the amended  provisions of your Plan certified by a Professional Engineer in  accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the change is such that the facility no longer meets the  Tier II qualifying criteria in Sec. 112.3(g)(2) because it exceeds  10,000 U.S. gallons in aggregate aboveground storage capacity you   must, within six months following the change, prepare and implement a  Plan in accordance with the general Plan requirements in Sec. 112.7 and  the applicable requirements in subparts B and C of this part, including  having the Plan certified by a Professional Engineer as required under  Sec. 112.3(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicable Requirements. Except as provided in this paragraph,  your self-certified SPCC Plan must comply with Sec. 112.7 and the  applicable requirements in subparts B and C of this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Environmental Equivalence. Your Plan may not include alternate  methods which provide environmental equivalence pursuant to Sec.  112.7(a)(2), unless each alternate method has been reviewed and  certified in writing by a Professional Engineer, as provided in  paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Impracticability. Your Plan may not include any determinations  that secondary containment is impracticable and provisions in lieu of  secondary containment pursuant to Sec. 112.7(d), unless each such  determination and alternate measure has been reviewed and certified in  writing by a Professional Engineer, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Produced Water Containers. Your Plan may not include any  alternative procedures for skimming produced water containers in lieu of  sized secondary containment pursuant to Sec. 112.9(c)(6), unless they  have been reviewed and certified in writing by a Professional Engineer,  as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Professional Engineer Certification of Portions of a Qualified  Facility's Self-Certified Plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the facility  owner or operator may not self-certify alternative measures allowed  under Sec. 112.7(a)(2) or (d), that are included in the facility's  Plan. Such measures must be reviewed and certified, in writing, by a  licensed Professional Engineer. For each alternative measure allowed  under Sec. 112.7(a)(2), the Plan must be accompanied by a written  statement by a Professional Engineer that states the reason for  nonconformance and describes the alternative method and how it provides  equivalent environmental protection in accordance with Sec.  112.7(a)(2). For each determination of impracticability of secondary  containment pursuant to Sec. 112.7(d), the Plan must clearly explain  why secondary containment measures are not practicable at this facility  and provide the alternative measures required in Sec. 112.7(d) in lieu  of secondary containment. By certifying each measure allowed under Sec.  112.7(a)(2) and (d), the Professional Engineer attests:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That he is familiar with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That he or his agent has visited and examined the facility; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> That the alternative method of environmental equivalence in  accordance with Sec. 112.7(a)(2) or the determination of  impracticability and alternative measures in accordance with Sec.  112.7(d) is consistent with good engineering practice, including  consideration of applicable industry standards, and with the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the facility  owner or operator may not self-certify measures as described in Sec.  112.9(c)(6) for produced water containers and any associated piping.
