                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2736 (Act of September 8, 1961 (75 Stat. 488)) as amended by Public Law 90-521 (82 Stat. 874); Public Law 98-564 (90 Stat. 2919); and Public Law 100-465 (102 Stat. 2005)). No new liability is created by 10 U.S.C. 2736, which merely permits partial advance payments, only under subparts C, F or J of this part, on claims not yet filed. See AR 27-20, paragraph 11-18 for information on emergency partial payments in personnel claims, which are not governed by 10 U.S.C. 2736.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) and the Assistant Judge Advocate General (TAJAG) may make advance payments in amounts not exceeding $100,000; the Commander USARCS, in amounts not exceeding $25,000, and the authorities designated in Sec. Sec. 536.786(4) and (5) and 536.101, in amounts not exceeding $10,000, subject to advance coordination with USARCS, if the estimated total value of the claim exceeds their monetary authority. Requests for advance payments in excess of $10,000 will be forwarded to USARCS for processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under subpart J of this part, three-member foreign claims commissions may make advance payments under the FCA in amounts not exceeding $10,000, subject to advance coordination with USARCS if the estimated total value of the claim exceeds their monetary authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An advance payment, not exceeding $100,000, is authorized in the limited category of claims or potential claims considered meritorious under subparts C, F or J of this part, that result in immediate hardship. An advance payment is authorized only under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claim, or potential claim, must be determined to be cognizable and meritorious under the provisions of subparts C, F or J of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An immediate need for food, clothing, shelter, medical or burial expenses, or other necessities exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The payee, so far as can be determined, would be a proper claimant, including an incapacitated claimant's spouse or next-of-kin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The total damage sustained must exceed the amount of the advance payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A properly executed advance payment acceptance agreement has been obtained. This acceptance agreement must state that it does not constitute an admission of liability by the United States and that the amount paid shall be deducted from any subsequent award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There is no statutory authority for making advance payments for claims payable under subparts D or H of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.61: For further discussion see DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 2-71.</p>
