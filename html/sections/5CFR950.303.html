                                Sec. 950.303  Local federations eligibility.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> LFCC's must approve local federations that meet the applicable  requirements, except that in order to determine whether the LFCC must  recognize a local federation, the LFCC may request evidence of  corrective action regarding any prior violation of regulation or  directive, sanction, or penalty, as appropriate. A local federation that  has been notified that it will not be included on the Local part of the  Charity List because of failure to correct a prior violation may appeal  the LFCC's decision to the Director in accordance with Sec. 950.205(b).  The Director retains the ultimate authority to decide whether the local  federation has demonstrated, to the Director's satisfaction, that the  local federation has taken appropriate corrective action. Failure to  demonstrate satisfactory corrective action or to respond to a request by  the LFCC or Director for information within 10 business days of the date  of the request may result in a determination that the local federation  will not be included in the Local part of the Charity List.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By applying for inclusion in the CFC, federations consent to  allow the LFCC and Director complete access to it and its members' CFC  books and records and to respond to requests for information by the LFCC  and the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An organization may apply to the LFCC for inclusion as a local  federation to participate in the CFC if the applicant has as members of  the proposed federation 15 or more charitable organizations, in addition  to the federation itself, that meet the eligibility criteria of  Sec. Sec. 950.202, 950.203 and 950.204. The initial year an  organization applies for federation status, it must submit to the LFCC  applications of all its proposed member organizations in addition to the  federation application. A federation must re-establish eligibility   each year, however only the applications of its new and former members  that were not within the federation, as a CFC participant, in the  previous year's campaign need accompany the annual federation  application once an organization has obtained federation status, unless  additional member applications are requested by the LFCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After an organization has been granted federation status, it may  certify that its member organizations meet all eligibility criteria of  Sec. Sec. 950.202, 950.203, and 950.204 to be included on the Local  List. While deference should be given to federation certifications, the  LFCC, during the review process, may request independent evidence of  individual member organization's eligibility. Federation status in a  prior campaign is not a guarantee of federation status in a subsequent  campaign. Failure to meet minimum federation eligibility requirements  shall not be deemed to be a withdrawal of federation status subject to a  hearing on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An applicant for local federation status must certify and/or  demonstrate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That all member organizations seeking participation in the CFC  are qualified for inclusion on the Local List and provide a complete  list of those member organizations it certified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That it meets the eligibility requirements contained in Sec.  950.204 (including eligibility requirements and public accountability  standards of Sec. Sec. 950.202 and 950.203 that are incorporated by  reference). The federation can demonstrate that it has met the  eligibility requirement in Sec. 950.204(b)(1) either through its own  services, benefits, assistance or program activities or through its 15  members' activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The federation must complete the certification set forth at  Sec. 950.203(a)(2) without regard to the amount of revenue reported on  its IRS Form 990 and must provide a copy of its audited financial  statements. The audited financial statements provided must verify that  the federation is honoring designations made to each member organization  by distributing a proportionate share of receipts based on donor  designations to each member. The audit requirement is waived for newly  created federations operating for less than a year as determined from  the date of its IRS tax-exemption letter to the closing date of the CFC  application period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The federation must provide a listing of its board of  directors, beginning and ending dates of each member's current term of  office, and the board's meeting dates and locations for the year prior  to the year of the campaign for which the organization is applying.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The federation must certify that it prepares and makes  available to the public, upon request, an annual report that includes a  full description of the organization's activities and supporting  services and identifies its directors and chief administrative  personnel. The federation must provide a copy of its most recently  completed annual report covering the fiscal year ending not more than 18  months prior to January of the campaign year to which the federation is  applying or the preceding calendar year. The annual report must also  include an accurate description of the federation's membership dues and/ or service charges received by the federation from the charitable  organizations participating as members. The information must clearly  present the amounts raised, the sources of contributions, the cost of  fundraising, and how costs are recovered from donations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That is does not employ, in its CFC operations, the services of  private consultants, consulting firms, advertising agencies or similar  business organizations to perform the policy-making or decision-making  functions in the CFC. It may, however, contract with entities or  individuals such as banks, accountants, lawyers, and other vendors of  goods and/or services to assist in accomplishing its administrative  tasks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The LFCC will notify a federation if it is determined that the  federation does not meet the eligibility requirements of this section. A  federation may appeal an adverse eligibility decision in accordance with  Sec. 950.205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Director may waive any eligibility criteria for federation  status if it   is determined that such a waiver will be in the best interest of the  CFC.
