                                Sec. 404.281  Why your primary insurance amount may be recomputed.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Earnings not included in earlier computation or recomputation.  The most common reason for recomputing your primary insurance amount is  to include earnings of yours that were not used in the first computation  or in an earlier recomputation, as described in paragraphs (c) through  (e) of this section. These earnings will result in a revised average  monthly wage or revised average indexed monthly earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New computation method enacted. If a new method of computing or  recomputing primary insurance amounts is enacted into law and you are  eligible to have your primary insurance amount recomputed under the new  method, we will recompute it under the new method if doing so would  increase your primary insurance amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Earnings in the year you reach age 62 or become disabled. In the  initial computation of your primary insurance amount, we do not use your  earnings in the year you become entitled to old-age insurance benefits  or become disabled. However, we can use those earnings (called lag  earnings) in a recomputation of your primary insurance amount. We  recompute and begin paying you the higher benefits in the year after the  year you become entitled to old-age benefits or become disabled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Earnings not reported to us in time to use them in the  computation of your primary insurance amount. Because of the way reports  of earnings are required to be submitted to us for years after 1977, the  earnings you have in the year before you become entitled to old-age  insurance benefits, or become disabled or in the year you die might not  be reported to us in time to use them in computing your primary  insurance amount. We recompute your primary insurance amount based on  the new earnings information and begin paying you (or your survivors)  the higher benefits based on the additional earnings, beginning with the  month you became entitled or died.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Earnings after entitlement that are used in a recomputation.  Earnings that you have after you become entitled to benefits will be  used in a recomputation of your primary insurance amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Entitlement to a monthly pension. We will recompute your primary  insurance amount if in a month after you became entitled to old-age or  disability insurance benefits, you become entitled to a pension based on  noncovered employment, as explained in Sec. 404.213. Further, we will  recompute your primary insurance amount after your death to disregard a  monthly pension based on noncovered employment which affected your  primary insurance amount.
