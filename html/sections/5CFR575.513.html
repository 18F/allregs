                                Sec. 575.513  What are the agency's and the employee's obligations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section does not apply when an employee is involuntarily  separated or involuntarily reassigned to a position outside the  particular territory, possession, or commonwealth involved, as provided  in Sec. 575.511 or when an agency unilaterally terminates a service  agreement under Sec. 575.512.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, an employee  is indebted to the Federal Government and must repay the paying agency  for an appropriate portion of an extended assignment incentive received  by the employee if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee fails to complete the period of employment required  in his or her service agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee violates any other condition specified in the  service agreement that would trigger termination of the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an employee does not fulfill the terms of a service  agreement under the circumstances prescribed in paragraph (b) of this  section and has received incentive payments whose value as a percentage  of the planned total sum of incentive payments for the entire service  period exceeds the percentage reflecting the portion of the service  period completed by the employee, he or she must repay the excess  payment and any additional repayment penalty imposed by the agency under  paragraph (e) of this section, except when an authorized agency official  waives the requirement to repay the excess amount under paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For example, consider an employee who signed a 364-day (26 pay  period) service agreement and received the full amount of the extended  assignment incentive as an initial lump-sum payment. If the employee  voluntarily leaves after 20 pay periods (280 days), the employee will  have received 100 percent of the total extended assignment incentive  while completing only 76.9 percent (280/364) of the service period. The  excess is 23.1 percent. Therefore, the employee must repay 23.1 percent  (84/364) of the incentive. The employee is entitled to keep 76.9 percent  of the incentive, unless the agency imposes an additional repayment  penalty for failure to fulfill the service agreement under paragraph (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an employee does not fulfill the terms of the service  agreement under the circumstances prescribed in paragraph (b) of this  section and has received incentive payments whose value as a percentage  of the planned total sum of incentive payments for the entire service  period is less than or equal to the percentage reflecting the portion of  the service period completed by the employee, the employee has no  repayment obligation unless the agency imposes an additional repayment  penalty under paragraph (e) of this section. The agency may pay an  additional incentive payment for some or all of the service completed by  the employee if such additional payment is required by the service  agreement. The total amount of incentive payments received by the  employee may not exceed the prorated share of the planned incentive  attributable to completed service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For example, consider an employee who signed a 364-day (26 pay  period) service agreement to receive a total extended assignment payment  of $24,501 in two equal installment payments--i.e., $12,250.50 at the  end of 13 pay periods of completed service and $12,250.50 at the end of  the required service period. If the employee voluntarily leaves after 20  pay periods (280 days), the employee will have received   only 50 percent of the total extended assignment incentive while  completing 76.9 percent (280/364) of the service agreement. The agency  may pay the employee an additional amount of up to 26.9 percent of the  incentive payment that is attributable to completed service, as allowed  under the terms of the service agreement, assuming the agency does not  impose an additional repayment penalty for failure to fulfill the  service period under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An agency may impose an additional repayment penalty on an  employee who does not fulfill the terms of a service agreement. This  repayment penalty is in addition to any repayment required by paragraph  (c) of this section. The specific terms and conditions governing the  repayment penalty must be included in the service agreement. For  example, an agency may adopt a schedule or formula that provides for  varying penalty amounts based on the portion of the service period  completed by the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an employee fails to reimburse the paying agency for the full  amount owed under this section, the amount outstanding must be recovered  from the employee under the agency's regulations for collection by  offset from an indebted Government employee under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5  CFR part 550, subpart K, or through the appropriate provisions for debt  collection if the individual is no longer a Federal employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If an employee received extended assignment incentive payments  in excess of the amount that would be attributable to the completed  portion of the service period under paragraph (c) of this section, an  authorized agency official may waive the requirement to repay the excess  amount when, in the judgment of the official, collection of the excess  amount would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best  interest of the United States.
