For example, direct  costs include 116% of the salary of the employee performing work and the  actual costs incurred while operating equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duplicate means the process of making a copy of a document. Such  copies may take the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or  machine-readable documentation.
