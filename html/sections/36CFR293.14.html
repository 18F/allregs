No person shall have any right or interest in or to any mineral deposits which may be discovered through prospecting or other information-gathering activity after the legal date on which the laws pertaining to mineral leasing cease to apply to the specific Wilderness, nor shall any person after such date have any preference in applying for a mineral lease, license, or permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mineral leases, permits, and licenses covering lands within National Forest Wilderness will contain reasonable stipulations for the protection of the wilderness character of the land consistent with the use of the land for purposes for which they are leased, permitted, or licensed. The Chief, Forest Service, shall specify the conditions to be included in such stipulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permits shall not be issued for the removal of mineral materials commonly known as common varieties under the Minerals Act of July 31, 1947, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 601-604).
