The term acquiring Agency means a State Agency, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, which has the authority to acquire property by eminent domain under State law, and a State Agency or person which does not have such authority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Displacing Agency. The term displacing Agency means any Federal Agency carrying out a program or project, and any State, State Agency, or person carrying out a program or project with Federal financial assistance, which causes a person to be a displaced person.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Federal Agency. The term Federal Agency means any department, Agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch of the government, any wholly owned government corporation, the Architect of the Capitol, the Federal Reserve Banks and branches thereof, and any person who has the authority to acquire property by eminent domain under Federal law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State Agency. The term State Agency means any department, Agency or instrumentality of a State or of a political subdivision of a State, any department, Agency, or instrumentality of two or more States or of two or more political subdivisions of a State or States, and any person who has the authority to acquire property by eminent domain under State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alien not lawfully present in the United States. The phrase ``alien not lawfully present in the United States'' means an alien who is not ``lawfully present'' in the United States as defined in 8 CFR 103.12 and includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and whose stay in the United States has not been authorized by the United States Attorney General; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who is present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the United States Attorney General or who otherwise violates the terms and conditions of admission, parole or authorization to stay in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appraisal.

The term citizen for purposes of this part includes both citizens of the United States and noncitizen nationals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Comparable replacement dwelling.

The term functionally equivalent means that it performs the same function, and provides the same utility. While a comparable replacement dwelling need not possess every feature of the displacement dwelling, the principal features must be present. Generally, functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range of purposes for which the various physical features of a dwelling may be used. However, in determining whether a replacement dwelling is functionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling, the Agency may consider reasonable trade-offs for specific features when the replacement unit is equal to or better than the displacement dwelling (See appendix A, Sec. 24.2(a)(6));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adequate in size to accommodate the occupants;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced person's dwelling with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities, and reasonably accessible to the person's place of employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> On a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements, including customary landscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, swimming pools, or greenhouses.

Such rental assistance must be paid under Sec. 24.404, Replacement housing of last resort.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> For a person receiving government housing assistance before displacement, a dwelling that may reflect similar government housing assistance. In such cases any requirements of the government housing assistance program relating to the size of the replacement dwelling shall apply. (See appendix A, Sec. 24.2(a)(6)(ix).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Contribute materially. The term contribute materially means that during the 2 taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Agency determines to be more equitable, a business or farm operation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contributed at least 33\1/3\ percent of the owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Agency may approve the use of other criteria as determined appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling. The term decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling means a dwelling which meets local housing and occupancy codes. However, any of the following standards which are not met by the local code shall apply unless waived for good cause by the Federal Agency funding the project. The dwelling shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be structurally sound, weather tight, and in good repair;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contain a heating system capable of sustaining a healthful temperature (of approximately 70 degrees) for a displaced person, except in those areas where local climatic conditions do not require such a system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space needed to accommodate the displaced person. The number of persons occupying each habitable room used for sleeping purposes shall not exceed that permitted by local housing codes or, in the absence of local codes, the policies of the displacing Agency. In addition, the displacing Agency shall follow the requirements for separate bedrooms for children of the opposite gender included in local housing codes or in the absence of local codes, the policies of such Agencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> There shall be a separate, well lighted and ventilated bathroom that provides privacy to the user and contains a sink, bathtub or shower stall, and a toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate sources of water and to a sewage drainage system. In the case of a housekeeping dwelling, there shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage drainage system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and refrigerator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Contains unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For a displaced person with a disability, be free of any barriers which would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such displaced person. (See appendix A, Sec. 24.2(a)(8)(vii).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Displaced person. (i) General. The term displaced person means, except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, any person who moves from the real property or moves his or her personal property from the real property. (This includes a person who occupies the real property prior to its acquisition, but who does not meet the length of occupancy requirements of the Uniform Act as described at Sec. 24.401(a) and Sec. 24.402(a)):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General.

However, eligibility for such person under this paragraph applies only for purposes of obtaining relocation assistance advisory services under Sec. 24.205(c), and moving expenses under Sec. 24.301, Sec. 24.302 or Sec. 24.303.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Persons not displaced. The following is a nonexclusive listing of persons who do not qualify as displaced persons under this part:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A person who moves before the initiation of negotiations (see Sec. 24.403(d)), unless the Agency determines that the person was displaced as a direct result of the program or project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A person who initially enters into occupancy of the property after the date of its acquisition for the project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A person who has occupied the property for the purpose of obtaining assistance under the Uniform Act;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A person who is not required to relocate permanently as a direct result of a project.
