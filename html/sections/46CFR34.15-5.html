(1) The amount of carbon dioxide required for each  space shall be as determined by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Total available supply. (1) A separate supply of carbon dioxide  need not be provided for each space protected. The total available  supply shall be at least sufficient for the space requiring the greatest  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Dry cargo spaces. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number of pounds of carbon dioxide  required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space  in cubic feet divided by 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Although separate piping shall be led to each cargo hold and  'tween deck, for the purpose of determining the amount of carbon dioxide  required, a cargo compartment will be considered as the space between  watertight or firescreen bulkheads and from the tank top or lowest deck  to the deck head of the uppermost space on which cargo may be carried.  If a trunk extends beyond such deck, the trunk volume shall be included.  Tonnage openings shall be considered as sealed for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Branch lines to the various cargo holds and 'tween decks shall  not be less than \3/4\-inch standard pipe size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em>. If fuel can drain from the compartment being  protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not  entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used  to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon  dioxide shall be arranged to discharge into both such compartments  simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0">Table 34.15-5(d)(1) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Gross volume of compartment, cubic feet -------------------------------------------------         Factor</p><p class="depth0">Over                   Not Over ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">500                      15</p><p class="depth0">500                    1,600                      16</p><p class="depth0">1,600                    4,500                      18</p><p class="depth0">4,000                   50,000                      20</p><p class="depth0">50,000        .......................                22 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of the above requirement of this paragraph, the  volume of a machinery space shall be taken as exclusive of the normal  machinery casing unless the boiler, internal combustion propelling  machinery, or fuel oil installations subject to the discharge pressure  of the fuel oil service pump extend into such space, in which case the  volume shall be taken to the top of the casing or the next material  reduction in casing area, whichever is lower.
