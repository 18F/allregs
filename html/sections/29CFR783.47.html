                            <p class="depth0">Off-duty periods include not only such periods as shore leave but  also generally those hours spent by a seaman on the vessel outside his  watch or normal or regular working hours and his standby periods during  which hours he is not required to perform and does not perform work of  any kind but is free to utilize his time for his own purpose. The fact  that during such off-duty periods the employee is subject to call in  case of emergency situations affecting the safety and welfare of the  vessel upon which he is employed, or of   its passengers, crew, or cargo or for participation in life boat or fire  drills will not render such off-duty periods, excluded by employment  agreement applicable to the employee, ``hours worked''. Responding to  such calls, however, as well as the performance of work in response  thereto constitute compensable work time. For further and more detailed  discussion on what generally are regarded as ``hours worked'' under the  Act, see part 785 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Application of the Exemptions</p>
