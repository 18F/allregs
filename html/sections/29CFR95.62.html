                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, DOL may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Sec. 95.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by DOL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withhold further awards for the project or program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Take other remedies that may be legally available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, DOL shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless DOL expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.'s 12549 and 12689 and DOL's implementing regulations. See Sec. 95.13 and 29 CFR part 98.</p>
