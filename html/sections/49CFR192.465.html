                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each pipeline that is under cathodic protection must be tested  at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15  months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the  requirements of Sec. 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are  impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or  transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately  protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling  basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed  over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a  different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire  system is tested in each 10-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current  power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with  intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, to insure that it is operating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference  bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be  electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar  year, but with intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months. Each other  interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but  with intervals not exceeding 15 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each operator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any  deficiencies indicated by the monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After the initial evaluation required by Secs. 192.455(b) and  (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less than every 3 years at  intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines  and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas  in which active corrosion is found. The operator must determine the  areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. However, on distribution  lines and where an electrical survey is impractical on transmission  lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined by other means that  include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records,  corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the  pipeline environment.
