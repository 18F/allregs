                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Place to make request. Any request by an individual to be advised whether any system of records maintained by the ASC and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her, or any request by an individual for access to a record pertaining to him or her that is contained in a system of records maintained by the ASC, shall be submitted in person at the ASC between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, which is located at 1401 H Street, NW., Suite 760,Washington, DC 20005, or by mail addressed to: Privacy Act Officer, ASC, 1401 H Street, NW., Suite 760,Washington, DC 20005. All requests will be required to be put in writing and signed by the individual making the request. In the case of requests for access that are made by mail, the envelope should be clearly marked ``Privacy Act Request.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information to be included in requests. Each request by an individual concerning whether the ASC maintains in a system of records a record that pertains to the individual, or for access to any record pertaining to the individual that is maintained by the ASC in a system of records, shall include such information as will assist the ASC in identifying those records as to which the individual is seeking information or access. Where practicable, the individual should identify the system of records that is the subject of his or her request by reference to the ASC's notices of systems of records, which are published in the Federal Register, as required by section (e)(4) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). Where a system of records is compiled on the basis of a specific identification scheme, the individual should include in his or her request the identification number or other identifier assigned to the individual. In the event the individual does not know that number or identifier, the individual shall provide other information, including his or her full name, address, date of birth and subject matter of the record, to aid in processing his or her request. If additional information is required before a request can be processed, the individual shall be so advised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verification of identity. When the fact of the existence of a record is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or when a record as to which access has been requested is not required to be disclosed under that Act, the individual seeking the information or requesting access to the record shall be required to verify his or her identity

before access will be granted or information given. For this purpose, individuals shall appear at the ASC located at 1401 H Street, NW., Suite 760,Washington, DC 20005, between 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. The ASC's Office is not open on Saturdays, Sundays or Federal holidays.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methods for verifying identity--appearance in person. For the purpose of verifying identity, an individual seeking information regarding pertinent records or access to those records shall furnish documentation that may reasonably be relied on to establish the individual's identity. Such documentation might include a valid birth certificate, driver's license, employee or military identification card, and medicare card.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method for verifying identity--by mail. Where an individual cannot appear at the ASC's Office for the purpose of verifying identity, the individual shall submit, along with the request for information or access, a signed and notarized statement attesting to his or her identity. Where access is being sought, the sworn statement shall include a representation that the records being sought pertain to the individual and a stipulation that the individual is aware that knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining records pertaining to an individual from the ASC under false pretenses is a criminal offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional procedures for verifying identity. When it appears appropriate to the Privacy Act Officer, other arrangements may be made for the verification of identity as are reasonable under the circumstances and appear to be effective to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, individual records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acknowledgement of requests for information pertaining to individual records in a record system or for access to individual records. (1) Except where an immediate acknowledgement is given for requests made in person, the receipt of a request for information pertaining to individual records in a record system will be acknowledged within 10 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays. Requests will be processed as promptly as possible and a response to such requests will be given within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) unless, within the 30 day period and for cause shown, the individual making the request is notified in writing that a longer period is necessary.
