                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The furnishing to tenants of services other than housing (whether or not the services are significant) does not prevent the units occupied by the tenants from qualifying as residential rental property eligible for

credit under section 42. However, any charges to low-income tenants for services that are not optional generally must be included in gross rent for purposes of section 42(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services that are optional--(1) General rule. A service is optional if payment for the service is not required as a condition of occupancy. For example, for a qualified low-income building with a common dining facility, the cost of meals is not included in gross rent for purposes of section 42(g)(2)(A) if payment for the meals in the facility is not required as a condition of occupancy and a practical alternative exists for tenants to obtain meals other than from the dining facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

For example, for a qualified low-income building with a common dining facility, the cost of meals is not included in gross rent for purposes of section 42(g)(2)(A) if payment for the meals in the facility is not required as a condition of occupancy and a practical alternative exists for tenants to obtain meals other than from the dining facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continual or frequent services. If continual or frequent nursing, medical, or psychiatric services are provided, it is presumed that the services are not optional and the building is ineligible for the credit, as is the case with a hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, lifecare facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally and physically handicapped. See also Sec.  1.42-9(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required services--(i) General rule. The cost of services that are required as a condition of occupancy must be included in gross rent even if federal or state law requires that the services be offered to tenants by building owners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The cost of services that are required as a condition of occupancy must be included in gross rent even if federal or state law requires that the services be offered to tenants by building owners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--(A) Supportive services. Section 42(g)(2)(B)(iii) provides an exception for certain fees paid for supportive services. For purposes of section 42(g)(2)(B)(iii), a supportive service is any service provided under a planned program of services designed to enable residents of a residential rental property to remain independent and avoid placement in a hospital, nursing home, or intermediate care facility for the mentally or physically handicapped. For a building described in section 42(i)(3)(B)(iii) (relating to transitional housing for the homeless) or section 42(i)(3)(B)(iv) (relating to single-room occupancy), a supportive service includes any service provided to assist tenants in locating and retaining permanent housing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Supportive services.

Gross rent does not include the cost of mandatory meals in any federally-assisted project for the elderly and handicapped (in existence on or before January 9, 1989) that is authorized by 24 CFR 278 to provide a mandatory meals program.
