In addition, the exporters or elevator operators shall notify the Service in writing of the intention to export grain under this waiver.

Official inspection and Class X weighing requirements apply only to exporters and individual elevator operators who (i) exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain during the preceding calendar year, or (ii) have exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain during the current calendar year.

Official inspection and Class X weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported for seeding purposes, provided that (i) the grain is (A) sold or consigned for sale and invoiced as seed; and (B) identified as seed for seeding purposes on the Shipper's Export Declaration; and (ii) records pertaining to these shipments are made available, upon request by the Service, for review or copying purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grain shipped in bond.

Official inspection requirements may be waived by the Service on a shipment-by-shipment basis for export grain not sold, offered for sale, or consigned for sale by official grade if (i) the contract and any amendments clearly show that the buyer and seller mutually agree to ship the grain without official inspection and (ii) a copy of the contract and any amendments is furnished in advance of loading, along with a completed application on a form prescribed by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Service not available. Upon request, any required official inspection or Class X weighing of grain may be waived on a shipment-by-shipment basis if (i) official personnel are not and will not be available within a 24-hour period to perform needed inspection or weighing services and (ii) both the buyer and seller of the grain are made aware that the grain has not been officially inspected or Class X weighed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Emergency waiver. Upon request, the requirements for official inspection or Class X weighing may be waived whenever the Service determines (i) that an emergency exists that precludes official inspection or Class X weighing and (ii) that granting an emergency waiver will not impair the objectives of the Act. To qualify for an emergency waiver, the exporter or elevator operator shall make timely application and comply with all conditions which may be required by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> High quality specialty grain shipped in containers.
