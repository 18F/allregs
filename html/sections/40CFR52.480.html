                            <p class="depth0">On January 14, 1994 the District of Columbia's Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs submitted a plan for the establishment and implementation of a Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, as required by section 182(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act. EPA approved the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program on September 11, 1995 and made it part of the District of Columbia SIP. As with all components of the SIP, the District of Columbia must implement the program as submitted and approved by EPA.
