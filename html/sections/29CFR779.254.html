                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The ordinary gasoline service establishment is a covered enterprise under the Act if it has an annual gross volume of sales made or business done of not less than $250,000 a year, exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated, and meets the other tests of section 3(s)(5) of the prior Act and section 3(s)(1) of the amended Act. Beginning February 1, 1969, enterprise coverage extends to any gasoline service establishment in an enterprise which has an annual gross volume in

such amount, even if the establishment's annual gross volume is less. However, a gasoline service establishment with gross sales of less than $250,000, exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated, may qualify for the minimum wage and overtime pay exemption provided in section 13(a)(2) of the Act if it meets the requirements of that section. Section 779.313 summarizes the requirements. An overtime pay exemption, which was repealed by the 1966 amendments, existed until February 1, 1967, for employees of ordinary gasoline service establishments under the prior Act. Thus, nonexempt employees of a covered gasoline service establishment enterprise are subject to the minimum wage standards for previously covered employment and the overtime pay requirements for newly covered employment as listed below:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum wage:                          Beginning------------------------------------------------------------------------$1.40 an hour.............................  February 1, 1967.$1.60 an hour.............................  February 1, 1968 and</p><p class="depth0">thereafter.</p><p class="depth0">Overtime pay after:</p><p class="depth0">44 hours in a workweek....................  February 1, 1967.42 hours in a workweek....................  February 1, 1968.40 hours in a workweek....................  February 1, 1969 and</p><p class="depth0">thereafter.------------------------------------------------------------------------

The particular considerations affecting coverage and exemptions are discussed in subsequent sections. The statutory language contained in section 3(s)(5) of the prior Act and 3(s)(1) of the amended Act may be found in Sec. 779.22.</p>
