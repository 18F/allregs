                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to, or upon, arrival of a foreign-produced peanut lot at a port-of-entry, the importer, or customs broker acting on behalf of the importer, shall mail or send by facsimile transmission (fax) a copy of the Customs Service entry documentation for the peanut lot or lots to the Inspection Service office that will perform sampling of the peanut shipment. More than one lot may be entered on one entry document. The documentation shall include: the Customs Service entry number; the container number(s) or other identification of the lot(s); the volume of the peanuts in each lot being entered, the inland shipment destination where the lot will be made available for inspection; and a contact name or telephone number at the destination. The inspection office shall sign, stamp, and return the entry document to the importer. The importer shall cause a copy of the relevant entry documentation to accompany each peanut lot and be presented to the Inspection Service at the time of inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Importers shall report to AMS the entry number, container number, and inspection certificate of those peanuts which are sampled and inspected but which are subsequently exported as excess of the peanut import quota. Peanuts for which an import application is filed with the Customs Service, and which are not sampled and inspected, but which are subsequently exported as excess of quota, shall not be reported to USDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Early arrival and storage. Peanut lots sampled and inspected upon arrival in the United States, but placed in storage for more than one month prior to beginning of the quota year for which the peanuts will be entered, must be reported to USDA at the time of inspection. The importer shall file copies of the Customs Service documentation showing the volume of peanuts placed in storage and location, including any identifying number of the storage warehouse. Such peanuts should be stored in clean, dry warehouses and under cold storage conditions consistent with industry standards. USDA may require re-inspection of the lot at the time the lot is declared for entry with the Customs Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional standards. (1) Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any importer from milling or reconditioning, prior to importation, any shipment of peanuts for the purpose of making such lot eligible for importation into the United States. However, all peanuts entered for human consumption use must be certified as meeting the quality standards specified in Sec. 996.31(a) prior to such disposition. Failure to fully comply with quality and handling standards as required under this section, will result enforcement action by USDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any importer from milling or reconditioning, prior to importation, any shipment of peanuts for the purpose of making such lot eligible for importation into the United States.

other applicable laws, or regulations of other Federal agencies, including import regulations and procedures of the Customs Service.
