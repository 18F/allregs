                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply in this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Afterburning. The combustion of any flammable mixture that is drawn  into an enclosure after an internal explosion in the enclosure. This  condition is determined through detection of secondary pressure peaks  occurring subsequent to the initial explosion.</p><p class="depth0">Cylindrical joint. A joint comprised of two contiguous, concentric,  cylindrical surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">Explosion-proof enclosure. A metallic enclosure used as a winding  compartment, conduit box, or a combination of both that complies with  the applicable requirements of Sec. 7.304 of this part and is  constructed so that it will withstand the explosion tests of Sec. 7.306  of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Fastening. A bolt, screw, or stud used to secure adjoining parts to  prevent the escape of flame from an explosion-proof enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Flame-arresting path. Two or more adjoining or adjacent surfaces  between which the escape of flame is prevented.</p><p class="depth0">Internal free volume (of an empty enclosure). The volume remaining  after deducting the volume of any part that is essential in maintaining  the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure or necessary for  operation of the motor. Essential parts include the parts that  constitute the flame-arresting path and those necessary to secure parts  that constitute a flame-arresting path.</p><p class="depth0">Motor assembly. The winding compartment including a conduit box when  specified. A motor assembly is comprised of one or more explosion-proof  enclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Plane joint. A joint comprised of two adjoining surfaces in parallel  planes.</p><p class="depth0">Step (rabbet) joint. A joint comprised of two adjoining surfaces  with a change or changes in direction between its inner and outer edges.  A step joint may be composed of a cylindrical portion and a plane  portion or of two or more plane portions.</p><p class="depth0">Stuffing box. An entrance with a recess filled with packing material  for cables extending through a wall of an explosion-proof enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Threaded joint. A joint consisting of a male- and a female-threaded  member, both of which are the same type and gauge.</p>
