It typically consists  of cutting the rail and removing rail anchoring devices, which provides  for the necessary expansion and contraction, and then re-assembling the  track.</p><p class="depth2">Annual re-training means training every calendar year.</p><p class="depth2">Buckling incident means the formation of a lateral misalignment  sufficient in magnitude to constitute a deviation from the Class 1  requirements specified in Sec. 213.55. These normally occur when rail  temperatures are relatively high and are caused by high longitudinal  compressive forces.</p><p class="depth2">Buckling-prone condition means a track condition that can result in  the track being laterally displaced due to high compression forces  caused by critical rail temperature combined with insufficient track  strength and/or train dynamics.</p><p class="depth2">Continuous welded rail (CWR) means rail that has been welded  together into lengths exceeding 400 feet. Rail installed as CWR remains  CWR, regardless of whether a joint or plug is installed into the rail at  a later time.</p><p class="depth2">Corrective actions mean those actions which track owners specify in  their CWR plans to address conditions of actual or potential joint  failure, including, as applicable, repair, restrictions on operations,  and additional on-foot inspections.</p><p class="depth2">CWR joint means any joint directly connected to CWR.</p><p class="depth2">Desired rail installation temperature range means the rail  temperature range, within a specific geographical area, at which forces  in CWR should not cause a buckling incident in extreme heat, or a pull  apart during extreme cold weather.</p><p class="depth2">Disturbed track means the disturbance of the roadbed or ballast  section, as a result of track maintenance or any other event, which  reduces the lateral or longitudinal resistance of the track, or both.</p><p class="depth2">Mechanical stabilization means a type of procedure used to restore  track resistance to disturbed track following certain maintenance  operations. This procedure may incorporate dynamic track stabilizers or  ballast consolidators, which are units of work equipment that are used  as a substitute for the stabilization action provided by the passage of  tonnage trains.</p><p class="depth2">Pull apart or stripped joint means a condition when no bolts are  mounted through a joint on the rail end, rending the joint bar  ineffective due to excessive expansive or contractive forces.</p><p class="depth2">Pull-apart prone condition means a condition when the actual rail  temperature is below the rail neutral temperature at or near a joint  where longitudinal tensile forces may affect the fastenings at the  joint.</p><p class="depth2">Rail anchors mean those devices which are attached to the rail and  bear against the side of the crosstie to control longitudinal rail  movement. Certain types of rail fasteners also act as rail anchors and  control longitudinal rail movement by exerting a downward clamping force  on the upper surface of the rail base.</p><p class="depth2">Rail neutral temperature is the temperature at which the rail is  neither in compression nor tension.</p><p class="depth2">Rail temperature means the temperature of the rail, measured with a  rail thermometer.</p><p class="depth2">Remedial actions mean those actions which track owners are required  to take as a result of requirements of this part to address a non- compliant condition.</p><p class="depth2">Tight/kinky rail means CWR which exhibits minute alinement  irregularities which indicate that the rail is in a considerable amount  of compression.</p><p class="depth2">Tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations mean railroad  operations that carry passengers with the conveyance of the passengers  to a particular destination not being the principal purpose.</p><p class="depth2">Track lateral resistance means the resistance provided by the rail/ crosstie structure against lateral displacement.</p><p class="depth2">Track longitudinal resistance means the resistance provided by the  rail anchors/rail fasteners and the ballast section to the rail/crosstie  structure against longitudinal displacement.</p><p class="depth2">Train-induced forces means the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral  dynamic forces which are generated during train movement and which can  contribute to the buckling potential of the rail.</p><p class="depth2">Unscheduled detour operation means a short-term, unscheduled  operation where a track owner has no more than 14 calendar days' notice  that the operation is going to occur.
