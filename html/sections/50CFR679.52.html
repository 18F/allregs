For an observer provider with ownership based  outside the United States, identify an authorized agent and provide  contact information for that agent including mailing address and phone  and fax numbers where the agent can be contacted for official  correspondence. An authorized agent means a person appointed and  maintained within the United States who is authorized to receive and  respond to any legal process issued in the United States to an owner or  employee of an observer provider. Any diplomatic official accepting such  an appointment as designated agent waives diplomatic or other immunity  in connection with the process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement signed under penalty of perjury from each owner,  or owners, board members, and officers if a corporation, that they have  no conflict of interest as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement signed under penalty of perjury from each owner, or  owners, board members, and officers if a corporation, describing any  criminal convictions, Federal contracts they have had and the  performance rating they received on the contract, and previous  decertification action while working as an observer or observer  provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A description of any prior experience the applicant may have in  placing individuals in remote field and/or marine work environments.

An  observer provider who receives an IAD of permit expiration may appeal  under Sec. 679.43. An observer provider that appeals an IAD will be  issued an extension of the expiration date of the permit until after the  final resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Sanctions.
