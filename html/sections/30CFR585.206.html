                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BOEM will determine the size for each lease based on the area required to accommodate the anticipated activities. The processes leading to both competitive and noncompetitive issuance of leases will provide public notice of the lease size adopted. We will delineate leases by using mapped OCS blocks or portions, or aggregations of blocks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The lease size includes the minimum area that will allow the lessee sufficient space to develop the project and manage activities in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this part. The lease may include whole lease blocks or portions of a lease block.
