                            <p class="depth0">Protective advances are advances made by the lender for the purpose of preserving and protecting the collateral where the debtor has failed to, will not, or cannot meet its obligations. Sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the protective advance preserves collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance. Protective advances will not be made in lieu of additional loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The maximum loss to be paid by the Agency will never exceed the original principal plus accrued interest regardless of any protective advances made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protective advances and interest thereon at the note rate will be guaranteed at the same percentage of loss as provided in the Loan Note Guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protective advances must constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instruments. Agency written authorization is required when cumulative protective advances exceed $5,000.</p>
