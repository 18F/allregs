The date of filing will be the date 60 days after the date FDA received the application. The date of filing begins the 180-day period described in section 505(c) of the act. This 180-day period is called the ``filing clock.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If FDA refuses to file the application, the agency will notify the applicant in writing and state the reason under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section for the refusal. If FDA refuses to file the application under paragraph (d) of this section, the applicant may request in writing within 30 days of the date of the agency's notification an informal conference with the agency about whether the agency should file the application. If, following the informal conference, the applicant requests that FDA file the application (with or without amendments to correct the deficiencies), the agency will file the application over protest under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, notify the applicant in writing, and review it as filed. If the application is filed over protest, the date of filing will be the date 60 days after the date the applicant requested the informal conference. The applicant need not resubmit a copy of an application that is filed over protest. If FDA refuses to file the application under paragraph (e) of this section, the applicant may amend the application and resubmit it, and the agency will make a determination under this section whether it may be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> An abbreviated new drug application will be reviewed after it is submitted to determine whether the abbreviated application may be received.
