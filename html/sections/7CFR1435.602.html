(The definition for ``marketing'' in Sec. 1435.2 applies to this subpart.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CCC will only purchase sugar located in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CCC will evaluate an offer to sell sugar to CCC based upon CCC's estimate of the reduction in refined sugar supply available for human consumption due to the purchase. For example, if processing thick juice (an in-process sugar) would yield 70 percent sugar for human consumption, then CCC will only consider 70 percent of the volume of the thick juice in evaluating the per unit sales price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CCC will only purchase the sugar if such purchase would reduce the likelihood of forfeitures of CCC sugar loans, as determined by CCC.</p>
