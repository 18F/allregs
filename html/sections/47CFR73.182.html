                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 73.21 to 73.37, inclusive, govern allocation of  facilities in the AM broadcast band 535-1705 kHz. Sec.  73.21  establishes three classes of channels in this band, namely, clear,  regional and local. The classes and power of AM broadcast stations which  will be assigned to the various channels are set forth in Sec.  73.21.  The classifications of the AM broadcast stations are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class A stations operate on clear channels with powers no less  than 10kW nor greater than 50 kW. These stations are designed to render  primary and secondary service over an extended area, with their primary  services areas protected from objectionable interference from other  stations on the same and adjacent channels. Their secondary service  areas are protected from objectionable interference from co-channel  stations. For purposes of protection, Class A stations may be divided  into two groups, those located in any of the contiguous 48 States and  those located in Alaska in accordance with Sec.  73.25.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The mainland U.S. Class A stations are those assigned to the  channels allocated by Sec.  73.25. The power of these stations shall be  50 kW. The Class A stations in this group are afforded protection as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Daytime. To the 0.1 mV/m groundwave contour from stations on the  same channel, and to the 0.5 mV/m groundwave contour from stations on  adjacent channels.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Nighttime. To the 0.5 mV/m-50% skywave contour from stations on  the same channels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Class A stations in Alaska operate on the channels allocated by  Sec.  73.25 with a minimum power of 10 kW, a maximum power of 50 kW, and  an antenna efficiency of 282 mV/m/kW at 1 kilometer. Stations operating  on these channels in Alaska which have not been designated as Class A  stations in response to licensee request will continue to be considered  as Class B stations. During daytime hours a Class A station in Alaska is  protected to the 100 [micro]V/m groundwave contour from co-channel  stations. During nighttime hours, a Class A station in Alaska is  protected to the 100 [micro]V/m-50 percent skywave contour from co- channel stations. The 0.5 mV/m groundwave contour is protected both  daytime and nighttime from stations on adjacent channels.</p><p class="depth4">Note: In the Report and Order in MM Docket No. 83-807, the  Commission designated 15 stations operating on U.S. clear channels as  Alaskan Class A stations. Eleven of these stations already have Alaskan  Class A facilities and are to be protected accordingly. Permanent  designation of the other   four stations as Alaskan Class A is conditioned on their constructing  minimum Alaskan Class A facilities no later than December 31, 1989.  Until that date or until such facilities are obtained, these four  stations shall be temporarily designated as Alaskan Class A stations,  and calculations involving these stations should be based on existing  facilities but with an assumed power of 10 kW. Thereafter, these  stations are to be protected based on their actual Alaskan Class A  facilities. If any of these stations does not obtain Alaskan Class A  facilities in the period specified, it is to be protected as a Class B  station based on its actual facilities. These four stations may increase  power to 10 kW without regard to the impact on co-channel Class B  stations. However, power increases by these stations above 10 kW (or by  existing Alaskan Class A stations beyond their current power level) are  subject to applicable protection requirements for co-channel Class B  stations. Other stations not on the original list but which meet  applicable requirements may obtain Alaskan Class A status by seeking  such designation from the Commission. If a power increase or other  change in facilities by a station not on the original list is required  to obtain minimum Alaskan Class A facilities, any such application shall  meet the interference protection requirements applicable to an Alaskan  Class A proposal on the channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class B stations are stations which operate on clear and  regional channels with powers not less than 0.25 kW nor more than 50 kW.  These stations render primary service only, the area of which depends on  their geographical location, power, and frequency. It is recommended  that Class B stations be located so that the interference received from  other stations will not limit the service area to a groundwave contour  value greater than 2.0 mV/m nighttime and to the 0.5 mV/m groundwave  contour daytime, which are the values for the mutual protection between  this class of stations and other stations of the same class.</p><p class="depth3">Note: See Sec. Sec.  73.21(b)(1) and 73.26(b) concerning power  restrictions and classifications relative to Class B, Class C, and Class  D stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Stations in the above-named places that are reclassified from Class C to  Class B stations under Sec.  73.26(b) shall not be authorized to  increase power to levels that would increase the nighttime interference- free limit of co-channel Class C stations in the conterminous United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Class C stations operate on local channels, normally rendering  primary service to a community and the suburban or rural areas  immediately contiguous thereto, with powers not less than 0.25 kW, nor  more than 1 kW, except as provided in Sec.  73.21(c)(1). Such stations  are normally protected to the daytime 0.5 mV/m contour. On local  channels the separation required for the daytime protection shall also  determine the nighttime separation. Where directional antennas are  employed daytime by Class C stations operating with more than 0.25 kW  power, the separations required shall in no case be less than those  necessary to afford protection, assuming nondirectional operation with  0.25 kW. In no case will 0.25 kW or greater nighttime power be  authorized to a station unable to operate nondirectionally with a power  of 0.25 kW during daytime hours. The actual nighttime limitation will be  calculated. For nighttime protection purposes, Class C stations in the  48 contiguous United States may assume that stations in Alaska, Hawaii,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands operating on 1230, 1240, 1340,  1400, 1450, and 1490 kHz are Class C stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Class D stations operate on clear and regional channels with  daytime powers of not less than 0.25 kW (or equivalent RMS field of 141  mV/m at one kilometer if less than 0.25 kW) and not more than 50 kW.  Class D stations that have previously received nighttime authority  operate with powers of less than 0.25 kW (or equivalent RMS fields of  less than 141 mV/m at one kilometer) are not required to provide  nighttime coverage in accordance with Sec.  73.24(j) and are not  protected from interference during nighttime hours. Such nighttime  authority is permitted on the basis of full nighttime protection being  afforded to all Class A and Class B stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a station is already limited by interference from other  stations to a contour value greater than that normally protected for its  class, the individual received limits shall be the established standard  for such station with respect to interference from each other station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The four classes of AM broadcast stations have in general three  types of   service areas, i.e., primary, secondary and intermittent. (See Sec.   73.14 for the definitions of primary, secondary, and intermittent  service areas.) Class A stations render service to all three areas.  Class B stations render service to a primary area but the secondary and  intermittent service areas may be materially limited or destroyed due to  interference from other stations, depending on the station assignments  involved. Class C and Class D stations usually have only primary service  areas. Interference from other stations may limit intermittent service  areas and generally prevents any secondary service to those stations  which operate at night. Complete intermittent service may still be  obtained in many cases depending on the station assignments involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The groundwave signal strength required to render primary  service is 2 mV/m for communities with populations of 2,500 or more and  0.5 mV/m for communities with populations of less than 2,500. See Sec.   73.184 for curves showing distance to various groundwave field strength  contours for different frequencies and ground conductivities, and also  see Sec.  73.183, ``Groundwave signals.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Class C station may be authorized to operate with a  directional antenna during daytime hours providing the power is at least  0.25 kW. In computing the degrees of protection which such antenna will  afford, the radiation produced by the directional antenna system will be  assumed to be no less, in any direction, than that which would result  from non-directional operation using a single element of the directional  array, with 0.25 kW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All classes of broadcast stations have primary service areas  subject to limitation by fading and noise, and interference from other  stations to the contours set out for each class of station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Secondary service is provided during nighttime hours in areas  where the skywave field strength, 50% or more of the time, is 0.5 mV/m  or greater (0.1 mV/m in Alaska). Satisfactory secondary service to  cities is not considered possible unless the field strength of the  skywave signal approaches or exceeds the value of the groundwave field  strength that is required for primary service. Secondary service is  subject to some interference and extensive fading whereas the primary  service area of a station is subject to no objectionable interference or  fading. Only Class A stations are assigned on the basis of rendering  secondary service.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Standards have not been established for objectionable fading  because of the relationship to receiver characteristics. Selective  fading causes audio distortion and signal strength reduction below the  noise level, objectionable characteristics inherent in many modern  receivers. The AVC circuits in the better designed receivers generally  maintain the audio output at a sufficiently constant level to permit  satisfactory reception during most fading conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Intermittent service is rendered by the groundwave and begins at  the outer boundary of the primary service area and extends to a distance  where the signal strength decreases to a value that is too low to  provide any service. This may be as low as a few [micro]V/m in certain  areas and as high as several millivolts per meter in other areas of high  noise level, interference from other stations, or objectionable fading  at night. The intermittent service area may vary widely from day to  night and generally varies over shorter intervals of time. Only Class A  stations are protected from interference from other stations to the  intermittent service area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Broadcast stations are licensed to operate unlimited time,  limited time, daytime, share time, and specified hours. (See Sec. Sec.   73.1710, 73.1725, 73.1720, 73.1715, and 73.1730.) Applications for new  stations shall specify unlimited time operation only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Section 73.24 sets out the general requirements for modifying  the facilities of a licensed station and for establishing a new station.  Sections 73.24(b) and 73.37 include interference related provisions that  be considered in connection with an application to modify the facilities  of an existing station or to establish a new station. Section 73.30  describes the procedural steps required to receive an authorization to  operate in the 1605-1705 kHz band.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Objectionable nighttime interference from a broadcast station  occurs   when, at a specified field strength contour with respect to the desired  station, the field strength of an undesired station (co-channel or first  adjacent channel, after application of proper protection ratio) exceeds  for 10% or more of the time the values set forth in these standards. The  value derived from the root-sum-square of all interference contributions  represents the extent of a station's interference-free coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to the root-sum-square (RSS) values of interfering  field strengths referred to in this section, calculation of nighttime  interference-free service is accomplished by considering the signals on  the three channels of concern (co- and first adjacencies) in order of  decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the values and extracting  the square root of the sum, excluding those signals which are less than  50% of the RSS values of the higher signals already included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to the root-sum-square values of interfering field  strengths referred to in this section, calculation of nighttime  interference for non-coverage purposes is accomplished by considering  the signals on the three channels of concern (co- and first adjacencies)  in order of decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the values and  extracting the square root of the sum, excluding those signals which are  less than 25% of the RSS values of the higher signals already included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to the root-sum-square values of interfering field  strengths referred to in this section, calculation is accomplished by  considering the signals on the three channels of concern (co- and first  adjacencies) in order of decreasing magnitude, adding the squares of the  values and extracting the square root of the sum. The 0% exclusion  method applies only to the determination of an improvement factor value  for evaluating a station's eligibility for migration to the band 1605- 1705 kHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The RSS value will not be considered to be increased when a new  interfering signal is added which is less than the appropriate exclusion  percentage as applied to the RSS value of the interference from existing  stations, and which at the same time is not greater than the smallest  signal included in the RSS value of interference from existing stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is recognized that application of the above ``50% exclusion''  method (or any exclusion method using a per cent value greater than  zero) of calculating the RSS interference may result in some cases in  anomalies wherein the addition of a new interfering signal or the  increase in value of an existing interfering signal will cause the  exclusion of a previously included signal and may cause a decrease in  the calculated RSS value of interference. In order to provide the  Commission with more realistic information regarding gains and losses in  service (as a basis for determination of the relative merits of a  proposed operation) the following alternate method for calculating the  proposed RSS values of interference will be employed wherever  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the cases where it is proposed to add a new interfering  signal which is not less than 50% (or 25%, depending on which study is  being performed) of the RSS value of interference from existing stations  or which is greater that the smallest signal already included to obtain  this RSS value, the RSS limitation after addition of the new signal  shall be calculated without excluding any signal previously included.  Similarly, in cases where it is proposed to increase the value of one of  the existing interfering signals which has been included in the RSS  value, the RSS limitation after the increase shall be calculated without  excluding the interference from any source previously included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the new or increased signal proposed in such cases is  ultimately authorized, the RSS values of interference to other stations  affected will thereafter be calculated by the ``50% exclusion'' (or 25%  exclusion, depending on which study is being performed) method without  regard to this alternate method of calculation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Examples of RSS interference calculations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Existing interferences:  Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m. Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m. Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m. Station No. 4--0.58 mV/m.     The RSS value from Nos. 1, 2 and 3 is 1.31 mV/m; therefore interference  from No. 4 is excluded for it is less than 50% of 1.31 mV/m.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Station A receives interferences from:  Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m. Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m. Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m.  It is proposed to add a new limitation, 0.68 mV/m. This is more than 50%  of 1.31 mV/m, the RSS value from Nos. 1, 2 and 3. The RSS value of  Station No. 1 and of the proposed station would be 1.21 m/Vm which is  more than twice as large as the limitation from Station No. 2 or No. 3.  However, under the above provision the new signal and the three existing  interferences are nevertheless calculated for purposes of comparative  studies, resulting in an RSS value of 1.47 mV/m. However, if the  proposed station is ultimately authorized, only No. 1 and the new signal  are included in all subsequent calculations for the reason that Nos. 2  and 3 are less than 50% of 1.21 mV/m, the RSS value of the new signal  and No. 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Station A receives interferences from:  Station No. 1--1.00 mV/m. Station No. 2--0.60 mV/m. Station No. 3--0.59 mV/m.  No. 1 proposes to increase the limitation it imposes on Station A to  1.21 mV/m. Although the limitations from stations Nos. 2 and 3 are less  than 50% of the 1.21 mV/m limitation, under the above provision they are  nevertheless included for comparative studies, and the RSS limitation is  calculated to be 1.47 mV/m. However, if the increase proposed by Station  No. 1 is authorized, the RSS value then calculated is 1.21 mV/m because  Stations Nos. 2 and 3 are excluded in view of the fact that the  limitations they impose are less than 50% of 1.21 mV/m.</p><p class="depth4">Note: The principles demonstrated in the previous examples for the  calculation of the 50% exclusion method also apply to calculations using  the 25% exclusion method after appropriate adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Objectionable nighttime interference from a station shall be  considered to exist to a station when, at the field strength contour  specified in paragraph (q) of this section with respect to the class to  which the station belongs, the field strength of an interfering station  operating on the same channel or on a first adjacent channel after  signal adjustment using the proper protection ratio, exceeds for 10% or  more of the time the value of the permissible interfering signal set  forth opposite such class in paragraph (q) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> For the purpose of estimating the coverage and the interfering  effects of stations in the absence of field strength measurements, use  shall be made of Figure 8 of Sec.  73.190, which describes the estimated  effective field (for 1 kW power input) of simple vertical  omnidirectional antennas of various heights with ground systems having  at least 120 quarter-wavelength radials. Certain approximations, based  on the curve or other appropriate theory, may be made when other than  such antennas and ground systems are employed, but in any event the  effective field to be employed shall not be less than the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Class of station                Effective field (at 1 km) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ All Class A (except Alaskan)...............  362 mV/m.

To determine the interference in any</p><p class="depth2">direction, the measured or calculated radiated field (unattenuated</p><p class="depth2">field strength at 1 kilometer from the array) must be used in</p><p class="depth2">conjunction with the appropriate propagation curves. (See Sec.</p><p class="depth2">73.185 for further discussion and solution of a typical directional</p><p class="depth2">antenna case.) Note (2): For Class B stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the</p><p class="depth2">U.S. Virgin Islands, 241 mV/m shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The existence or absence of objectionable groundwave  interference from stations on the same or adjacent channels shall be  determined by actual measurements made in accordance with the method  described in Sec.  73.186, or in the absence of such measurements, by  reference to the propagation curves of Sec.  73.184. The existence or  absence of objectionable interference due to skywave propagation shall  be determined by reference to Formula 2 in Sec.  73.190.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Computation of skywave field strength values:--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fifty percent  skywave field strength values (clear channel).

For the purpose of estimating coverage of such  stations, areas in which the signal ratio is between 1:2 and 2:1 will  not be considered as receiving satisfactory service.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Two stations are considered to be operated synchronously when  the carriers are maintained within 0.2 Hz of each other and they  transmit identical program s.
