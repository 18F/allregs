                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Intermediaries' contact. Intermediaries desiring assistance under this subpart may file applications with the state office for the state in which

the intermediary's headquarters is located. Intermediaries headquartered in the District of Columbia may file the application with the National Office, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, USDA, Specialty Lenders Division, STOP 1521, 1400 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20250-1521.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing applications. Intermediaries must file the complete application, in one package. Applications received by the Agency will be reviewed and ranked quarterly and funded in the order of priority ranking. The Agency will retain unsuccessful applications for consideration in subsequent reviews, through a total of four quarterly reviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan priorities. A point system will be used to determine an eligible applicant's priority for available loan funds. Points will be allowed only for factors indicated by well documented, reasonable plans which, in the opinion of the Agency, provide assurance that the items have a high probability of being accomplished. The points awarded will be as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section. If an application does not fit one of the categories listed, it receives no points for that paragraph or subparagraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Other funds. Points allowed under this paragraph are to be based on documented successful history or written evidence that the funds are available.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The intermediary will obtain non-Federal loan or grant funds to pay part of the cost of the ultimate recipients' projects. The amount of funds from other sources will average:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 10% but less than 25% of the total project cost--5 points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 25% but less than 50% of the total project cost--10 points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 50% or more of the total project cost--15 points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The intermediary will provide loans to ultimate recipients from its project contribution funds to pay part of the costs of ultimate recipient projects. Project contribution funds must be separate and distinct from any loan or grant dollars provided to the intermediary under the IRP, as well as the intermediary's equity contribution. When evaluating an application for initial or supplemental funding, the Agency will consider the level of the applicant's project contribution and award points as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 10% but less than 25% of the total project costs--5 points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 25% but less than 50% of total project costs--10 points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 50% or more of total project costs--15 points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employment. For computations under this paragraph, income data should be from the latest decennial census of the United States, updated according to changes in the consumer price index. The poverty line used will be as defined in section 673 (2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)). Unemployment data used will be that published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The median household income in the service area of the proposed intermediary equals the following percentage of the poverty line for a family of four:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 150% but not more than 175%--5 points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 125% but less than 150%--10 points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Below 125%--15 points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following percentage of the loans the intermediary makes from Agency IRP loan funds will be in counties with median household income below 80 percent of the statewide non-metropolitan median household income. (To receive priority points under this category, the intermediary must provide a list of counties in the service area that have qualifying income):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 50% but less than 75%--5 points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 75% but less than 100%--10 points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 100%--15 points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The unemployment rate in the intermediary's service area equals the following percentage of the national unemployment rate:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 100% but less than 125%--5 points;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 125% but less 150%--10 points; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 150% or more--15 points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The intermediary will require, as a condition of eligibility for a loan to an ultimate recipient from Agency IRP loan funds, that the ultimate recipient certify in writing that it will employ

All assets of the IRP revolving fund will serve as security for the IRP loan, and the intermediary will contribute funds not derived from the Agency into the IRP revolving fund along with the proceeds of the IRP loan. The amount of non-Agency derived funds contributed to the IRP revolving fund will equal the following percentage of the Agency IRP loan:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 5% but less than 15%--15 points;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 15% but less than 25%--30 points; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 25% or more--50 points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Experience. The intermediary has actual experience in making and servicing commercial loans, with a successful record, for the following number of full years:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 1 but less than 3 years--5 points;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 3 but less than 5 years--10 points;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 5 but less than 10 years--20 points; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 10 or more years--30 points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Community representation. The service area is not more than 14 counties and the intermediary utilizes local opinions and experience by including community representatives on its board of directors or equivalent oversight board. For purposes of this section, community representatives are people, such as civic leaders, business representatives, or bankers, who reside in the service area and are not employees of the intermediary. Points will be assigned as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 10% but less than 40% of the board members are community representatives--5 points;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 40% but less than 75% of the board members are community representatives--10 points; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 75% of the board members are community representatives--15 points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Administrative. The Administrator may assign up to 35 additional points to an application to account for the following items not adequately covered by the other priority criteria set out in this section. The items that may be considered are the amount of funds requested in relation to the amount of need; a particularly successful business development record; a service area with no other IRP coverage; a service area with severe economic problems, such as communities that have remained persistently poor over the last 60 years or have experienced long-term population decline or job deterioration; a service area with emergency conditions caused by a natural disaster or loss of a major industry; a work plan that is in accord with a strategic plan, particularly a plan prepared as part of a request for an Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community designation; or excellent utilization of a previous IRP loan.
