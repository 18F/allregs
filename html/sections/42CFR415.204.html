Payment to a participating skilled nursing facility may include the cost of services of an intern or resident who is in an approved GME program in a hospital with which the skilled nursing facility has a transfer agreement that provides, in part, for the transfer of patients and the interchange of medical records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Home health agency. A participating home health agency may receive payment for the cost of the services of an intern or resident who is under an approved GME program of a hospital with which the home health agency is affiliated or under common control if these services are furnished as part of the home health visits for a Medicare beneficiary. (Nevertheless, see Secs. 413.75 through 413.83 of this chapter for the costs of approved GME programs in hospital-based providers.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medicare Part B payment. Medical services of a resident of a hospital that are furnished by a skilled nursing facility or home health agency are paid under Medicare Part B if payment is not provided under Medicare Part A. Payment is made under Part B for a resident's services by reducing the reasonable costs of furnishing the services by the beneficiary deductible and paying 80 percent of the remaining amount.
