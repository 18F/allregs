                                Sec.  63.1270  Applicability and designation of affected source.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> and (4) of  this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas  throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use  the facility design maximum natural gas throughput to estimate the  maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's  major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented  and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with  Sec.  63.10(b)(3). A compressor station that transports natural gas  prior to the point of custody transfer or to a natural gas processing  plant (if present) is not considered a part of the natural gas  transmission and storage source category. A facility that is determined  to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its  potential to emit above the major source levels (without obtaining and  complying with other limitations that keep its potential to emit HAP  below major source levels), and becomes a major source, must comply  thereafter with all applicable provisions of this subpart starting on  the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this  section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from  limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that  may be available through the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities that store natural gas or facilities that transport  and store natural gas shall calculate maximum annual facility natural  gas throughput using the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.026  Where:  Throughput = Maximum annual facilitywide natural gas throughput in cubic</p><p class="depth3">meters per year. IR max = Maximum facility injection rate in cubic meters per</p><p class="depth3">hour. WR max = Maximum facility withdrawal rate in cubic meters per</p><p class="depth3">hour. 8,760 = Maximum hours of operation per year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)-(iii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facilities that only transport natural gas shall calculate the  maximum natural gas throughput as the highest annual natural gas  throughput over the 5 years prior to June 17, 1999, multiplied by a  factor of 1.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual  facility natural gas throughput each year and upon request, submit such  records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas  throughput increases above the maximum natural gas throughput calculated  in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the maximum natural gas  throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied  by a factor of 1.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for  other parameters used to calculate potential emissions as the maximum  over the same period for which maximum throughput is determined as  specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. These  parameters shall be based on an annual average or the highest single  measured value. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol  dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation  shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational  design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in Sec.   63.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each large glycol dehydration unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction  commenced on or before August 23, 2011, is an existing small glycol  dehydration unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction  commenced after August 23, 2011, is a new small glycol dehydration unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator of a facility that does not contain an  affected source, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, is not  subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of each affected source shall achieve  compliance with the provisions of this subpart by the following dates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) through (4) of this  section, the owner or operator of an affected source, the construction  or reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, shall  achieve compliance with this provisions of the subpart no later than  June 17, 2002 except as provided for in Sec.  63.6(i). The owner or  operator of an area source, the construction or reconstruction of which  commenced before February 6, 1998, that increases its emissions of (or  its potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source  that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 3 years  after becoming a major source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) through (4) of this  section, the owner or operator of an affected source, the construction  or reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, shall  achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart immediately upon  initial startup or June 17, 1999, whichever date is later. Area sources,  the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after  February 6, 1998, that become major sources shall comply with the  provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each affected small glycol dehydration unit, as defined in Sec.   63.1271, located at a major source, that commenced construction before  August 23, 2011, must achieve compliance no later than October 15, 2015,  except as provided in Sec.  63.6(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each affected small glycol dehydration unit, as defined in Sec.   63.1271, located at a major source, that commenced construction on or  after August 23, 2011, must achieve compliance immediately upon initial  startup or October 15, 2012, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An owner or operator of an affected source that is a major  source or is located at a major source and is subject to the provisions  of this subpart is also subject to 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permitting  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exemptions. A facility with a facilitywide actual annual average  natural gas throughput less than 28.3 thousand standard cubic meters per  day,   where glycol dehydration units are the only HAP emission source, is not  subject to the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be maintained  as required in Sec.  63.10(b)(3).
