                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. A number of foreign banks that are subject to the  Bank Holding Company Act (``BHC Act'') have participated as co-managers  in the underwriting of securities to be distributed in the United States  despite the fact that the foreign banks in question do not have  authority to engage in underwriting activity in the United States under  either the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (``GLB Act'') or section 4(c)(8) of  the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). This interpretation clarifies the  scope of existing restrictions on underwriting by such foreign banks  with respect to securities that are distributed in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Underwriting transactions engaged in by foreign banks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  the transactions in question, a foreign bank typically becomes a member  of the underwriting syndicate for securities that are registered and  intended to be distributed in the United States. The lead underwriter,  usually a registered U.S. broker-dealer not affiliated with the foreign  bank, agrees to be responsible for distributing the securities being  underwritten. The underwriting obligation is assumed by a foreign office  or affiliate of the foreign bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The foreign banks have used their U.S. offices or affiliates to  act as liaison with the U.S. issuer and the lead underwriter in the  United States, to prepare documentation and to provide other services in  connection with the underwriting. In some cases, the U.S. offices or  affiliates that assisted the foreign bank with the underwriting receive  a substantial portion of the revenue generated by the foreign bank's  participation in the underwriting. In other cases, the U.S. offices  receive ``credit'' from the head office of the foreign bank for their  assistance in generating profits arising from the underwriting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By assuming the underwriting risk and booking the underwriting  fees in their foreign offices or affiliates, the foreign banks are able  to take advantage of an exemption under U.S. securities laws; a foreign  underwriter is not required to register in the United States if the  underwriter either does not distribute any of the securities in the  United States or distributes them only through a registered broker- dealer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permissible scope of underwriting activities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A foreign bank  that is subject to the BHC Act may engage in underwriting activities in  the United States only if it has been authorized under section 4 of the  Act. The foreign banks in question have argued that they are not engaged  in underwriting activity in the United States because the underwriting  activity takes place only outside the United States where the  transaction is booked. The foreign banks refer to Regulation K, which  defines ``engaged in business'' or ``engaged in activities'' to mean  conducting an activity through an office or subsidiary in the United  States. Because the underwriting is not booked in a U.S. office or  subsidiary, the banks   assert that the activity cannot be considered conducted in the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board believes that the position taken by the foreign banks  is not supported by the Board's regulations or policies. Section 225.124  of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.124(d)) states that a foreign  bank will not be considered to be engaged in the activity of  underwriting in the United States if the shares to be underwritten are  distributed outside the United States. In the transactions in question,  all of the securities to be underwritten by the foreign banks are  distributed in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regulation K (12 CFR part 211) was amended in 1985 to provide  clarification that a foreign bank may not own or control voting shares  of a foreign company that directly underwrites, sells or distributes  securities in the United States (emphasis added). 12 CFR  211.23(f)(5)(ii). In proposing this latter provision, the Board  clarified that no part of the prohibited underwriting process may take  place in the United States and that the prohibition on the activity does  not depend on the activity being conducted through an office or  subsidiary in the United States. Moreover, in the transactions in  question, there was significant participation by U.S. offices and  affiliates of the foreign banks in the underwriting process. In some  transactions, the foreign office at which the transactions were booked  did not have any documentation on the particular transactions; all  documentation was maintained in the United States office. In all cases,  the U.S. offices or affiliates provided virtually all technical support  for participation in the underwriting process and benefitted from  profits generated by the activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The fact that some technological and regulatory constraints on  the delivery of cross-border services into the United States have been  eliminated since the Regulation K definition of ``engaged in business''  was adopted in 1979 creates greater scope for banking organizations to  deal with customers outside the U.S. bank regulatory framework. The  definition in Regulation K, however, does not authorize foreign banking  organizations to evade regulatory restrictions on securities activities  in the United States by directly underwriting securities to be  distributed in the United States or by using U.S. offices and affiliates  to facilitate the prohibited activity. In the GLB Act, Congress  established a framework within which both domestic and foreign banking  organizations may underwrite and deal in securities in the United  States. The GLB Act requires that banking organizations meet certain  financial and managerial requirements in order to be able to engage in  these activities in the United States. The Board believes the practices  described above undermine this legislative framework and constitute an  evasion of the requirements of the GLB Act and the Board's Regulation K.  Foreign banking organizations that wish to conduct securities  underwriting activity in the United States have long had the option of  obtaining section 20 authority and now have the option of obtaining  financial holding company status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conclusion. The Board finds that the underwriting of securities  to be distributed in the United States is an activity conducted in the  United States, regardless of the location at which the underwriting risk  is assumed and the underwriting fees are booked. Consequently, any  banking organization that wishes to engage in such activity must either  be a financial holding company under the GLB Act or have authority to  engage in underwriting activity under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act  (so-called ``section 20 authority''). Revenue generated by underwriting  bank-ineligible securities in such transactions should be attributed to  the section 20 company for those foreign banks that operate under  section 20 authority.
