The OCC may determine that activities are permissible under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) or other statutory authority only if they are subject to standards or conditions designed to provide that the activities function as intended and are conducted safely and soundly, in accordance with other applicable statutes, regulations, or supervisory policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Activities that are part of the business of banking. (1) An activity is authorized for national banks as part of the business of banking if the activity is described in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) or other statutory authority. In determining whether an electronic activity is part of the business of banking, the OCC considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An activity is authorized for national banks as part of the business of banking if the activity is described in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) or other statutory authority.

(1) An electronic banking activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of banking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national banks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking. In determining whether an activity is convenient or useful to such activities, the OCC considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An electronic banking activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of banking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national banks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking. In determining whether an activity is convenient or useful to such activities, the OCC considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the activity facilitates the production or delivery of a bank's products or services, enhances the bank's ability to sell or market its products or services, or improves the effectiveness or efficiency of the bank's operations, in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, techniques and new technologies for producing and delivering financial products and services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the activity enables the bank to use capacity acquired for its banking operations or otherwise avoid economic loss or waste.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the electronic activities specifically permitted in Sec. 7.5004 (sale of excess electronic capacity and by-products) and Sec. 7.5006 (incidental non-financial data processing), the OCC has determined that the following electronic activities are incidental to the business of banking, pursuant to this section.
