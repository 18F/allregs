                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Closed vent system records. For closed vent systems, the owner  or operator shall record the following information, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as  applicable. The information shall be reported as specified in Sec.  65.166(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> was operating and whether a diversion was detected  at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all  periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the  flow indicator is not operating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, hourly records of flow are not required. In such  cases, the owner or operator shall record that the monthly visual  inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done and shall  record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken,  the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and- key type lock has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has  been broken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> or (b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (vi) of this section shall be recorded.  The data shall be reported as specified in Sec. 65.166(b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The instrument and the equipment identification number and the  operator name, initials, or identification number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the leak was detected and the date of the first  attempt to repair the leak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date of successful repair of the leak.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The maximum instrument reading measured by the procedures in  Sec. 65.143(c) after the leak is successfully repaired or determined to  be nonrepairable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ``Repair delayed'' and the reason for the delay if a leak is not  repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak. The owner  or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the  conditions that justify a delay of repair. In such cases, reasons for  delay of repair may be documented   by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Copies of the periodic reports if records are not maintained on  a computerized database capable of generating summary reports from the  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each instrumental or visual inspection conducted in  accordance with Sec. 65.143(b)(1) for closed vent systems collecting  regulated material from a storage vessel, transfer rack, or equipment  leaks during which no leaks are detected, the owner or operator shall  record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection,  and a statement that no leaks were detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For instrument response factor criteria determinations performed  pursuant to Sec. 65.143(c)(1)(ii), the owner or operator shall maintain  a record of an engineering assessment that identifies the representative  composition of the process fluid. This assessment shall be based on  knowledge of the compounds present in the process, similarity of  response factors for the materials present, the range of compositions  encountered during monitoring, or other information available to the  owner or operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record of the measured values of the parameters monitored in  accordance with Sec. 65.145(c)(2) and report in the periodic report as  specified in Sec. 65.166(e), if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>  through (iii) of this section. This information shall be submitted in  the periodic reports as specified in Sec. 65.166(d)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first time of day and date the requirements of Sec.  65.143(a), Sec. 65.145(a), or Sec. 65.147(a), as applicable, were not  met at the beginning of the planned routine maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The first time of day and date the requirements of Sec.  65.143(a), Sec. 65.145(a), or Sec. 65.147(a), as applicable, were met  at the conclusion of the planned routine maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the type of maintenance performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bypass records for storage vessel emissions routed to a process  or fuel gas system. An owner or operator who uses the bypass provisions  of Sec. 65.144(a)(2) shall keep in a readily accessible location the  following records:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reason it was necessary to bypass the process equipment or  fuel gas system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The duration of the period when the process equipment or fuel  gas system was bypassed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documentation or certification of compliance with the  applicable provisions of Sec. 65.42(b)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulated source and control equipment startup, shutdown and  malfunction records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records of the occurrence and duration of each  startup, shutdown, and malfunction of process equipment or of air  pollution control equipment used to comply with this part during which  excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 65.3(a)(4)) occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess  emissions occur, records whether the procedures specified in the  source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and a  description of actions taken to minimize emissions. For example, if a  startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing  control device emissions to a backup control device (for example, the  incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during  periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must  be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the  form of a checklist or other form of recordkeeping that confirms  conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the  event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and continuous  monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they  pertain solely to Group 2A process vents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> of this section shall be kept as long as  the equipment is in operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following design specifications and performance  demonstrations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Detailed schematics, design specifications of the control  device, and piping and instrumentation diagrams.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The dates and descriptions of any changes in the design  specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the parameter or parameters monitored as  required in Sec. 65.146(c) to ensure that control devices are operated  and maintained in conformance with their design, and an explanation of  why that parameter (or parameters) was selected for the monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following records of operation of closed vent systems and  control devices:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dates and durations when the closed vent systems and control  devices required in Sec. 65.115(b) are not operated as designed as  indicated by the monitored parameters, including periods when a flare  flame or at least one pilot flame is not present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dates and durations during which the monitoring system or  monitoring device is inoperative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dates and durations of startups and shutdowns of control  devices required in Sec. 65.115(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.
