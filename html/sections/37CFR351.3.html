                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Declaration of controversy. If a settlement has not been reached  within the voluntary negotiation period, the Copyright Royalty Judges  will issue an order declaring that further proceedings are necessary.  The procedures set forth at Sec. Sec.  351.5, et seq., for formal  hearings will apply, unless the abbreviated procedures set forth in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are invoked by the Copyright  Royalty Judges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Small claims in distribution proceedings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If, in a  distribution proceeding, the contested amount of a claim is $10,000 or  less, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall decide the controversy on the  basis of the filing of the written direct statement by each participant  (or participant group filing a joint petition), the response by any  opposing participant, and one optional reply by a participant who has  filed a written direct statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bad faith inflation of claim. If the Copyright Royalty Judges  determine that a participant asserts in bad faith an amount in  controversy in excess of $10,000 for the purpose of avoiding a  determination under the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall impose a fine on that  participant in an amount not to exceed the difference between the actual  amount distributed and the amount asserted by the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Paper proceedings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard. The procedure under this  paragraph (c) will be applied in cases in which there is no genuine  issue of material fact, there is no need for evidentiary hearings, and  all participants in the proceeding agree in writing to the procedure. In  the absence of an agreement in writing among all participants, this  procedure may be applied by the Copyright Royalty Judges either on the  motion of a party or by the Copyright Royalty Judges sua sponte.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure. Paper proceedings will be decided on the basis of the  filing of the written direct statement by the participant (or  participant group filing a joint petition), the response by any opposing  participant, and one optional reply by a participant who has filed a  written direct statement.
