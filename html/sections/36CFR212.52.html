The public shall be allowed to participate in the  designation of National Forest System roads, National Forest System  trails, and areas on National Forest System lands and revising those  designations pursuant to this subpart. Advance notice shall be given to  allow for public comment, consistent with agency procedures under the  National Environmental Policy Act, on proposed designations and  revisions. Public notice with no further public involvement is  sufficient if a National Forest or Ranger District has made previous  administrative decisions, under other authorities and including public  involvement, which restrict motor vehicle use over the entire National  Forest or Ranger District to designated routes and areas, and no change  is proposed to these previous decisions and designations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Absence of public involvement in temporary, emergency closures-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Nothing in this section shall alter or limit the authority  to implement temporary, emergency closures pursuant to 36 CFR part 261,  subpart B, without advance public notice to provide short-term resource  protection or to protect public health and safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Temporary, emergency closures based on a determination of  considerable adverse effects. If the responsible official determines  that motor vehicle use on a National Forest System road or National  Forest System trail or in an area on National Forest System lands is  directly causing or will directly cause considerable adverse effects on  public safety or soil, vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitat, or  cultural resources associated with that road, trail, or area, the  responsible official shall immediately close that road, trail, or area  to motor vehicle use until the official determines that such adverse  effects have been mitigated or eliminated and that measures have been  implemented to prevent future recurrence. The responsible official shall  provide public notice of the closure pursuant to 36 CFR 261.51,  including   reasons for the closure and the estimated duration of the closure, as  soon as practicable following the closure.</p>
