The appropriate TTB officer is authorized to compromise such liabilities. Persons desiring to submit offers in compromise may submit such offers on Form 5640.2. When the offer is acted upon, the proponent is notified of the acceptance or rejection of the offer. If the offer is rejected, the sum submitted with the offer in compromise is returned to the proponent. If the offer is accepted, the proponent is notified and the case is closed.
