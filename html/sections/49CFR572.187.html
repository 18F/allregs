For purposes of this test, the lumbar spine is mounted within the headform assembly 175-9000 as shown in Figure U1 in appendix A to this subpart. When subjected to tests procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the lumbar spine-headform assembly shall meet performance requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure.

Rotation of the headform-neck assembly shall be measured with potentiometers specified in Sec. 572.189(c), installed as shown in drawing 175-9000, and calculated per procedure specified in Figure U2-B in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The decaying headform rotation vs. time curve shall cross the zero angle with respect to its initial position at impact relative to the pendulum centerline between 37 ms to 57 ms after the time the peak translation-rotation value is reached.
