                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Live swine, pork, or pork products and ship stores, airplane meals, and baggage containing pork or pork products, other than those articles regulated under part 95 or part 96 of this chapter, may not be imported into the United States from a region listed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section unless the requirements in this section, in addition to other applicable requirements of part 93 of this chapter and part 327 of this title, are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regions listed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section have been declared free of classical swine fever (CSF) by APHIS in accordance with Sec. Sec. 94.9(a) and 94.10(a) but either supplement their pork supplies with fresh (chilled or frozen) pork imported from regions considered to be affected by CSF, or supplement their pork supplies with pork from CSF-affected regions that is not processed in accordance with the requirements of this part, or share a common land border with CSF-affected regions, or import live swine from CSF-affected regions under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Thus, the live swine, pork, or pork products from those regions may be commingled with live swine, pork, or pork products from CSF-affected regions, resulting in a risk of CSF introduction into the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of regions whose live swine, pork, and pork products are regulated under this section is maintained on the APHIS Web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/animals/animal--disease--status.shtml. Copies of the list will also be available via postal mail, fax, or email upon request to the Sanitary Trade Issues Team, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> APHIS will add a region to the list of those whose live swine, pork, and pork products are regulated under this section after conducting an evaluation of the region and determining that one or more of the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exists. APHIS will remove a region from the list upon conducting an evaluation of the region and determining that the circumstances in paragraph (a)(1) of this section no longer exist or upon determining that classical swine fever exists in the region.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Live swine. The swine must be accompanied by a certification issued by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of export. Upon arrival of the swine in the United States, the certification must be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival. The certification must identify both the exporting region and the region of origin as a region listed under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as free of CSF at the time the swine were in the region and must state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The swine have not lived in a region classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The swine have never been commingled with swine that have been in a region that is classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The swine have not transited a region classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist unless moved directly through the region to their destination in a sealed means of conveyance with the seal intact upon arrival at the point of destination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The conveyances or materials used in transporting the swine, if previously used for transporting swine, have been cleaned and disinfected in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 93.502 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pork or pork products. The pork or pork products must be accompanied by a certification issued by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of export. Upon arrival of the pork or pork products in the United States, the certification must be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival. The certification must identify both the exporting region and the region of origin of the pork or pork products as a region listed under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as free of CSF at the time the pork or pork products were in the region and must state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pork or pork products were derived from swine that were born and raised in a region listed under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as free of CSF and were slaughtered in such a region at a federally inspected slaughter plant that is under the direct supervision of a full-time salaried veterinarian of the national government of that region and that is eligible to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the regulations in Sec. 327.2 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pork or pork products were derived from swine that have not lived in a region classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pork or pork products have never been commingled with pork or pork products that have been in a region that is classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The pork or pork products have not transited through a region classified under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as a region in which CSF is known to exist unless moved directly through the region to their destination in a sealed means of conveyance with the seal intact upon arrival at the point of destination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If processed, the pork or pork products were processed in a region listed under Sec. Sec. 94.9 and 94.10 as free of CSF in a federally inspected processing plant that is under the direct supervision of a full-time salaried veterinary official of the national government of that region.
