Sec. 205.54-1  Low speed sound emission test procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Instrumentation. The following instrumentation shall be used, where applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A sound level meter which meets the Type 1 requirements of ANSI S1.4-1971, Specification for Sound Level Meters, or a sound level meter may be used with a magnetic tape recorder and/or a graphic level recorder or indicating meter, providing the system meets the requirements of Sec. 205.54-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A sound level calibrator. The calibrator shall produce a sound pressure level, at the microphone diaphragm, that is known to within an accuracy of 0.5 dB. The calibrator shall be checked annually to verify that its output has not changed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An engine-speed tachometer which is accurate within 2 percent of meter reading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An anemometer or other device for measurement of ambient wind speed accurate within 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A thermometer for measurement of ambient temperature accurate within 1 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A barometer for measurement of ambient pressure accurate within 1 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The test site shall be such that the truck radiates sound into a free field over a reflecting plane. This condition may be considered fulfilled if the test site consists of an open space free

of large reflecting surfaces, such as parked vehicles, signboards, buildings or hillsides, located within 100 feet (30.4 meters) of either the vehicle path or the microphone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The test site shall be such that the truck radiates sound into a free field over a reflecting plane. This condition may be considered fulfilled if the test site consists of an open space free

of large reflecting surfaces, such as parked vehicles, signboards, buildings or hillsides, located within 100 feet (30.4 meters) of either the vehicle path or the microphone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The microphone shall be located 50 feet 4 in. (15.2 0.1 meter) from the centerline of truck travel and 4 feet 4 in. (1.2 0.1 meters) above the ground plane. The microphone point is defined as the point of intersection of the vehicle path and the normal to the vehicle path drawn from the microphone. The microphone shall be oriented in a fixed position to minimize the deviation from the flattest system response over the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 kHz for a vehicle traversing from the acceleration point through the end zone.
The microphone shall be oriented with respect to the source so that the sound strikes the diaphragm at the angle for which the microphone was calibrated to have the flattest frequency response characteristic over the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 kHz.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An acceleration point shall be established on the vehicle path 50 feet (15 m) before the microphone point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An end point shall be established on the vehicle path 100 feet (30 m) from the acceleration point and 50 feet (15 m) from the microphone point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The end zone is the last 40 feet (12 m) of vehicle path prior to the end point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The measurement area shall be the triangular paved (concrete or sealed asphalt) area formed by the acceleration point, the end point, and the microphone location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The reference point on the vehicle, to indicate when the vehicle is at any of the points on the vehicle path, shall be the front of the vehicle except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the horizontal distance from the front of the vehicle to the exhaust outlet is more than 200 inches (5.1 meters), tests shall be run using both the front and rear of the vehicle as reference points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the engine is located rearward to the center of the chassis, the rear of the vehicle shall be used as the reference point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The plane containing the vehicle path and the microphone location (plane ABCDE in Figure 1) shall be flat within 2 inches (.05 meters).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Measurements shall not be made when the road surface is wet, covered with snow, or during precipitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Bystanders have an appreciable influence on sound level meter readings when they are in the vicinity of the vehicle or microphone; therefore not more than one person, other than the observer reading the meter, shall be within 50 feet (15.2 meters) of the vehicle path or instrument and the person shall be directly behind the observer reading the meter, on a line through the microphone and observer. To minimize the effect of the observer and the container of the sound level meter electronics on the measurements, cable should be used between the microphone and the sound level meter. No observer shall be located within 1 m in any direction of the microphone location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The maximum A-weighted fast response sound level observed at the test site immediately before and after the test shall be at least 10 dB below the regulated level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The road surface within the test site upon which the vehicle travels, and, at a minimum, the measurements area (BCD in figure 205.1) shall be smooth concrete or smooth sealed asphalt, free of extraneous material such as gravel.

Generally, recorders of adequate quality to provide the frequency response performance required will also meet other minimum requirements for distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Graphic level recorder dynamic response. When using a graphic level recorder, it is necessary to select pen response settings such that the readings obtained are statistically equivalent to those obtained by directly reading a meter which meets the ``fast'' dynamic requirement of a precision sound level meter indicating meter system for the range of vehicles to be tested. To ensure statistical equivalence, at least 30 comparative observations of real test data shall be made and the average of the absolute value of the differences observed shall be less than 0.5 dB. The settings described in this paragraph likely assure appropriate dynamic response; however, different settings may be selected on the basis of the above requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use a pen writing speed of nominally 60-100 dB/sec.

(i) Typical noise measurement and analysis configurations are shown in Figures 205.2 through 205.4. The qualification procedure described herein duplicates these configurations, but with the microphone replaced by an electronic sinewave oscillator. Caution should be exercised when connecting an oscillator to the input of a sound level meter to ensure, perhaps by using a resistive voltage divider network, that the input is not overloaded (see Sec. 205.54-2(a)(2)(ii)).

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01FE92.053</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calibrate the oscillator to be used by measuring its output relative to the voltage which is equivalent to 86 dB sound level at each of the 27 frequencies listed in Table 205.1 using an electronic voltmeter of known calibration. Record the result in voltage level in dB re voltage corresponding to 86 dB

sound level at 1000 Hz. This will describe the frequency response characteristics of the oscillator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a graphic level recorder is to be used, connect it to the oscillator output. If the oscillator and graphic level recorder can be synchronized, slowly sweep the frequency over the range of 31.5 to 12,500 Hz, recording the oscillator output. If they cannot be synchronized, record oscillator output for signals at the 27 frequencies given in Table 205.1. The differences between the combined response thus obtained and the oscillator response obtained previously will describe the frequency response of the graphic level recorder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If visual observation of an indicating meter is to be used for obtaining data, the oscillator should be connected to the indicating meter input (such as the microphone input of a sound level meter) and the meter reading observed for a fixed oscillator output voltage setting for signals at the 27 frequencies given in Table 205.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> To check a tape recorder, connect the instruments as shown in Figure 205.4. Using a 1000 Hz tone, adjust the oscillator output level to obtain a reading 15 dB below maximum record level. If the synchronized oscillator/graphic level recorder system is to be used for analysis, record an oscillator sweep over the range of 31.5 to 12,500 Hz, using an appropriate tape recorder input attenuator setting. Alternatively, tape-record frequency tones at the 27 frequencies given in Table 205.1. Replay the tape recordings using the setup shown in Figure 205.3. Record the data on a graphic level recorder or through visual observation of the indicating meter. Subtract the oscillator frequency response in paragraph (b)(2) of this section from the response obtained through the record-playback sequence to obtain the record/reproduce frequency response of the system except for the microphone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> To obtain the overall system frequency response, add the manufacturer's microphone calibration data to the response just obtained. This may be the frequency response for the specific microphone to be used, including calibration tolerances. Alternatively, use the manufacturer's ``typical'' microphone response plus and minus the maximum deviation expected from ``typical'' including calibration tolerances. Use the microphone response curve which corresponds to the manner in which it is used in the field. It may be required to add a correction to the response curves provided to obtain field response; refer to the manufacturer's manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Adjustment or repair of equipment may be required to obtain response within the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. After any adjustments, the system shall be requalified according to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> General comments. (i) Calibrate tape recorders using the brand and type of magnetic tape used for actual data acquisition. Differences in tape can cause an appreciable variation in the recorder/reproduce frequency response characteristics of tape recorder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It shall be ensured that the instrumentation used will perform within specifications and applicable tolerances over the temperature, humidity, and other environmental variation ranges which may be encountered in vehicle noise measurement works.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Qualification tests shall be performed using equipment (including cables) and recording and playback techniques identical with those used while recording vehicle noise. For example, if weighted sound level data are normally recorded use similar weighting and apply the tolerances of Table 205.1 to the weighting curve for comparison with record-playback curves. Precautions should also be taken to ensure that source and load impedances are appropriate to the device being tested. Other data acquisition systems may use any combination of microphones, sound level meters, amplifiers, tape recorders, graphic level recorders, or indicating meters. The same approach to qualifying such a system shall be taken as described in this document for the systems depicted in Figures 205.2, 205.3 and 205.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Systems other than those specified in Sec. Sec. 205.54-1(a) and 205.54-2(a) may be used for establishing compliance with this regulation. In each case the system must yield sound levels which are equivalent to those produced by a sound level meter Type 1 ANSI S1.4-

1971. The manufacturer bears the burden of demonstrating such equivalence.
