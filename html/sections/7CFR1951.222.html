However, a new report need not be obtained if there is an appraisal report not over one year old which permits a proper determination of the present market value of the total property after the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The proposed action must not change the nature of the borrower's activities so as to make it ineligible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Necessary consent and subordination of all other outstanding security interests must be obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorities.
