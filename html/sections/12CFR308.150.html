Transcripts of testimony, if any, shall be recorded by an official reporter, or by any other person or means designated by the person conducting the investigation. A witness may, solely for the use and benefit of the witness, obtain a copy of the transcript of his or her testimony at the conclusion of the investigation or, at the discretion of the person conducting the investigation, at an earlier time, provided that the witness submits a written request for the transcript and the transcript is available. The witness requesting a copy of his or her testimony shall bear the cost thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subscription by witness. The transcript of testimony shall be subscribed by the witness, unless the person conducting the investigation and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the transcript of the testimony is not subscribed by the witness, the official reporter taking the testimony shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the testimony.
