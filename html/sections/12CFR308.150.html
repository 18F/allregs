Transcripts of testimony, if any, in an  investigation pursuant to section 10(c) shall be recorded by an official  reporter, or by any other person or means designated by the person  conducting the investigation. A witness may, solely for the use and  benefit of the witness, obtain a copy of the transcript of his or her  testimony at the conclusion of the investigation or, at the discretion  of the person conducting the investigation, at an earlier time, provided  the transcript is available. The witness requesting a copy of his or her  testimony shall bear the cost thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subscription by witness. The transcript of testimony shall be  subscribed by the witness, unless the person conducting the  investigation and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing,  or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the  transcript of the testimony is not subscribed by the witness, the  official reporter taking the testimony shall certify that the transcript  is a true and complete transcript of the testimony.</p>
