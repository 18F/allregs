                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State plan requirements. A State plan under title IV-A of the Social Security Act shall provide that (1) procedures are in effect to ensure that no undue delays occur in issuing a replacement check; and (2) when applicable, prior to the issuance of a replacement check, the State agency must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Issue a stop payment order on the original AFDC check through appropriate banking procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Require recipients to execute a signed statement attesting to the nonreceipt, loss, or theft of the original FDC check. However, if obtaining such a statement from the recipient will cause the issuance of the check to be unduly delayed, the statement may be obtained within a reasonable time after the check is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State option. A State plan may provide that as a condition for issuance of a replacement check, a recipient is required to report a lost or stolen AFDC check to the police or other appropriate authorities. Under this provision, the State agency may require that the recipient verify that a report was made to the police or other appropriate authorities and, if so, the agency will establish procedures for such verification.
