                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority. This part is established under authority of the  Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Under the FFDCA, the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) can enforce the food adulteration provisions  under 21 U.S.C. 331 through 334 and 342. Under the PHS Act (42 U.S.C.  264), FDA has the authority to make and enforce regulations for the  control of communicable diseases. FDA has established the following  administrative enforcement procedures for the diversion or destruction  of shell eggs and for informal hearings under the PHS Act:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon a finding that any shell eggs have been produced or held in  violation   of this part, an authorized FDA representative or a State or local  representative in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section may  order such eggs to be diverted, under the supervision of said  representative, for processing in accordance with the Egg Products  Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031 et seq.) or by a treatment that  achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE or destroyed by or under the  supervision of an officer or employee of FDA, or, if applicable, of the  State or locality in accordance with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Order for diversion or destruction under the PHS Act. Any  district office of FDA or any State or locality acting under paragraph  (c) of this section, upon finding shell eggs that have been produced or  held in violation of this regulation, may serve a written order upon the  person in whose possession the eggs are found requiring that the eggs be  diverted, under the supervision of an officer or employee of the issuing  entity, for processing in accordance with the EPIA (21 U.S.C. 1031 et  seq.) or by a treatment that achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE  or destroyed by or under the supervision of the issuing entity, within  10-working days from the date of receipt of the order, unless, under  paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, a hearing is held, in which case  the eggs must be diverted or destroyed consistent with the decision of  the Regional Food and Drug Director under paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this  section. The order must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the shell eggs identified in the order are  subject to diversion for processing in accordance with the EPIA or by a  treatment that achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE or  destruction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A detailed description of the facts that justify the issuance of  the order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The location of the eggs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A statement that these eggs must not be sold, distributed, or  otherwise disposed of or moved except as provided in paragraph  (a)(1)(iv) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Identification or description of the eggs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The order number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The date of the order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The text of this entire section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> A statement that the order may be appealed by written appeal or  by requesting an informal hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> The name and phone number of the person issuing the order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> The location and telephone number of the office or agency  issuing the order and the name of its Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approval of District Director. An order, before issuance, must  be approved by FDA's District Director or the Acting District Director.  If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval must be  obtained and confirmed by written memorandum as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Labeling or marking of shell eggs under order. An FDA, State,  or local representative issuing an order under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of  this section must label or mark the shell eggs with official tags that  include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the shell eggs are detained in accordance with  regulations issued under section 361(a) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C.  264(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the shell eggs must not be sold, distributed or  otherwise disposed of or moved except, after notifying the issuing  entity in writing, to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Divert them for processing in accordance with the EPIA or by a  treatment that achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE or destroy  them or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Move them to another location for holding pending appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A statement that the violation of the order or the removal or  alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both  (section 368 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 271)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The order number and the date of the order, and the name of the  government representative who issued the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sale or other disposition of shell eggs under order. After  service of the order, the person in possession of the shell eggs that  are the subject of the   order must not sell, distribute, or otherwise dispose of or move any  eggs subject to the order unless and until receiving a notice that the  order is withdrawn after an appeal except, after notifying FDA's  district office or, if applicable, the State or local representative, in  writing, to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Divert or destroy them as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of  this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Move them to another location for holding pending appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person on whom the order for diversion or destruction is  served may either comply with the order or appeal the order to the  Regional Food and Drug Director in accordance with the following  procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Appeal of a detention order. Any appeal must be submitted in  writing to FDA's District Director in whose district the shell eggs are  located within 5-working days of the issuance of the order. If the  appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, the hearing must be  held within 5-working days after the appeal is filed or, if requested by  the appellant, at a later date, which must not be later than 20-calendar  days after the issuance of the order. The order may also be appealed  within the same period of 5-working days by any other person having an  ownership or proprietary interest in such shell eggs. The appellant of  an order must state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant  has in the shell eggs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Summary decision. A request for a hearing may be denied, in  whole or in part and at any time after a request for a hearing has been  submitted, if the Regional Food and Drug Director or his or her designee  determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact has been raised  by the material submitted in connection with the hearing or from matters  officially noticed. If the Regional Food and Drug Director determines  that a hearing is not justified, written notice of the determination  will be given to the parties explaining the reason for denial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Informal hearing. Appearance by any appellant at the hearing  may be by mail or in person, with or without counsel. The informal  hearing must be conducted by the Regional Food and Drug Director or his  designee, and a written summary of the proceedings must be prepared by  the Regional Food and Drug Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Regional Food and Drug Director may direct that the hearing  be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and by this  section. The Regional Food and Drug Director has the power to take such  actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to  maintain order and to conduct an informal, fair, expeditious, and  impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements concerning the  conduct of hearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement  of the action that is the subject of the hearing, together with the  information and reasons supporting it, and may present oral or written  information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing  may then present oral or written information relevant to the hearing.  All parties may conduct reasonable examination of any person (except for  the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any  statement on the matter at the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of  evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the  admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but  any party may comment upon or rebut any information and views presented  by another party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing  transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the  transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will  be included with the Regional Food and Drug Director's report of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The Regional Food and Drug Director must prepare a written  report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing  will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the Regional Food  and Drug Director may give the parties the opportunity to review and  comment on the report of the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The Regional Food and Drug Director must include as part of the  report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other  than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is   a material issue, and must include a recommended decision, with a  statement of reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Written appeal. If the appellant appeals the detention order  but does not request a hearing, the Regional Food and Drug Director must  render a decision on the appeal affirming or revoking the detention  order within 5-working days after the receipt of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Regional Food and Drug Director decision. If, based on the  evidence presented at the hearing or by the appellant in a written  appeal, the Regional Food and Drug Director finds that the shell eggs  were produced or held in violation of this section, he must affirm the  order that they be diverted, under the supervision of an officer or  employee of FDA for processing under the EPIA or by a treatment that  achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE or destroyed by or under the  supervision of an officer or employee of FDA; otherwise, the Regional  Food and Drug Director must issue a written notice that the prior order  is withdrawn. If the Regional Food and Drug Director affirms the order,  he must order that the diversion or destruction be accomplished within  10-working days from the date of the issuance of his decision. The  Regional Food and Drug Director's decision must be accompanied by a  statement of the reasons for the decision. The decision of the Regional  Food and Drug Director constitutes final agency action, subject to  judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> No appeal. If there is no appeal of the order and the person in  possession of the shell eggs that are subject to the order fails to  divert or destroy them within 10-working days, or if the demand is  affirmed by the Regional Food and Drug Director after an appeal and the  person in possession of such eggs fails to divert or destroy them within  10-working days, FDA's district office or, if applicable, the State or  local representative may designate an officer or employee to divert or  destroy such eggs. It shall be unlawful to prevent or to attempt to  prevent such diversion or destruction of the shell eggs by the  designated officer or employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inspection. Persons engaged in production of shell eggs must  permit authorized representatives of FDA to make, at any reasonable  time, an inspection of the egg production establishment in which shell  eggs are being produced. Such inspection includes the inspection and  sampling of shell eggs and the environment, the equipment related to  production of shell eggs, the equipment in which shell eggs are held,  and examination and copying of any records relating to such equipment or  eggs, as may be necessary in the judgment of such representatives to  determine compliance with the provisions of this section. Inspections  may be made with or without notice and will ordinarily be made during  regular business hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> State and local cooperation. Under sections 311 and 361 of the  Public Health Service Act, any State or locality that is willing and  able to assist the agency in the enforcement of Secs. 118.4 through  118.10, and is authorized to inspect or regulate egg production  establishments, may, in its own jurisdiction, enforce Secs. 118.4  through 118.10 through inspections under paragraph (b) of this section  and through administrative enforcement remedies specified in paragraph  (a) of this section unless FDA notifies the State or locality in writing  that such assistance is no longer needed. A state or locality may  substitute, where necessary, appropriate State or local officials for  designated FDA officials in this section. When providing assistance  under paragraph (a) of this section, a State or locality may follow the  hearing procedures set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) through (a)(2)(v)  of this section, or may utilize comparable State or local hearing  procedures if such procedures satisfy due process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Preemption. No State or local governing entity shall establish,  or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement  regarding prevention of SE in shell eggs during production, storage, or  transportation that is less stringent than those required by this part.</p>
