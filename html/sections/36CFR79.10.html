                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal Agency Official shall ensure that the Repository  Official makes the collection available for scientific, educational and  religious uses, subject to such terms and conditions as are necessary to  protect and preserve the condition, research potential, religious or  sacred importance, and uniqueness of the collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scientific and educational uses. A collection shall be made  available to qualified professionals for study, loan and use for such  purposes as in-house and traveling exhibits, teaching, public  interpretation, scientific analysis and scholarly research. Qualified  professionals would include, but not be limited to, curators,  conservators, collection managers, exhibitors, researchers, scholars,  archeological contractors and educators. Students may use a collection  when under the direction of a qualified professional. Any resulting  exhibits and publications shall acknowledge the repository as the  curatorial facility and the Federal agency as the owner or  administrator, as appropriate. When the collection is from Indian lands  and the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over  the lands wish to be identified, those individuals and the Indian tribe  shall also be acknowledged. Copies of any resulting publications shall  be provided to the Repository Official and the Federal Agency Official.  When Indian lands are involved, copies of such publications shall also  be provided to the Tribal Official and the Tribal Historic Preservation  Officer, if any, of the Indian tribe that owns or has jurisdiction over  such lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Religious uses. Religious remains in a collection shall be made  available to persons for use in religious rituals or spiritual  activities. Religious remains generally are of interest to medicine men  and women, and other religious practitioners and persons from Indian  tribes, Alaskan Native corporations, Native Hawaiians, and other  indigenous and immigrant ethnic, social   and religious groups that have aboriginal or historic ties to the lands  from which the remains are recovered, and have traditionally used the  remains or class of remains in religious rituals or spiritual  activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Terms and conditions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with section 9 of the  Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 470hh) and section  304 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 w-3), the  Federal Agency Official shall restrict access to associated records that  contain information relating to the nature, location or character of a  prehistoric or historic resource unless the Federal Agency Official  determines that such disclosure would not create a risk of harm, theft  or destruction to the resource or to the area or place where the  resource is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of  the referenced uniform regulations, demonstrate that the disclosure will  not create a risk of harm, theft or destruction to the resource or to  the area or place where the resource is located. Other persons generally  would include, but not be limited to, archeological contractors,  researchers, scholars, tribal representatives, Federal, State and local  agency personnel, and other persons who are studying the resource or  class or resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a collection is from Indian lands, the Federal Agency  Official shall place such terms and conditions as may be requested by  the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the  lands on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scientific, educational or religious uses of material remains;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Access to associated records that contain information relating  to the nature, location or character of the resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a collection is from a site on public lands that the  Federal Agency Official has determined is of religious or cultural  importance to any Indian tribe having aboriginal or historic ties to  such lands, the Federal Agency Official shall place such terms and  conditions as may have been developed pursuant to Sec. -.7 of uniform  regulations 43 CFR part 7, 36 CFR part 296, 18 CFR part 1312, and 32 CFR  part 229 on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scientific, educational or religious uses of material remains;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Access to associated records that contain information relating  to the nature, location or character of the resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Federal Agency Official shall not allow uses that would  alter, damage or destroy an object in a collection unless the Federal  Agency Official determines that such use is necessary for scientific  studies or public interpretation, and the potential gain in scientific  or interpretive information outweighs the potential loss of the object.  When possible, such use should be limited to unprovenienced, nonunique,  nonfragile objects, or to a sample of objects drawn from a larger  collection of similar objects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No collection (or a part thereof) shall be loaned to any person  without a written agreement between the Repository Official and the  borrower that specifies the terms and conditions of the loan. Appendix C  to the regulations in this part contains an example of a short-term loan  agreement for a federally-owned collection. At a minimum, a loan  agreement shall specify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The collection or object being loaned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of the loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The length of the loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any restrictions on scientific, educational or religious uses,  including whether any object may be altered, damaged or destroyed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, that the  borrower shall handle the collection or object being borrowed during the  term of the loan in accordance with this part so as not to damage or  reduce its scientific, educational, religious or cultural value; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any requirements for insuring the collection or object being  borrowed for any loss, damage or destruction during transit and while in  the borrower's possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Federal Agency Official shall ensure that the Repository  Official maintains administrative records that document approved  scientific, educational and religious uses of the collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Repository Official may charge persons who study, borrow or  use a collection (or a part thereof) reasonable fees to cover costs for  handling, packing, shipping and insuring material remains, for  photocopying associated records, and for other related incidental costs.</p>
