                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt by the Chief, Office of Customer Outreach and Oversight Staff, of a reasonably specific request made pursuant to Sec. 212.33 of this part, a maximum of ten working days will normally be taken to determine to what extent the Agency can provide the information requested. Upon the making of that determination, the person making the request will be promptly so informed. Copies of the releasable documents will be made available promptly thereafter upon receipt of applicable fees and charges as set forth in Sec. 212.35.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> In unusual circumstances, USAID may not be able to determine the availability of the requested documents within ten working days, in

which event the person making the request will be informed by written notice of the delay, the reasons for the delay and the date on which a determination may be expected. In this context, the term ``unusual circumstances'' refers to the following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In unusual circumstances, USAID may not be able to determine the availability of the requested documents within ten working days, in

which event the person making the request will be informed by written notice of the delay, the reasons for the delay and the date on which a determination may be expected. In this context, the term ``unusual circumstances'' refers to the following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When there is a need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When there is a need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are sought in a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When there is a need for consultation (which will be conducted with all practicable speed) with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Agency, each having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum time in making a determination of availability, in the event of such unusual circumstances, will be twenty working days from receipt of the request. In the event that only part of the permissible ten working days extension is used, then USAID reserves the right, if necessary, to use any remainder of such time for the determination of an appeal, if one is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a request is made to USAID for material that is controlled or held by another agency, the person making the request will be immediately notified that USAID does not have or control the requested material and he/she will be advised of the name of the controlling agency and of the address from which the material may be requested, unless the other agency has, by public regulation, delegated the release authority to USAID. If release authority has been delegated, USAID will follow the procedures authorized by the delegation in determining whether to release the information. If a request for material is referred to USAID from another agency, the time period for determination of release of the information will not start until the request is received by the Chief, Office of Customer Outreach and Oversight Staff; and the person making the request will be immediately notified of the referral and of the date the request was received in USAID. USAID will not accept referral of requests unless and until the Chief, Customer Outreach and Oversight Staff, or his/her designee, determines that the material requested is actually within the scope and control of the release authority of USAID.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If only a part of a record is exempt from disclosure, then any reasonably segregable portion of such record will be furnished after deletion of the portions which are exempt, provided that the segregable portion constitutes an intelligible record which is not distorted out of context or contradictory to the substance of the entire record before segregation.</p>
