whichever occurs first. The taxpayer's special tax stamp shall accompany the supplemental return for proper notation by the district director. As to liability in case of failure to register a change of address, see Sec. 44.4905-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before July 1, 1963. Whenever, before July 1, 1963, a taxpayer changes his business or residence address to a location other than that specified in his last return of Form 11-C, he shall, within 30 days after the date of such change, register the change with the district director from whom the special tax stamp was purchased by filing a new return, Form 11-C, designated ``Supplemental Return'', setting forth the new address and the date of change.

When registration of a change of address within the same district is made by a taxpayer in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the district director, if necessary, will enter on his records the new address and the date of change. If the information disclosed on the supplemental return is such as to require a change on the face of the special tax stamp, the district director will make the proper change and return the stamp to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure by district director; removal to another district. In case of removal of the taxpayer's office or principal place of business (or residence address, if he has no office or principal place of business) to another district, the district director, after noting the transfer on his records, shall transmit the special tax stamp to the district director for the district to which such office or business was removed. The latter will make an entry on his records, as in the case of an original registration in his district, correct the address on the stamp, if necessary, and note also thereon his name, title, date, and district, and then forward the stamp to the taxpayer.
