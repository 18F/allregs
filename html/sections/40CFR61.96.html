within an existing facility if the effective dose equivalent, caused by all emissions from the new construction or modification, is less than 1% of the standard prescribed in Sec. 61.92. For purposes of this paragraph the effective dose equivalent shall be calculated using the source term derived using appendix D as input to the dispersion and other computer models described in Sec. 61.93. DOE may, with prior approval from EPA, use another procedure for estimating the source term for use in this paragraph. A facility is eligible for this exemption only if, based on its last annual report, the facility is in compliance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions to approvals granted under Sec. 61.08 will not contain requirements for post approval reporting on operating conditions beyond those specified in Sec. 61.94.</p>
