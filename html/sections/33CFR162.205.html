                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> San Joaquin River Deep Water Channel between Suisun Bay and the  easterly end of the channel at Stockton; use, administration and  navigation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum speed. The maximum speed for all ocean-going  craft shall not exceed 10 miles per hour above the lower end of New York  Slough, seven miles per hour above Criminal Point, or five miles per  hour while passing any wharf, dock, or moored craft. As used in this  paragraph, the speed of a vessel when navigating with the current shall  be its rate of movement in excess of the velocity of the current.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Passing. All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., in  motion, moored or anchored, shall slow down and take every necessary  precaution to avoid damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Right of way. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> United States dredges, tugs, launches, derrick  boats, and similar plant of contractors executing river and harbor  improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals  prescribed by the regulations contained in part 80 of this chapter shall  have the right of way and other craft shall exercise special caution to  avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges,  whether Federal or contractors' plant, working the channel must however,  take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for  passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an  adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided. Ocean- going vessels may show at the masthead a black ball not more than 20  inches in diameter as a signal to the dredge, and may also blow five  long blasts of the   whistle when within reasonable hearing distance of the dredge, such  signal to be followed at the proper time by the passing signal described  in the local pilot rules. The dredge shall promptly acknowledge both  signals in the usual manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light-draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean- going vessels, shall give the right of way to such vessels by making use  of the shallower portions of the waterway.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rafts and tows must promptly give the channel side demanded  upon proper signal by a vessel, and must be handled in such a manner as  not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other  craft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collisions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel  or turning basin must, if still afloat and in a condition making  anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage  ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall  be temporarily beached on the northwest side of Mandeville Island or in  the Old River.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as  directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Wrecks. In no case following accidents of fire or collision will  a vessel be allowed to remain either anchored or grounded in the  channel, or beached at any place where it endangers other vessels, while  settlement is pending with the underwriters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other laws and regulations. In all other respects, the existing  Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the  United States will govern in this channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel between Suisun Bay and  easterly end of Turning Basin at West Sacramento; use, administration,  and navigation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum speed for all ocean going craft--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Between  Tolands Landing (Mile 6.2) and Rio Vista Bridge. When going against a  current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall  not exceed 8 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or  against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the  water shall not exceed 10 knots.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Between Rio Vista Bridge and Port of Sacramento. When going  against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the  bottom shall not exceed 5 knots. When going with the current, in slack  water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed  through the water shall not exceed 7 knots.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Speed past docks or moored craft. Within 550 feet of the  centerline of the channel the speed shall be the minimum required to  maintain steerageway; wind, tide, current, etc., being taken into  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Passing. All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc.,  underway, moored or anchored, shall take every necessary precaution to  avoid damage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Speed, high-water precautions. When passing another vessel  (underway, anchored, or tied up); a wharf or other structure; work under  construction; plant engaged in river and harbor improvement; levees  withstanding flood waters; buildings partially or wholly submerged by  high water; or any other structure liable to damage by collision,  suction or wave action; vessels shall give as much leeway as  circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude  causing damage to the vessel or structure being passed. As deemed  necessary for public safety during high river stages, floods, or other  emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe, by navigation  bulletins or other means, the limiting speed in knots or temporarily  close the waterway or any reach of it to traffic. Since this  subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are  operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict  observance and full compliance herewith.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Right of way. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats and  other similar equipment, executing river and harbor improvement work for  the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the  regulations contained in part 80, of this Chapter, shall have the right- of-way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid  interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges,  whether Federal or contractor's plant, working the channel must however,  take special   care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for passing, and must  lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an adequate width of  clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels intending to pass dredges or other types of floating  plant working in navigable channels, when within a reasonable distance  therefrom and not in any case over a mile, shall indicate such intention  by one long blast of the whistle, and shall be directed to the proper  side for passage by the sounding, by the dredge or other floating plant,  of the signal prescribed in the inland pilot rules for vessels underway  and approaching each other from opposite directions, which shall be  answered in the usual manner by the approaching vessel. If the channel  is not clear, the floating plant shall sound the alarm or danger signal  and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further  signal from the plant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the pipeline from a dredge crosses the channel in such a  way that an approaching vessel cannot pass safely around the pipeline or  dredge, there shall be sounded immediately from the dredge the alarm or  danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and  await further signal from the dredge. The pipeline shall then be opened  and the channel cleared as soon as practicable; when the channel is  clear for passage the dredge shall so indicate by sounding the usual  passing signal as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  The approaching vessel shall answer with a corresponding signal and pass  promptly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When any pipeline or swinging dredge shall have given an  approaching vessel or tow the signal that the channel is clear, the  dredge shall straighten out within the cut for the passage of the vessel  or tow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Shallow draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean- going vessels, shall give the right-of-way to such vessels by making use  of the shallower portions of the waterway, wherever possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Tows should promptly give the channel side requested by proper  signal from a vessel, and should be handled in such a manner as not to  obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obstruction of traffic. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section no person shall willfully or carelessly obstruct  the free navigation of the waterway, or delay any vessel having the  right to use the waterway.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No vessel shall anchor within the channel except in distress or  under stress of weather. Any vessel so anchored shall be moved as  quickly as possible to such anchorage as will leave the channel clear  for the passage of vessels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Motorboats, sailboats, rowboats, and other small craft shall  not anchor or drift in the regular ship channel except under stress of  weather or in case of breakdown. Such craft shall be so operated that  they will not interfere with or endanger the movement of commercial or  public vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collisions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel  or turning basin, must if still afloat and in a condition making  anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage  ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall  be temporarily beached on the southwest side of Ryer Island from Mile  15.0 to Mile 16.3 or in the Harbor and Turning Basin at West Sacramento.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as  directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Marine accidents. Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other  persons using the waterway to which this paragraph applies shall notify  the District Commander and in the case of undocumented vessels, the  State Division of Small Craft Harbors also, by the most expeditious  means available of all marine accidents, such as fire, collision,  sinking or stranding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel  or interference with navigation or where damage to Government property  is involved, furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and  ownership of the vessel or vessels involved, the time and place, and the  action taken. In all cases, the owner of the sunken vessel shall take  immediate steps to mark the wreck properly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other laws and regulations. In all other respects, existing  Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the  United States will govern in this channel.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The Corps of Engineers also has regulations dealing with this  section in 33 CFR Part 207.
