Interstate telecommunications include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cellular telephone and paging services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mobile radio services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operator services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Personal communications services (PCS);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Access to interexchange service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special access service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> WATS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Toll-free service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> 900 service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Message telephone service (MTS);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Private line service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Telex;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Telegraph;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Video services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Satellite service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Resale of interstate services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Payphone services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Interconnected VoIP services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Prepaid calling card providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, every entity required to contribute to the federal universal service support mechanisms under paragraph (a) of this section shall contribute on the basis of its projected collected interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues, net of projected contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any entity required to contribute to the federal universal service support mechanisms whose projected collected interstate end-user telecommunications revenues comprise less than 12 percent of its combined projected collected interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues shall contribute based only on such entity's projected collected interstate end-user telecommunications revenues, net of projected contributions. For purposes of this paragraph, an ``entity'' shall refer to the entity that is subject to the universal service reporting requirements in Sec. 54.711 and shall include all of that entity's affiliated providers of interstate and international telecommunications and telecommunications services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Entities providing open video systems (OVS), cable leased access, or direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services are not required to contribute on the basis of revenues derived from those services. The following entities will not be required to contribute to universal service: non-profit health care providers; broadcasters; systems integrators that derive less than five percent of their systems integration revenues from the resale of telecommunications. Prepaid calling card providers are not required to contribute on the basis of revenues derived from prepaid calling cards sold by, to, or pursuant to contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) or a DoD entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any entity required to contribute to the federal universal service support mechanisms shall retain, for at least five years from the date of the contribution, all records that may be required to demonstrate to auditors that the contributions made were in compliance with the Commission's universal service rules. These records shall include without limitation the following:

Financial statements and supporting documentation; accounting records; historical customer records; general ledgers; and any other relevant documentation. This document retention requirement also applies to any contractor or consultant working on behalf of the contributor.
