                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a witness will not be available for the  hearing, a party desiring to preserve that witness's testimony for the  record may request in accordance with the procedures set forth in this  section that the hearing officer issue a subpoena, including a subpoena  duces tecum, requiring the attendance of the witness at a deposition.  The hearing officer may issue a deposition subpoena under this section  upon a showing that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from  attending the hearing because of age, sickness, or infirmity, or will  otherwise be unavailable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The witness's unavailability was not procured or caused by the  subpoenaing party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to  any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to making a showing as required by paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, the request for a deposition subpoena must contain a  proposed deposition subpoena and a brief statement showing the general  relevance and reasonableness of the scope of testimony and documents  sought, and the time and place for taking the deposition. Any request to  record the deposition by audio-visual means must be made in the request  for a deposition subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any requested deposition subpoena that sets forth a valid basis  for its issuance must be promptly issued, unless the hearing officer on  his or her own motion requires a written response or requires attendance  at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena should be  issued. However, where it appears to the hearing officer that the  deposition subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in  scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as  a condition precedent to the issuance of the deposition subpoena,  require the person seeking the deposition subpoena to show further the  general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or   other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances,  the hearing officer determines that the deposition subpoena or any of  its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly  burdensome, he or she may refuse to issue the deposition subpoena, or  issue it only upon such conditions as fairness requires. In making the  foregoing determination, the hearing officer may inquire of the other  participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought to be  proved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless the hearing officer orders otherwise, no deposition under  this section shall be taken on fewer than 14 days' notice to the witness  and all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. Unless made on the record at a hearing, requests for  issuance of a deposition subpoena shall be made in writing, and filed  and served on each party pursuant to subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Signing may be delegated. A hearing officer may authorize  issuance of a deposition subpoena, and may delegate the manual signing  of the deposition subpoena to any other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service. Upon issuance by the hearing officer, the party making  the request shall serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena  and on each party in accordance with Sec. 1081.113(c). Deposition  subpoenas may be served in any State, territory, possession of the  United States, or the District of Columbia, on any person or company  doing business in any State, territory, possession of the United States,  or the District of Columbia, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tender of fees required. When a subpoena compelling the  attendance of a person at a deposition is issued at the request of  anyone other than an officer or agency of the United States, service is  valid only if the subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the subpoenaed  person of the fees for one day's attendance and mileage specified by  Sec. 1081.116.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Motion to quash or modify--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure. Any person to whom a  deposition subpoena is directed, or who is an owner, creator, or the  subject of the documents that are to be produced pursuant to a  deposition subpoena, or any party may, prior to the time specified  therein for compliance, but in no event more than ten days after the  date of service of such subpoena, move that the deposition subpoena be  quashed or modified. Such motion must include a statement of the basis  for the motion to quash or modify the deposition subpoena, and shall be  filed and served on all parties pursuant to subpart A of this part.  Notwithstanding Sec. 1081.205, the party on whose behalf the deposition  subpoena was issued or enforcement counsel may, within five days of  service of the motion, file a response to the motion. Reply briefs are  not permitted unless requested by the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standards governing motion to quash or modify. If compliance  with the deposition subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly  burdensome, or the deposition subpoena does not meet the requirements  set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the hearing officer shall  quash or modify the deposition subpoena, or may order return of the  deposition subpoena only upon specified conditions. These conditions may  include but are not limited to a requirement that the party on whose  behalf the deposition subpoena was issued shall make reasonable  compensation to the person to whom the deposition subpoena was addressed  for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for return  of the deposition subpoena.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Procedure upon deposition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Depositions shall be taken before  any person before whom a deposition may be taken pursuant to the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure (the ``deposition officer'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The witness being deposed may have an attorney present during  the deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must  be duly sworn, and each party shall have the right to examine the  witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form,  stating the grounds for the objection. Objections to questions of  evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer upon the deposition,  but a deposition officer other than the hearing officer shall not have  the power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevance of  evidence.   Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver  except where the ground for the objection might have been avoided if the  objection had been timely presented. All questions, answers, and  objections must be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the  parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the  witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the  deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking  the deposition shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete  transcript of the deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The original deposition transcript and exhibits shall be filed  with the Office of Administrative Adjudication. The cost of the  transcript shall be paid by the party requesting the deposition. A copy  of the deposition shall be available to the deponent and each party for  purchase at prescribed rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Enforcing subpoenas. Any party may move before the hearing  officer for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the  witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has  refused to submit during the deposition. If a subpoenaed person fails to  comply with any order of the hearing officer which directs compliance  with all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under this section, the  Bureau's General Counsel may, on its own motion or at the request of the  party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, apply to an appropriate  United States district court, in the name of the Bureau but on relation  of such party, for an order requiring compliance with so much of the  subpoena as the hearing officer has not quashed or modified, unless, in  the judgment of the General Counsel, the enforcement of such subpoena  would be inconsistent with law and the policies of title X of the Dodd- Frank Act. Failure to request that the Bureau seek enforcement of a  subpoena constitutes a waiver of any claim of prejudice predicated upon  the unavailability of the testimony or evidence sought.</p>
