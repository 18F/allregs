For copies of the ``Code of Best Practices for Ballast Water  Management'' and of the ``Voluntary Management Practices to Reduce the  Transfer of Aquatic Nuisance Species Within the Great Lakes by U.S. and  Canadian Domestic Shipping'' refer to the St. Lawrence Seaway Web site  at http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As a condition of transit of the Seaway after having operated  outside the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) every vessel that carries only  residual amounts of ballast water and/or sediment that were taken  onboard the vessel outside the EEZ shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a saltwater flushing of their ballast water tanks that  contain the residual amounts of ballast water and/or sediment in an area  200 nautical miles from any shore before entering waters of the Seaway.  Saltwater flushing is defined as the addition of mid-ocean water to  ballast water tanks: The mixing of the flushwater with residual water  and sediment through the motion of the vessel; and the discharge of the  mixed water, such that the resultant residual water remaining in the  tank has as high salinity as possible, and is at least 30 parts per  thousand (ppt). The vessel shall take on as much mid-ocean water into  each tank as is safe (for the vessel and crew) in order to conduct  saltwater flushing. And adequate flushing may require more than one  fill-mix-empty sequence, particularly if only small amounts of water can  be safely taken onboard at one time. The master of the vessel is  responsible for ensuring the safety of the vessel, crew, and passengers.  Vessels reporting only residual ballast water onboard shall take  particular care to conduct saltwater flushing on the transit to the  Great Lakes so as to eliminate fresh and or brackish water residuals in  ballast tanks; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintain the ability to measure salinity levels in each tank  onboard the vessel so that final salinities of at least 30 ppt can be  ensured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Every tank that is found not in compliance with 401.30(f) shall  retain any ballast water until it exits the Seaway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> These requirements do not apply to vessels of the armed forces,  as defined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or that are owned  or operated by a state and used in government noncommercial service.
