A contract proposal may be unsolicited by the federal government or submitted in response to a request for proposals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Development means the systematic use of knowledge gained from research to create useful materials, devices, systems, or methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> DHHS means the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Director means the Director of the National Institutes of Health and any other official or employee of the National Institutes of Health to whom the authority involved has been delegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Grant as used in this part, includes cooperative agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Peer review group means a group of primarily nongovernment experts qualified by training and experience in particular scientific or technical fields, or as authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review, to give expert advice on the scientific and technical merit of grant applications or contract proposals, or the concept of contract projects, in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Principal investigator has the same meaning as in 42 CFR part 52.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Professional associate means any colleague, scientific mentor, or student with whom the peer reviewer is currently conducting research or other significant professional activities or with whom the member has conducted such activities within three years of the date of the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Project approach means the methodology to be followed and the resources needed in carrying out the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Project concept means the basic purpose, scope, and objectives of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Project period has the same meaning as in 42 CFR part 52.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Real conflict of interest means a reviewer or a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer has a financial or other interest in an application or proposal that is known to the reviewer and is likely to bias the reviewer's evaluation of that application or proposal as determined by the government official managing the review (the Scientific Review Administrator, or equivalent), as acknowledged by the reviewer, or as prescribed by this part. A reviewer shall have a real conflict of interest if he/she or a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has received or could receive a direct financial benefit of any amount deriving from an application or proposal under review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Apart from any direct financial benefit deriving from an application or proposal under review, has received or could receive a financial benefit from

the applicant institution, offeror or principal investigator that in the aggregate exceeds $10,000 per year; this amount includes honoraria, fees, stock or other financial benefit, and additionally includes the current value of the reviewer's already existing stock holdings. The Director, NIH, may amend the dollar threshold periodically, as appropriate, after public notice and comment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Has any other interest in the application or proposal that is likely to bias the reviewer's evaluation of that application or proposal. Regardless of the level of financial involvement or other interest, if the reviewer feels unable to provide objective advice, he/she must recuse him/herself from the review of the application or proposal at issue.

Sec.  52h.3  Establishment and operation of peer review groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To the extent applicable, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 2) and chapter 9 of the DHHS General Administration Manual \1\ shall govern the establishment and operation of peer review groups.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The DHHS General Administration Manual is available for public inspection and copying at the Department's information centers listed in 45 CFR 5.31 and may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subject to Sec.  52h.5 and paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will adopt procedures for the conduct of reviews and the formulation of recommendations under Sec. Sec.  52h.7, 52h.9, and 52h.10.


Sec.  52h.4  Composition of peer review groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To the extent applicable, the selection and appointment of members of peer review groups and their terms of service shall be governed by chapter 9 of the DHHS General Administration Manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, members will be selected based upon their training and experience in relevant scientific or technical fields, or upon their qualifications as authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review, taking into account, among other factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The level of formal scientific or technical education completed or experience acquired by the individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the individual has engaged in relevant research, the capacities (e.g., principal investigator, assistant) in which the

individual has done so, and the quality of the research;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recognition as reflected by awards and other honors received from scientific and professional organizations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The need for the group to have included within its membership experts from various areas of specialization within relevant scientific or technical fields, or authorities knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the scientific areas under review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as otherwise provided by law, not more than one-fourth of the members of any peer review group to which this part applies may be officers or employees of the United States. Being a member of a scientific peer review group does not make an individual an officer or employee of the United States.


Sec.  52h.5  Conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section applies only to conflicts of interest involving members of peer review groups. This section does not cover individuals serving on National Advisory Councils or Boards, Boards of Scientific Counselors, or Program Advisory Committees who, if not already officers or employees of the United States, are special Government employees and covered by title 18 of the United States Code, the Office of Government Ethics Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635), and Executive Order 11222, as amended. For those federal employees serving on peer review groups, in accordance with Sec.  52h.4, the requirements of title 18 of the United States Code, 5 CFR part 2635 and Executive Order 12674, as modified by Executive Order 12731, apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A reviewer with a real conflict of interest must recuse him/herself from the review of the application or proposal, except as otherwise provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A reviewer who is a salaried employee, whether full-time or part-time, of the applicant institution, offeror, or principal investigator, or is negotiating for employment, shall be considered to have a real conflict of interest with regard to an application/proposal from that organization or principal investigator, except that the Director may determine there is no real conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest where the components of a large or multicomponent organization are sufficiently independent to constitute, in effect, separate organizations, provided that the reviewer has no responsibilities at the institution that would significantly affect the other component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where a reviewer's real conflict of interest is based upon the financial or other interest of a close relative or professional associate of the reviewer, that reviewer must recuse him/herself, unless the Director provides a waiver in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For contract proposal reviews, an individual with a real conflict of interest in a particular proposal(s) is generally not permitted to participate in the review of any proposals responding to the same request for proposals. However, if there is no other qualified reviewer available having that individual's expertise and that expertise is essential to ensure a competent and fair review, a waiver may be granted by the Director to permit that individual to serve as a reviewer of those proposals with which the reviewer has no conflict, while recusing him/herself from the review of any particular proposal(s) in which there is a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Director may waive any of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section relating to a real conflict of interest if the Director determines that there are no other practical means for securing appropriate expert advice on a particular grant or cooperative agreement application, contract project, or contract proposal, and that the real conflict of interest is not so substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of the advice to be provided by the reviewer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any appearance of a conflict of interest will result in recusal of the reviewer, unless the Director provides a waiver, determining that it would be difficult or impractical to carry out the review otherwise, and the integrity of the review process would not be impaired by the reviewer's participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When a peer review group meets regularly it is assumed that a relationship among individual reviewers in the group exists and that the group as a whole may not be objective about evaluating the work of one of its members. In such a case, a member's application or proposal shall be reviewed by another qualified review group to ensure that a competent and objective review is obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> When a member of a peer review group participates in or is present during the concept review of a contract proposal that occurs after release of the solicitation, as described under Sec.  52h.10(b), but before receipt of proposals, the member is not considered to have a real conflict of interest as described in paragraph (b) of this section, but is subject to paragraph (c) of this section concerning appearance of conflict of interest if the member is planning to respond to the solicitation. When the concept review occurs after receipt of proposals, paragraph (b) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> No member of a peer review group may participate in any review of a specific grant application or contract project for which the member has had or is expected to have any other responsibility or involvement (whether pre-award or post-award) as an officer or employee of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Director may periodically issue guidance to the government officials responsible for managing reviews and reviewers on what interests would constitute a real conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest.

Under these circumstances, the awarding official will not award a contract until peer review of the project concept and the proposals has been completed. The request for proposals shall state that the project concept will be reviewed by a peer review group and that no award will be made until the review is conducted and recommendations made based on that review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The awarding official may determine that peer review of the project concept for behavioral or biomedical research and development contracts is not needed if one of the following circumstances applies: the solicitation is to re-compete or extend a project that is within the scope of a current project that has been peer reviewed, or there is a Congressional authorization or mandate to conduct specific contract projects.
