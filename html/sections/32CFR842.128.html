Upon appeal, a settlement authority has the same authority specified in Sec. 842.128(a). The Judge Advocate General is the final appellate authority on subpart F type claims without right of further appeal to the Secretary of the Air Force. However, no appellate authority below The Judge Advocate General may deny an appeal of a claim it had previously denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authority to reduce, withdraw, and restore settlement authority. Any superior settlement authority may reduce, withdraw, or restore delegated authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Settlement negotiations.
