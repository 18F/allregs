                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Varicella-zoster virus serological reagents are  devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests  to identify antibodies to varicella-zoster in serum. The identification  aids in the diagnosis of diseases caused by varicella-zoster viruses and  provides epidemiological information on these diseases. Varicella  (chicken pox) is a mild, highly infectious disease, chiefly of children.  Zoster (shingles) is the recurrent form of the disease, occurring in  adults who were previously infected with varicella-zoster viruses.  Zoster is the response (characterized by a rash) of the partially immune  host to a reactivation of varicella viruses present in latent form in  the patient's body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
