Where the individual requests  that copies of the record be mailed to or her or requests copies of a  record upon reviewing it at the ASC, the individual shall pay the cost  of making requested copies, as set forth in Sec. 1102.109 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In granting access to an individual to a record pertaining to  him or her, the ASC staff shall take steps to prevent the unauthorized  disclosure of information pertaining to other individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Denial of request for access. If it is determined that access  will not be granted, the individual making the request will be notified  of that fact and given the reasons why access is being denied. The  individual also will be advised of his or her right to seek review by  the Executive Director of the initial decision to deny access, in  accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 1102.107 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for acting on requests for access. Access to a record  pertaining to an individual normally will be granted or denied within 30  days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) after the  receipt of the request for access, unless the individual making the  request is notified in writing within the 30 day period that, for good   cause shown, a longer time is required.
