                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The initial scope of the DEIS is determined by the proponent during and after the public interaction phase of the process. Detailed analysis should focus on significant issues (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(2)). To determine the appropriate scope, the proponent must consider three categories of actions, alternatives, and impacts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The three categories of actions (other than unconnected single actions) are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Connected actions are those that are closely related and should be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions that may require EISs, cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are previously or simultaneously taken, are interdependent parts of a larger action, and depend on the larger action for their justification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cumulative actions are those that, when viewed with other past and proposed actions, have cumulatively significant impacts and should be discussed in the same impact statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Similar actions are those that have similarities which provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common timing or geography, and may be analyzed in the EIS. Agencies should do so when the best way to assess such actions is to treat them in a single EIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The three categories of alternatives are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other reasonable courses of action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The three categories of impacts are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Cumulative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proponent can also identify any public EAs and EISs, prepared by the Army or another federal agency, related to, but not part of, the EIS under consideration (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)). Assignments for the preparation of the EIS among the lead and any cooperating agencies can be identified, with the lead agency retaining responsibility for the statement (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(4)); along with the identification of any other environmental review and consultation requirements so the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare other required analyses and studies concurrently with the EIS (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(6)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The identification and elimination of issues that are insignificant, non-controversial, or covered by prior environmental review can narrow the analysis to remaining issues and their significance through reference to their coverage elsewhere (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As part of the scoping process, the lead agency may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set time limits, as provided in Sec. 651.14(b), if they were not already indicated in the preliminary phase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prescribe overall page limits for the EIS in accordance with the CEQ regulations that emphasize conciseness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All determinations reached by the proponent during the scoping process will be clearly conveyed to the preparers of the EIS in a Scope of Statement. The Scope of Statement will be made available to participants in the scoping process and to other interested parties upon request. Any scientific or technical conflicts that arise between the proponent and scoping participants, cooperating agencies, other federal agencies, or preparers will be identified during the scoping process and resolved or discussed by the proponent in the DEIS.</p>
