                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manner of making election. The election to deduct expenditures for land clearing provided by section 182(a) shall be made by means of a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which such election is to apply. The statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year for which the election is to apply. The statement shall also set forth the amount and description of the expenditures for land clearing claimed as a deduction under section 182, and shall include a computation of ``taxable income derived from farming'', if the amount of such income is not the same as the net income from farming shown on Schedule F of Form 1040, increased by the amount of the deduction claimed under section 182.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of election. An election under section 182(a) shall apply only to the taxable year for which made. However, once made, an election applies to all expenditures described in Sec. 1.182-3 paid or incurred during the taxable year, and is binding for such taxable year unless the district director consents to a revocation of such election. Requests for consent to revoke an election under section 182 shall be made by means of a letter to the district director for the district in which the taxpayer is required to file his return, setting forth the taxpayer's name, address and identification number, the year for which it is desired to revoke the election, and the reasons therefor. However, consent will not be granted where the only reason therefor is a change in tax consequences.
