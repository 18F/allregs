                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Maintaining rules. An HMO or CMP must maintain written rules  that deal with, but need not be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All benefits provided under the contract, as described in  Sec. 417.440.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> How and where to obtain services from or through the HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The restrictions on coverage for services furnished from sources  outside a risk HMO or CMP, other than emergency services and urgently  needed services (as defined in Sec. 417.401).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The obligation of the HMO or CMP to assume financial  responsibility and provide reasonable reimbursement for emergency  services and urgently needed services as required by Sec. 417.414(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any services other than the emergency or urgently needed  services that the HMO or CMP chooses to provide as permitted by this  part, from sources outside the HMO or CMP. A cost HMO or CMP must  disclose that the enrollee may receive services through any Medicare  providers and suppliers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Premium information, including the amount (or if the amount  cannot be included, the telephone number of the source from which this  information may be obtained) and the procedures for paying premiums and  other charges for which enrollees may be liable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Grievance and appeal procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Disenrollment rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The obligation of an enrollee who is leaving the HMO's or CMP's  geographic area for more than 90 days to notify the HMO or CMP of the  move or extended absence and the HMO's or CMP's policies concerning  retention of enrollees who leave the geographic area for more than 90  days, as described in Sec. 417.460(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The expiration date of the Medicare contract with CMS and  notice that both CMS and the HMO or CMP are authorized by law to  terminate or refuse to renew the contract, and that termination or  nonrenewal of the contract may result in termination of the individual's  enrollment in the HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Advance directives as specified in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Any other matters that CMS may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Availability of rules. The HMO or CMP must furnish a copy of the  rules to each Medicare enrollee at the time of enrollment and at least  annually thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes in rules. If an HMO or CMP changes its rules, it must  submit the changes to CMS in accordance with Sec. 417.428(a)(3), and  notify its Medicare enrollees of the changes at least 30 days before the  effective date of the changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Advance directives. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An HMO or CMP must maintain written  policies and procedures concerning advance directives, as defined in  Sec. 489.100 of this chapter, with respect to all adult individuals  receiving medical care by or through the HMO or CMP and are required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide written information to those individuals concerning--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Their rights under the law of the State in which the  organization furnishes services (whether statutory or recognized by the  courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care,  including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment  and the right to formulate, at the individual's option, advance  directives. Providers are permitted to contract with other entities to  furnish this information but are still legally responsible for ensuring  that the requirements of this section are met. Such information must  reflect changes in State law as soon as possible, but no later than 90  days after the effective date of the State law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The HMO's or CMP's written policies respecting the  implementation of those rights, including a clear and precise statement  of limitation if the HMO or CMP cannot implement an advance directive as  a matter of conscience. At a minimum, this statement should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Clarify any differences between institution-wide conscience  objections and those that may be raised by individual physicians;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify the state legal authority permitting such objection;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected  by the conscience objection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) of  this section to   each enrollee at the time of initial enrollment. If an enrollee is  incapacitated at the time of initial enrollment and is unable to receive  information (due to the incapacitating condition or a mental disorder)  or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance  directive, the HMO or CMP may give advance directive information to the  enrollee's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other  materials about policies and procedures to the family of the  incapacitated enrollee or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in  accordance with State law. The HMO or CMP is not relieved of its  obligation to provide this information to the enrollee once he or she is  no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. Follow-up  procedures must be in place to ensure that the information is given to  the individual directly at the appropriate time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Document in the individual's medical record whether or not the  individual has executed an advance directive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate  against an individual based on whether or not the individual has  executed an advance directive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether  statutory or recognized by the courts of the State) regarding advance  directives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Provide for education of staff concerning its policies and  procedures on advance directives; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Provide for community education regarding advance directives  that may include material required in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this  section, either directly or in concert with other providers or entities.  Separate community education materials may be developed and used, at the  discretion of the HMO or CMP. The same written materials are not  required for all settings, but the material should define what  constitutes an advance directive, emphasizing that an advance directive  is designed to enhance an incapacitated individual's control over  medical treatment, and describe applicable State law concerning advance  directives. An HMO or CMP must be able to document its community  education efforts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The HMO or CMP--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is not required to provide care that  conflicts with an advance directive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is not required to implement an advance directive if, as a  matter of conscience, the HMO or CMP cannot implement an advance  directive and State law allows any health care provider or any agent of  such provider to conscientiously object.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The HMO or CMP must inform individuals that complaints  concerning non-compliance with the advance directive requirements may be  filed with the State survey and certification agency.
