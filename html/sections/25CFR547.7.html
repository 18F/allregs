                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Printed circuit boards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Printed circuit boards that have the  potential to affect the outcome or integrity of the game, and are  specially manufactured or proprietary and not off-the-   shelf, must display a unique identifier such as a part number and/or  revision number, which must be updated to reflect new revisions or  modifications of the board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Switches or jumpers on all circuit boards that have the  potential to affect the outcome or integrity of any game, progressive  award, financial instrument, cashless transaction, voucher transaction,  or accounting records must be capable of being sealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electrostatic discharge. Class II gaming system components  accessible to the public must be constructed so that they exhibit  immunity to human body electrostatic discharges on areas exposed to  contact. Static discharges of 15 kV for air  discharges and 7.5 kV for contact discharges must  not cause damage or inhibit operation or integrity of the Class II  gaming system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Physical enclosures. Physical enclosures must be of a robust  construction designed to resist determined illegal entry. All  protuberances and attachments such as buttons, identification plates,  and labels must be sufficiently robust to avoid unauthorized removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Player interface. The player interface must exhibit a serial  number and date of manufacture and include a method or means to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Display information to a player; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allow the player to interact with the Class II gaming system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Account access components. A Class II gaming system component  that reads account access media must be located within a secure and  locked area, cabinet, or housing that is of a robust construction  designed to resist determined illegal entry and to protect internal  components. In addition, the account access component:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be constructed so that physical tampering leaves evidence  of such tampering; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must provide a method to enable the Class II gaming system to  interpret and act upon valid or invalid input or error condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Financial instrument storage components. Any financial  instrument storage components managed by Class II gaming system software  must be located within a secure and locked area, cabinet, or housing  that is of a robust construction designed to resist determined illegal  entry and to protect internal components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Financial instrument acceptors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Class II gaming system  components that handle financial instruments and that are not operated  under the direct control of an agent must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be located within a secure and locked area, cabinet, or housing  that is of a robust construction designed to resist determined illegal  entry and to protect internal components;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be able to detect the entry of valid or invalid financial  instruments and to provide a method to enable the Class II gaming system  to interpret and act upon valid or invalid input or error condition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be constructed to permit communication with the Class II  gaming system of the accounting information required by Sec. 547.9(a)  and by applicable provisions of any Commission and TGRA regulations  governing minimum internal control standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to completion of a valid financial instrument transaction  by the Class II gaming system, no monetary amount related to that  instrument may be available for play. For example, credits may not be  available for play until a financial instrument inserted into an  acceptor is secured in the storage component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The monetary amount related to all valid financial instrument  transactions by the Class II gaming system must be recorded as required  by Sec. 547.9(a) and the applicable provisions of any Commission and  TGRA regulations governing minimum internal control standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Financial instrument dispensers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Class II gaming system  components that dispense financial instruments and that are not operated  under the direct control of a tribal gaming operation agent must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be located within a secure, locked and tamper-evident area or in  a locked cabinet or housing that is of a robust construction designed to  resist determined illegal entry and to protect internal components;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide a method to enable the Class II gaming system to  interpret   and act upon valid or invalid input or error condition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be constructed to permit communication with the Class II  gaming system of the accounting information required by Sec. 547.9(a)  and by applicable provisions of any Commission and TGRA regulations  governing minimum internal control standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monetary amount related to all valid financial instrument  transactions by the Class II gaming system must be recorded as required  by Sec. 547.9(a), the applicable provisions of part 543 of this  chapter, and any TGRA regulations governing minimum internal control  standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Game Outcome Determination Components. Any Class II gaming  system logic components that affect the game outcome and that are not  operated under the direct control of a tribal gaming operation agent  must be located within a secure, locked and tamper-evident area or in a  locked cabinet or housing that is of a robust construction designed to  resist determined illegal entry and to protect internal components. DIP  switches or jumpers that can affect the integrity of the Class II gaming  system must be capable of being sealed by the TGRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Door access detection. All components of the Class II gaming  system that are locked in order to meet the requirements of this part  must include a sensor or other methods to monitor an open door. A door  open sensor, and its components or cables, must be secure against  attempts to disable them or interfere with their normal mode of  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Separation of functions/no limitations on technology. Nothing  herein prohibits the account access component, financial instrument  storage component, financial instrument acceptor, and financial  instrument dispenser from being included within the same component or  being separated into individual components.</p>
