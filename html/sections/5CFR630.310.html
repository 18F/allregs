                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Year 2000 computer conversion efforts are deemed to be an  exigency of the public business for the purpose of restoring annual  leave forfeited under 5 U.S.C. 6304. This exigency terminates on January  31, 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For any employee who forfeits annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304  at the beginning of leave year 2000 because the agency determined the  employee's services were required during the Year 2000 computer  conversion exigency, the forfeited annual leave is deemed to have been  scheduled in advance for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) and Sec.  630.308.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) because of the Year  2000 computer conversion exigency must be scheduled and used not later  than the end of leave year 2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The time limits established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of  Sec. 630.306 for using previously restored annual leave do not apply  for the period during which an employee's services were determined  necessary for the completion of Year 2000 computer conversion efforts.  On January 31, 2000, a new time limit will be established under  paragraph (c) of this section for all annual leave restored to such an  employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An employee whose services were determined necessary during the  Year 2000 computer conversion exigency for a portion of leave year 1999,  but who subsequently moves to a position not involving Year 2000  computer conversion efforts, must make a reasonable effort to comply  with the scheduling requirement in Sec. 630.308(a). The head of the  agency or his or her designee may exempt such an employee from the  advance scheduling requirement in Sec. 630.308(a) if coverage under  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section terminated during leave year 1999  and the employee can demonstrate that he or she was unable to comply  with the advance scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his  or her control.
