A control group is an entity, or a group of  individuals or entities, that possesses de jure control and de facto  control of an applicant or licensee, and as to which the applicant's or  licensee's charters, bylaws, agreements and any other relevant documents  (and amendments thereto) provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the entity and/or its members own unconditionally at least  50.1 percent of the total voting interests of a corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the entity and/or its members receive at least 50.1 percent  of the annual distribution or any dividends paid on the voting stock of  a corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That, in the event of dissolution or liquidation of a  corporation, the entity and/or its members are entitled to receive 100  percent of the value of each share of stock in its possession and a  percentage of the retained earnings of the concern that is equivalent to  the amount of equity held in the corporation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That, for other types of businesses, the entity and/or its  members have the right to receive dividends, profits and regular and  liquidating distributions from the business in proportion to the amount  of equity held in the business.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (e): Voting control does not always assure de  facto control, such as for example, when the voting stock of the control  group is widely dispersed (see e.g., Sec. 1.2110(c)(5)(ii)(C) of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Publicly Traded Corporation with Widely Dispersed Voting Power.

The burden is on  the applicant (or licensee) to demonstrate that changes that exceed five  percent are not significant.
