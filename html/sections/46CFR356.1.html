This part also addresses ancillary matters of charters, management agreements, exclusive sales or marketing contracts, conflicts with international agreements, determinations regarding violations of harvesting or processing limits, and exceptions for certain vessels, vessel owners and Mortgagees from the general requirements of the rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) and assigned OMB control number 2133-0530 to the information collection requirements of this part 356.</p>
