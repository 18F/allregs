                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing will be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written Statement or deposition. Any such written Statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner that allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written Statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts will be exchanged as provided in Sec. 13.22(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ALJ will exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Avoid needless consumption of time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ALJ will permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination will be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse

party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon motion of any party, the ALJ will order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party who is an Individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a party that is not an Individual, an officer or employee of the party;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Appearing for the entity pro se; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designated by the party's Representative; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An Individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an Individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the Representative for the Government.</p>
