The denaturing agent must be mixed intimately with all the material to be denatured, and must be applied in such quantity and manner that it cannot easily and readily be removed by washing or soaking. A sufficient amount of the appropriate agent shall be used to give the material a distinctive color, odor, or taste so that such material cannot be confused with an article of human food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inedible rendered animal fats shall be denatured by thoroughly mixing therein denaturing oil, No. 2 fuel oil, brucine dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and pine oil or oil of rosemary, finely powdered charcoal, or any proprietary denaturing agent approved for the purpose by the Administrator in specific cases.

Sufficient of the chosen identifying agents shall be used to give the rendered fat so distinctive a color, odor, or taste that it

cannot be confused with an article of human food.
