A successful challenge that is based on your draft cohort default rate does not excuse you from any other loss of eligibility or placement on provisional certification. However, if your successful challenge under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(1)(iii) of this section is based on a prior, official cohort default rate, and not on your draft cohort default rate, we also excuse you from any subsequent loss of eligibility, under Sec.  668.206(a)(2) or placement on provisional certification, under

Sec.  668.16(m)(2)(i), that would be based on that official cohort default rate.
