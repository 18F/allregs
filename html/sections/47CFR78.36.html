                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coordination of all frequency assignments for fixed stations in  all bands above 2110 MHz, and for mobile (temporary fixed) stations in  the bands 6425-6525 MHz and 17.7-19.7 GHz, will be in accordance with  the procedure established in paragraph (b) of this section, except that  the prior coordination process for mobile (temporary fixed) assignments  may be completed orally   and the period allowed for response to a coordination notification may  be less than 30 days if the parties agree. Coordination of all frequency  assignments for all mobile (temporary fixed) stations in all bands above  2110 MHz, except the bands 6425-6525 MHz and 17.7-19.7 GHz, will be  conducted in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph (b)  of this section or with the procedure in paragraph (d) of this section.  Coordination of all frequency assignments for all fixed stations in the  band 1990-2110 MHz will be in accordance with the procedure established  in paragraph (c) of this section. Coordination of all frequency  assignments for all mobile (temporary fixed) stations in the band 1990- 2110 MHz will be conducted in accordance with the procedure in paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, and (c) and the following  frequency usage coordination procedures will apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. Proposed frequency usage must be prior  coordinated with existing licensees, permittees, and applicants in the  area, and other applicants with previously filed applications, whose  facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in terms of  frequency interference on active channels, applied-for channels, or  channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must be completed  prior to filing an application for regular authorization, or a major  amendment to a pending application, or any major modification to a  license. In coordinating frequency usage with stations in the fixed  satellite service, applicants must also comply with the requirements of  47 CFR 101.21(f). In engineering a system or modification thereto, the  applicant must, by appropriate studies and analyses, select sites,  transmitters, antennas and frequencies that will avoid interference in  excess of permissible levels to other users. All applicants and  licensees must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve  technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and  efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the party being  coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer a  proposal in cases involving conflicts. Applicants should make every  reasonable effort to avoid blocking the growth of systems as prior  coordinated. The applicant must identify in the application all entities  with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that  technical problems are not resolved, an explanation must be submitted  with the application. Where technical problems are resolved by an  agreement or operating arrangement between the parties that would  require special procedures be taken to reduce the likelihood of  interference in excess of permissible levels (such as the use of  artificial site shielding) or would result in a reduction of quality or  capacity of either system, the details thereof may be contained in the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordination procedure guidelines are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coordination involves two separate elements: Notification and  response. Both or either may be oral or in written form. To be  acceptable for filing, all applications and major technical amendments  must certify that coordination, including response, has been completed.  The names of the licensees, permittees and applicants with which  coordination was accomplished must be specified. If such notice and/or  response is oral, the party providing such notice or response must  supply written documentation of the communication upon request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notification must include relevant technical details of the  proposal. At minimum, this should include, as applicable, the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Applicant's name and address,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Transmitting station name,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Transmitting station coordinates,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Transmitting equipment type, its stability, actual output power,  emission designator, and type of modulation (loading),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Transmitting antenna type(s), model, gain and, if required, a  radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Transmitting antenna center line height(s) above ground level  and ground elevation above mean sea level,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Receiving station name,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Receiving station coordinates,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Receiving antenna type(s), model, gain, and, if required, a  radiation pattern provided or certified by the manufacturer,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> Receiving antenna center line height(s) above ground level and  ground elevation above mean sea level,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> Path azimuth and distance,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(M)</em> Estimated transmitter transmission line loss expressed in dB,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(N)</em> Estimated receiver transmission line loss expressed in dB,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(O)</em> For a system utilizing ATPC, maximum transmit power, coordinated  transmit power, and nominal transmit power.</p><p class="depth5">Note to paragraph (b)(2)(ii): The position location of antenna sites  shall be determined to an accuracy of no less than 1 second in the horizontal dimensions (latitude and  longitude) and 1 meter in the vertical dimension  (ground elevation) with respect to the National Spacial Reference  System.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For transmitters employing digital modulation techniques, the  notification should clearly identify the type of modulation. Upon  request, additional details of the operating characteristics of the  equipment must also be furnished;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Response to notification should be made as quickly as possible,  even if no technical problems are anticipated. Any response to  notification indicating potential interference must specify the  technical details and must be provided to the applicant, in writing,  within the 30-day notification period. Every reasonable effort should be  made by all applicants, permittees and licensees to eliminate all  problems and conflicts. If no response to notification is received  within 30 days, the applicant will be deemed to have made reasonable  efforts to coordinate and may file its application without a response;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The 30-day notification period is calculated from the date of  receipt by the applicant, permittee, or licensee being notified. If  notification is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The return receipt on certified mail;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the  recipient; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A conservative estimate of the time required for the mail to  reach its destination. In the last case, the estimated date when the 30- day period would expire should be stated in the notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An expedited prior coordination period (less than 30 days) may  be requested when deemed necessary by a notifying party. The  coordination notice should be identified as ``expedited'' and the  requested response date should be clearly indicated. However,  circumstances preventing a timely response from the receiving party  should be accommodated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the  notifying party to receive written concurrence (or verbal, with written  to follow) from affected parties or their coordination representatives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> All technical problems that come to light during coordination  must be resolved unless a statement is included with the application to  the effect that the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the  conflict and briefly the reason therefore;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where a number of technical changes become necessary for a  system during the course of coordination, an attempt should be made to  minimize the number of separate notifications for these changes. Where  the changes are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items  that were changed from the previous notice should be identified. When  changes are not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed  notification should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. When  the notifying party believes a shorter response time is reasonable and  appropriate, it may be helpful for that party to so indicate in the  notice and perhaps suggest a response date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> If, after coordination is successfully completed, it is  determined that a subsequent change could have no impact on some parties  receiving the original notification, these parties must be notified of  the change and of the coordinator's opinion that no response is  required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Applicants, permittees and licensees should supply to all other  applicants, permittees and licensees within   their areas of operations, the name, address and telephone number of  their coordination representatives. Upon request from coordinating  applicants, permittees and licensees, data and information concerning  existing or proposed facilities and future growth plans in the area of  interest should be furnished unless such request is unreasonable or  would impose a significant burden in compilation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Parties should keep other parties with whom they are  coordinating advised of changes in plans for facilities previously  coordinated. If applications have not been filed 6 months after  coordination was initiated, parties may assume that such frequency use  is no longer desired unless a second notification has been received  within 10 days of the end of the 6 month period. Renewal notifications  are to be sent to all originally notified parties, even if coordination  has not been successfully completed with those parties; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Any frequency reserved by a licensee for future use in the  bands subject to this part must be released for use by another licensee,  permittee, or applicant upon a showing by the latter that it requires an  additional frequency and cannot coordinate one that is not reserved for  future use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each frequency coordinated under this part, the following  frequency usage coordination procedures will apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. Applicants are responsible for selecting  the frequency assignments that are least likely to result in mutual  interference with other licensees in the same area. Applicants may  consult local frequency coordination committees, where they exist, for  information on frequencies available in the area. Proposed frequency  usage must be coordinated with existing licensees and applicants in the  area whose facilities could affect or be affected by the new proposal in  terms of frequency interference on active channels, applied-for  channels, or channels coordinated for future growth. Coordination must  be completed prior to filing an application for regular authorization,  for major amendment to a pending application, or for major modification  to a license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To be acceptable for filing, all applications for regular  authorization, or major amendment to a pending application, or major  modification to a license, must include a certification attesting that  all co-channel and adjacent-channel licensees and applicants potentially  affected by the proposed fixed use of the frequency(ies) have been  notified and are in agreement that the proposed facilities can be  installed without causing harmful interference to those other licensees  and applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each frequency coordinated under this part, applicants are  responsible for selecting the frequency assignments that are least  likely to result in mutual interference with other licensees in the same  area. Applicants may consult local frequency coordination committees,  where they exist, for information on frequencies available in the area.  In selecting frequencies, consideration should be given to the relative  location of receive points, normal transmission paths, and the nature of  the contemplated operation.
