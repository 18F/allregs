The relative financial interests of the affected individual and other participants will be determined with reference to the most recent fishing year for which information is available. However, for fisheries in which IFQs are assigned, the percentage of IFQs assigned to the affected individual will be the determining factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Expected and substantially disproportionate benefit'' means a quantifiable positive or negative impact with regard to a matter likely to affect a fishery or sector of the fishery in which the affected individual has a significant interest, as indicated by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A greater than 10-percent interest in the total harvest of the fishery or sector of the fishery in question;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A greater than 10-percent interest in the marketing or processing of the total harvest of the fishery or sector of the fishery in question; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Full or partial ownership of more than 10 percent of the vessels using the same gear type within the fishery or sector of the fishery in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A member of an SSC is not subject to the restrictions on voting under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Voluntary recusal. An affected individual who believes that a Council decision would have a significant and predictable effect on that individual's financial interest disclosed under paragraph (b) of this section may, at any time before a vote is taken, announce to the Council an intent not to vote on the decision and identify the financial interest that would be affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Participation in deliberations. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, an affected individual who is recused from voting under this section may participate in Council and committee deliberations relating to the decision, after notifying the Council of the voting recusal and identifying the financial interest that would be affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Requests for determination. (1) At the request of an affected individual, the designated official shall determine for the record whether a Council decision would have a significant and predictable effect on that individual's financial interest. The determination will be based upon a review of the information contained in the individual's financial disclosure form and any other reliable and probative information provided in writing. All information considered will be made part of the public record for the decision. The affected individual may request a determination by notifying the designated official--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the request of an affected individual, the designated official shall determine for the record whether a Council decision would have a significant and predictable effect on that individual's financial interest. The determination will be based upon a review of the information contained in the individual's financial disclosure form and any other reliable and probative information provided in writing. All information considered will be made part of the public record for the decision. The affected individual may request a determination by notifying the designated official--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within a reasonable time before the Council meeting at which the Council decision will be made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During a Council meeting before a Council vote on the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designated official may initiate a determination on the basis of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> His or her knowledge of the fishery and the financial interests disclosed by an affected individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Written and signed information received within a reasonable time before a Council meeting or, if the issue could not have been anticipated before the meeting, during a Council meeting before a Council vote on the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At the beginning of each Council meeting, or during a Council meeting at any time reliable and probative information is received, the designated official shall announce the receipt of information relevant to a determination concerning recusal, the nature of that information, and the identity of the submitter of such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the designated official determines that the affected individual may not vote, the individual may state for the record how he or she would have voted. A Council Chair may not allow such an individual to cast a vote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A reversal of a determination under paragraph (g) of this section may not be treated as cause for invalidation or reconsideration by the Secretary of a Council's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Review of determinations. (1) Any Council member may file a written request to the NOAA General Counsel for review of the designated official's determination. A request for review must be received within 10 days of the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any Council member may file a written request to the NOAA General Counsel for review of the designated official's determination. A request for review must be received within 10 days of the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A request must include a full statement in support of the review, including a concise statement as to why the Council's decision did or did not have a significantly disproportionate benefit to the financial interest of the affected individual relative to the financial interests of other participants in the same gear type or sector of the fishery, and why the designated official's determination should be reversed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the request for review is from a Council member other than the affected individual whose vote is at issue, the requester must provide a copy of the request to the affected individual at the same time it is submitted to the NOAA General Counsel. The affected individual may submit a response to the NOAA General Counsel within 10 days from the date of his/her receipt of the request for review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The NOAA General Counsel must complete the review and issue a decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for review. The NOAA General Counsel will limit the review to the record before the designated official at the time of the determination, the request, and any response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 regarding conflicts of interest do not apply to an affected individual who is a voting member of a Council appointed

by the Secretary, as described under section 302(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and who is in compliance with the requirements of this section for filing a financial disclosure report. The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 do not apply to a member of an SSC, unless that individual is an officer or employee of the United States or is otherwise covered by the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 208.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is unlawful for an affected individual to knowingly and willfully fail to disclose, or to falsely disclose, any financial interest as required by this section, or to knowingly vote on a Council decision in violation of this section. In addition to the penalties applicable under Sec. 600.735, a violation of this provision may result in removal of the affected individual from Council or SSC membership.
