                                Sec. 1.563-2  Personal holding company tax.

                            <p class="depth0">In the case of a personal holding company subject to the provisions of section 541, dividends paid after the close of the taxable year and before the 15th day of the third month thereafter shall be included in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year only if the taxpayer so elects in its return for such taxable year. The election shall be made by including such dividends in computing its dividends paid deduction. The amount of such dividends which may be included in computing the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year shall not exceed either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The undistributed personal holding company income of the corporation for the taxable year, computed without regard to this section, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, 20 percent (10 percent, in the case of a taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 1970) of the sum of the dividends paid during the taxable year (not including consent dividends), computed without regard to this section

In computing the amount of the dividends paid deduction allowable for any taxable year, the amount allowed by reason of section 563(b) for any preceding taxable year is considered a dividend paid in such preceding taxable year and not in the year of actual distribution. Thus, a double deduction is not allowable.
