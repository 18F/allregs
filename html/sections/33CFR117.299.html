After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks, providing the scanning equipment reveals nothing under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach track circuit is occupied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After the train has cleared, the draw opens and the lights return to flashing green.
