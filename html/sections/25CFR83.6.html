                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The documented petition may be in any readable form that  contains detailed, specific evidence in support of a request to the  Secretary to acknowledge tribal existence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The documented petition must include a certification, signed and  dated by members of the group's governing body, stating that it is the  group's official documented petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A petitioner must satisfy all of the criteria in paragraphs (a)  through (g) of Sec. 83.7 in order for tribal existence to be  acknowledged. Therefore, the documented petition must include thorough  explanations and supporting documentation in response to all of the  criteria. The definitions in Sec. 83.1 are an integral part of the  regulations, and the criteria should be read carefully together with  these definitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A petitioner may be denied acknowledgment if the evidence  available demonstrates that it does not meet one or more criteria. A  petitioner may also   be denied if there is insufficient evidence that it meets one or more of  the criteria. A criterion shall be considered met if the available  evidence establishes a reasonable likelihood of the validity of the  facts relating to that criterion. Conclusive proof of the facts relating  to a criterion shall not be required in order for the criterion to be  considered met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evaluation of petitions shall take into account historical  situations and time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited  or not available. The limitations inherent in demonstrating the  historical existence of community and political influence or authority  shall also be taken into account. Existence of community and political  influence or authority shall be demonstrated on a substantially  continuous basis, but this demonstration does not require meeting these  criteria at every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during  various years shall not in themselves be a cause for denial of  acknowledgment under these criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (g) shall be interpreted  as applying to tribes or groups that have historically combined and  functioned as a single autonomous political entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The specific forms of evidence stated in the criteria in Sec.  83.7 (a) through (c) and Sec. 83.7(e) are not mandatory requirements.  The criteria may be met alternatively by any suitable evidence that  demonstrates that the petitioner meets the requirements of the criterion  statement and related definitions.</p>
