A presumption exists that a separate entity, a subsidiary, or a division is a business. However, a lesser component of an entity may also constitute a business. Among the facts and circumstances which should be considered in evaluating whether an acquisition of a lesser component of an entity constitutes a business are the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity of the component will remain generally the same as before the transaction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether any of the following attributes remain with the component after the transaction:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Physical facilities,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employee base,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Market distribution system,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sales force,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Customer base,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Operating rights,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Production techniques, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Trade names.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This rule does not apply to transactions between a parent company and its totally held subsidiary.
