Any time  two consecutive one-hour average measured concentration of Hg exceeds  the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a  higher, ``above span'' Hg reference gas standard to the Hg CEMS. The  ``above span'' reference gas must meet the requirements of PS 12A,  Section 7.1, must be of a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent  of the highest hourly concentration measured during the period of  measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. Record and  report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily  calibration. The ``above span'' calibration is successful if the value  measured by the Hg CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of  the reference gas. If the value measured by the Hg CEMS exceeds 20  percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must  normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span  during the 24-hour period preceding or following the ``above span''  calibration for reporting based on the Hg CEMS response to the reference  gas as shown in equation 19: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12FE13.024  Only one `above span' calibration is needed per 24 hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For stack Hg concentrations 1 [micro]g/dscm, <=10% of  section 1 mass;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For stack Hg concentrations <=1 [micro]g/dscm and  0.5 [micro]g/dscm, <=20% of section 1 mass;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For stack Hg concentrations <=0.5 [micro]g/dscm and  0.1 [micro]g/dscm, <=50% of section 1 mass; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For stack Hg concentrations <=0.1 [micro]g/dscm, no  breakthrough criterion assuming all other QA/QC specifications are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relative accuracy testing of mercury monitoring systems under PS  12A, PS 12B, or Procedure 5 must be conducted at normal operating  conditions. If a facility has an inline raw mill, the testing must occur  with the raw mill on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Develop a mercury hourly mass emissions rate by conducting  annual performance tests using Method 29, or Method 30B, to measure the  concentration of mercury in the gases exhausted from the alkali bypass  and coal mill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On a continuous basis, determine the mass emissions of mercury  in lb/hr from the alkali bypass and coal mill exhausts by using the  mercury hourly emissions rate, the exhaust gas flow rate and hourly  mercury emission rate to calculate hourly mercury emissions in lb/hr.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sum the hourly mercury emissions from the kiln, alkali bypass  and coal mill to determine total mercury emissions. Using hourly clinker  production, calculate the hourly emissions rate in pounds per ton of  clinker to determine your 30 day rolling average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If mercury emissions from the coal mill are below the method  detection limit for two consecutive annual performance tests, you may  reduce the frequency of the performance tests of coal mills to once  every 30 months.

The span value should be a  concentration equivalent to approximately two times the emissions  standard and it may be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 ppm of HCl.  The HCl CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of  expected HCl concentration values which would include those expected  during ``mill off'' conditions. Engineering judgments made and  calculations used to determine the corresponding span concentration from  the emission standard shall be documented in the site-specific  monitoring plan and associated records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include a second span that encompasses the HCl emission  concentrations expected to be encountered during ``mill off''  conditions. This second span may be rounded to a multiple of 5 [micro]g/ m\3\ of total HCl. The requirements of the appropriate HCl monitor  performance specification, shall be followed for this second span with  the exception that a RATA with the mill off is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Quality assure any data above the span value established in  paragraph (1)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Any  time the average measured concentration of HCl exceeds or is expected to  exceed the span value for greater than two hours you must, within a  period 24 hours before or after the `above span` period, introduce a  higher, `above span` HCl reference gas standard to the HCl CEMS. The  `above span` reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable  performance specification and be of a concentration level between 50 and  100 percent of the highest hourly concentration measured during the  period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe.  Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily  calibration. The `above span` calibration is successful if the value  measured by the HCl CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of  the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS is not within  20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must  normalize the stack gas values measured above span as described in  paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(C) below. If the `above span` calibration is  conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and  there is a failure to collect the required minimum number of data points  in an hour due to the calibration duration, then you must determine the  emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages  for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed  hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the event that the `above span` calibration is not successful  (i.e., the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the  certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one- hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour  period preceding or following the `above span` calibration for reporting  based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Equation  20: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12FE13.025     Only one `above span` calibration is needed per 24-hour period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Install, operate, and maintain a CMS to monitor wet scrubber or  tray tower parameters, as specified in paragraphs (m)(5) and (7) of this  section, and dry scrubber, as specified in paragraph (m)(9) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the source is equipped with a wet or dry scrubber or tray  tower, and you choose to monitor SO2 emissions, monitor  SO2 emissions continuously according to the requirements of  Sec.  60.63(e) through (f) of part 60 subpart F of this chapter.
