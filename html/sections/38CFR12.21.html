Such inventories and information together with any bank books, stocks, bonds, or other valuable paper as enumerated in Sec.  12.19(b), left in the effects of the veteran, will be delivered to the manager of the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, center, or domiciliary activity having jurisdiction, for disposition in accordance with existing regulations.
