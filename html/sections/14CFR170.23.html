As defined in Sec. 170.3 of this part, the benefit-cost ratio is the ratio of the present value of the LORAN-C life-cycle benefits (PVB) to the present value of LORAN-C life-cycle costs (PVC):
PVB/PVC =1.0</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The criteria do not cover all situations that may arise and are not used as a sole determinant in denying or granting the establishment of non-precision LORAN-C approach for which there is a demonstrated operational or air traffic control requirement.</p>
