                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action under Sec. 1301.46 to close a meeting shall be taken  only when a majority of the members vote to take such action. A separate  vote shall be taken with respect to each meeting a   portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public  pursuant to Sec. 1301.46 or with respect to any information which is  proposed to be withheld under Sec. 1301.46. A single vote may be taken  with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are  proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information  concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such  series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held  no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote  of each member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no  proxies shall be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding that the members may have already voted not to  close a meeting, whenever any person whose interests may be directly  affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the agency close such  portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraphs  (e), (f), or (g) of Sec. 1301.46, the Board, upon request of any one of  its members made prior to the commencement of such portion, shall vote  by recorded vote whether to close such portion of the meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to this section, TVA  shall make publicly available in accordance with Sec. 1301.48 a written  copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If  a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, TVA shall, within  one day of the vote taken pursuant to this section, make publicly  available in accordance with Sec. 1301.48 a full written explanation of  this action closing the portion together with a list of all persons  expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior to every meeting closed pursuant to Sec. 1301.46, there  shall be a certification by the General Counsel of TVA stating whether,  in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and each  relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification shall be  retained by TVA and shall be made publicly available in accordance with  Sec. 1301.48.
