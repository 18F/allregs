The United States' share will be determined by the authorized officer as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For sales of less than 1 million board feet, costs over $1,000;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For sales of from 1 to 3 million board feet, costs over the sum of $1 per thousand board feet;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For sales of over 3 million board feet, costs over $3,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the authorized officer determines that the damages caused by such major physical change are so great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical under this cost-sharing arrangement, he may cancel the timber sale contract notwithstanding any provisions thereof.</p>
