                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 1366(e), if an individual, who is a  member of the family of one or more shareholders of an S corporation,  renders services for, or furnishes capital to, the corporation without  receiving reasonable compensation, the Commissioner shall prescribe  adjustments to those items taken into account by the individual and the  shareholders as may be necessary to reflect the value of the services  rendered or capital furnished. For these purposes, in determining the  reasonable value for services rendered, or capital furnished, to the  corporation, consideration will be given to all the facts and  circumstances, including the amount that ordinarily would be paid in  order to obtain comparable services or capital from a person (other than  a member of the family) who is not a shareholder in the corporation. In  addition, for purposes of section 1366(e), if a member of the family of  one or more shareholders of the S corporation holds an interest in a  passthrough entity (e.g., a partnership, S corporation, trust, or  estate), that performs services for, or furnishes capital to, the S  corporation without receiving reasonable compensation, the Commissioner  shall prescribe adjustments to the passthrough entity and the  corporation as may be necessary to reflect the value of the services  rendered or capital furnished. For purposes of section 1366(e), the term  family of any shareholder includes only the shareholder's spouse,  ancestors, lineal descendants, and any trust for the primary benefit of  any of these persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The stock of an S corporation is owned 50 percent by F  and 50 percent by T, the minor son of F. For the taxable year, the  corporation has items of taxable income equal to $70,000. Compensation  of $10,000 is paid by the corporation to F for services rendered during  the taxable year, and no compensation is paid to T, who rendered no  services. Based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, reasonable  compensation for the services rendered by F would be $30,000. In the  discretion of the Internal Revenue Service, up to an additional $20,000  of the $70,000 of the corporation's taxable income, for tax purposes,  may be allocated to F as compensation for services rendered. If the  Internal Revenue Service allocates $20,000 of the corporation's taxable  income to F as compensation for services, taxable income of the  corporation would be reduced by $20,000 to $50,000, of which F and T  each would be allocated $25,000. F would have $30,000 of total  compensation paid by the corporation for services rendered.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The stock of an S corporation is owned by A and B. For  the taxable year, the corporation has paid compensation to a partnership  that rendered services to the corporation during the taxable year. The  spouse of A is a partner in that partnership. Consequently, if based on  all the relevant facts and circumstances the partnership did not receive  reasonable compensation for the services rendered to the corporation,  the Internal Revenue Service, in its discretion, may make adjustments to  those items taken into account by the partnership and the corporation as  may be necessary to reflect the value of the services rendered.
