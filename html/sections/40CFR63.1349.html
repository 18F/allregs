As described in Sec.  63.7(c)(2)(i), you must make available to the Administrator prior to testing, if requested, the site-specific test plan to be followed during performance testing. For purposes of determining exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere from an alkali bypass stack or a coal mill stack, you must either install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate according to the requirements in paragraphs Sec.  63.1350(n)(1) through (10) of this subpart or use the maximum design exhaust gas flow rate. For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS on the alkali bypass stack or coal mill stack, you may use the results of the initial and subsequent performance test to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A brief description of the process and the air pollution control system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling location description(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of sampling and analytical procedures and any modifications to standard procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Test results;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Quality assurance procedures and results;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Records of operating conditions during the performance test, preparation of standards, and calibration procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Raw data sheets for field sampling and field and laboratory analyses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Documentation of calculations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All data recorded and used to establish parameters for monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Any other information required by the performance test method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> PM emissions tests.
