                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your testing. The procedures in this part apply for all testing  you do to   show compliance with emission standards, with certain exceptions noted  in this section. In some other sections in this part, we allow you to  use other procedures (such as less precise or less accurate procedures)  if they do not affect your ability to show that your engines comply with  the applicable emission standards. This generally requires emission  levels to be far enough below the applicable emission standards so that  any errors caused by greater imprecision or inaccuracy do not affect  your ability to state unconditionally that the engines meet all  applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Our testing. These procedures generally apply for testing that  we do to determine if your engines comply with applicable emission  standards. We may perform other testing as allowed by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(7)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> allow us to  be responsive to issues as they arise, we would generally work toward  making these testing changes generally applicable through rulemaking. We  will allow reasonable lead time for compliance with any resulting change  in procedures. We will consider the following factors in determining the  importance of pursuing changes to the procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether supplemental emission standards or other requirements in  the standard-setting part address the type of operation of concern or  otherwise prevent inappropriate design strategies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the unrepresentative aspect of the procedures affect  your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the established procedures require the use  of emission-control technologies or strategies that are expected to  ensure a comparable degree of emission control under the in-use  operation that differs from the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may request to use special procedures if your engine cannot  be tested using the specified procedures. For example, this may apply if  your engine cannot operate on the specified duty cycle. In this case,  tell us in writing why you cannot satisfactorily test your engine using  this part's procedures and ask to use a different approach. We will  approve your request if we determine that it would produce emission  measurements that represent in-use operation and we determine that it  can be used to show compliance with the requirements of the standard- setting part. Where we approve special procedures that differ  substantially from the specified procedures, we may preclude you from  participating in   averaging, banking, and trading with the affected engine families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a given model year, you may use procedures required for later  model year engines without request. If you upgrade your testing facility  in stages, you may rely on a combination of procedures for current and  later model year engines as long as you can ensure, using good  engineering judgment, that the combination you use for testing does not  affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In a given model year, you may ask to use procedures allowed for  earlier model year engines. We will approve this only if you show us  that using the procedures allowed for earlier model years does not  affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may ask to use emission data collected using other  procedures, such as those of the California Air Resources Board or the  International Organization for Standardization. We will approve this  only if you show us that using these other procedures does not affect  your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> does  not restrict the use of carryover certification data otherwise allowed  by the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You may request to use alternate procedures that are equivalent  to the specified procedures, or procedures that are more accurate or  more precise than the specified procedures. We may perform tests with  your engines using either the approved alternate procedures or the  specified procedures. The following provisions apply to requests for  alternate procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applications. Follow the instructions in Sec.  1065.12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submission. Submit requests in writing to the Designated  Compliance Officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notification. We may approve your request by telling you  directly, or we may issue guidance announcing our approval of a specific  alternate procedure, which would make additional requests for approval  unnecessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advance approval. If we require you to request approval to use  other procedures under paragraph (c) of this section, you may not use  them until we approve your request.
