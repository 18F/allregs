                            <p class="depth0">There should be joint fares in all markets over all routings within  the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Level. The level shall not exceed the sum of the maximum local  fares permitted by this subpart minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling  terminal charge for each interline connection, and in any event shall  not exceed the sum of the actual local fares.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Division. Joint fares shall be divided according to the relative  costs of the mileage flown by each carrier participating in the  interline movement. However, where a joint fare is equal to the sum of  the actual local fares, each carrier shall get the local fare as its  share.
