                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fees for records available through the Public Reference Room--1)  General rule. The fee for finding and duplicating records available in  the Commission's Public Reference Room will vary depending on the size  and complexity of the request. A person can obtain a copy of the  schedule of fees in person or by mail from the Public Reference Room.  This schedule is also available on the Commission's Web site. Copies of  documents also may be made on self-service duplicating machines located  in the Public Reference Room. In addition, copies of data extracted from  the Commission's files through electronic media are available on a  reimbursable basis, upon written request to the Public Reference Room.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stenographic reports of Commission hearings are made by a  private contractor. Interested persons may obtain copies of public  hearing transcripts from the contractor at prices set in the contract,  or through the search and duplication service noted above. Copies of the  contract are available for public inspection in the Public Reference  Room.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Copies of transcripts, electronic recordings, or minutes of  Commission meetings closed to public observation containing material  nonexempt pursuant to Sec. 375.206(f) of this chapter are also  available at the actual cost of duplication or transcription.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fees for records not available through the Public Reference Room  (FOIA or CEII requests). The cost of duplication of records not  available in the Public Reference Room will depend on the number of  documents requested, the time necessary to locate the documents  requested, and the category of the persons requesting the records. The  procedures for appeal of requests for fee waiver or reduction are set  forth in Sec. 388.110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definitions: For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one  who   seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers commercial trade,  or profit interests as these phrases are commonly known or have been  interpreted by the courts in the context of the Freedom of Information  Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or  private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an  institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational  education, which operates a program of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an installation  that is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely  for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which  are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Representatives of the news media refers to any person actively  gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish  or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is  about current events that would be of current interest to the public.  Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations  broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but  only in those instances when the periodicals can qualify as  disseminations of ``news'') who make their products available for  purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not  intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news  delivery evolve (e.g. electronic dissemination of newspapers through  telecommunication services), such alternative media may be included in  this category. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a  news organization if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for  expecting publication through that organization, even though the  journalist is not actually employed by the news organization. A  publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Commission may  also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fees. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If documents are requested for commercial use, the  Commission will charge the employee's hourly pay rate plus 16% for  benefits for document search time and for document review time, and 15  cents per page for duplication. Commercial use requests are not entitled  to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction of  documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If documents are not sought for commercial use and the request  is made by an educational or non-commercial scientific institution,  whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or a representative  of the news media, the Commission will charge 15 cents per page for  duplication. There is no charge for the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a request not described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of  this section, the Commission will charge the employees hourly pay rate  plus 16 percent for benefits for document search and 15 cents per page  for duplication. There is no charge for the first 100 pages of  reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished  without charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Director, Office of External Affairs, will normally provide  documents by regular mail, with postage prepaid by the Commission.  However, the requester may authorize special delivery, such as express  mail, at the requester's own expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Commission, or its designee, may establish minimum fees  below which no charges will be collected, if it determines that the  costs of routine collection and processing of the fees are likely to  equal or exceed the amount of the fees. If total fees assessed by  Commission staff for a Freedom of Information Act request are less than  the appropriate threshold, the Commission may not charge the requesters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Payment of fees must be by check or money order made payable to  the U.S. Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Requesters may not file multiple requests at the same time,  each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to  avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a  requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to  break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose   of evading assessment of fees, or otherwise reasonably believes that two  or more requests constitute a single request, the Commission may  aggregate any such requests accordingly. The Commission will not  aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from a requester.  Aggregated requests may qualify for an extension of time under Sec.  388.110(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fees for unsuccessful search. The Commission may assess charges  for time spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records, or if  records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If the  Commission estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it  will notify the requester of the estimated amount of search fees, unless  the requester has indicated in advance willingness to pay fees as high  as those anticipated. The requester can meet with Commission personnel  with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at  a lower cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest--notice and rate. The Commission will assess interest  charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on  which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in  31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Advance payments. The Commission will require a requester to  make an advance payment, i.e., payments before work is commenced or  continued on a request, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges  that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. The  Commission will notify the requester of the estimated cost and either  require satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a  history of prompt payment of fees, or require advance payment of charges  if a requester has no history of payment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a  timely fashion. The Commission will require the requester to pay the  full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance  payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Commission  will begin to process a new request or a pending request from that  requester. When the Commission requires advance payment or an agreement  to pay under this paragraph, or under Sec. 388.108(a)(5), the  administrative time limits prescribed in this part will begin only after  the Commission has received the required payments, or agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fee reduction or waiver. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any fee described in this section  may be reduced or waived if the requester demonstrates that disclosure  of the information sought is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the public interest because it is likely to contribute  significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of  the government, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will consider the following criteria to determine  the public interest standard:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the  operations or activities of the government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an  understanding of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether disclosure of the requested information will  contribute to public understanding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to  public understanding of government operations or facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commission will consider the following criteria to determine  the commercial interest of the requester:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be  furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of  the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public  interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> This request for fee reduction or waiver must accompany the  initial request for records and will be decided under the same  procedures used for record requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Debt collection. The Commission will use the authorities  mandated in the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716-3719  (1982), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of  collection agencies,   where appropriate, to encourage payment of outstanding unpaid FOIA  invoices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annual adjustment of fees--1) Update and publication. The  Commission, by its designee, the Executive Director, will update the  fees established in this section each fiscal year. The Executive  Director will publish the fees in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment of updated fees. The fee applicable to a particular  Freedom of Information Act request will be the fee in effect on the date  that the request is received.
