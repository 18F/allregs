                            <p class="depth0">A license issued under section 512(m)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act (the act) will be revoked on the basis of a request for  its revocation submitted in writing by a responsible individual holding  such license on the grounds that the facility no longer manufactures any   animal feed covered under Sec. 558.4(b) of this chapter. A written  request for such revocation shall be construed as a waiver of the  opportunity for a hearing as otherwise provided for in this section.  Revocation of approval of a medicated feed mill license under the  provisions of this paragraph shall be without prejudice.</p>
