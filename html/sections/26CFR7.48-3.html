                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Under section 804(e)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 1596), taxpayers may elect to apply the amendments made by section 804 (a) and (b) of the Act to movie and television films that are property described in section 50(a) of the Code and that were placed in service in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time for and manner of making election--(1) Time for making election. The election under section 804(e)(2) the Act must be made not later than October 4, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Time for making election. The election under section 804(e)(2) the Act must be made not later than October 4, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner of making election. The election under section 804(e)(2) shall be made by applying the same rules applicable under section 804(c)(2) as described in Sec. 7.48-2(b) (2), (3), and (4) except that Sec. 7.48-2(b)(2)(ii) shall be read to require a statement that the taxpayer is making an election under section 804(e)(2) of the Act, and Sec. 7.48-2(b)(2)(vi) shall not apply. An election properly made under section 804(e)(2) of the Act may not be revoked after October 4, 1977.

Sec. 7.57(d)-1  Election with respect to straight line recovery of intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section prescribes rules for making the election permitted under section 57(d)(2), as added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Under this election taxpayers may use cost depletion to compute straight line recovery of intangibles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election. The election under section 57(d) is subject to the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The election is made within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year in which the intangible drilling costs are paid or incurred or, if later, by July 25, 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The election is made separately for each well. Thus, a taxpayer may make the election for only some of his or her wells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The election is made by using, for the well or wells to which the election applies, cost depletion to compute straight line recovery of intangibles for purposes of determining the amount of the preference under section 57(a)(11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The election may be made whether or not the taxpayer uses cost depletion in computing taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The election is made by a partnership rather than by each partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of cost depletion. For purposes of computing straight line recovery of intangibles through cost depletion, both depletable and depreciable intangible drilling and development costs for the taxable year are taken into account. They are treated as if capitalized, added to basis, and recovered under Sec. 1.611-2(a). Costs paid or incurred in other taxable years are not taken into account.
