                            <p class="depth0">Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers may be safely used to produce  packaging materials, containers, and equipment intended for use in  producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating,  packaging, transporting, or holding food, in accordance with the  following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers consist of basic resins  produced   by the catalytic copolymerization of ethylene and ethyl acrylate, to  which may have been added certain optional substances to impart desired  technological properties to the resin. Subject to any limitations  prescribed in this section, the optional substances may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substances generally recognized as safe in food and food  packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substances the use of which is permitted under applicable  regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter, prior sanction, or  approvals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ethyl acrylate content of the copolymer does not exceed 8  percent by weight unless it is blended with polyethylene or with one or  more olefin copolymers complying with Sec. 177.1520 or with a mixture of  polyethylene and one or more olefin copolymers, in such proportions that  the ethyl acrylate content of the blend does not exceed 8 percent by  weight, or unless it is used in a coating complying with Sec. 175.300 or  Sec. 176.170 of this chapter, in such proportions that the ethyl  acrylate content does not exceed 8 percent by weight of the finished  coating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section, when tested by the methods prescribed for  polyethylene in Sec. 177.1520.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specifications--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Infrared identification. Ethylene-ethyl  acrylate copolymers can be identified by their characteristic infrared  spectra.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quantitative determination of ethyl acrylate content. The ethyl  acrylate can be determined by the infrared spectra. Prepare a scan from  10.5 microns to 12.5 microns. Obtain a baseline absorbance at 11.6  microns and divide by the plaque thickness to obtain absorbance per mil.  From a previously prepared calibration curve, obtain the amount of ethyl  acrylate present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specific gravity. Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers have a  specific gravity of not less than 0.920 nor more than 0.935, as  determined by ASTM method D1505-68 (Reapproved 1979), ``Standard Test  Method for Density of Plastics by the Density-Gradient Technique,''  which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the  American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West  Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers or the blend may  be used in contact with food except as a component of articles used for  packaging or holding food during cooking provided they meet the  following extractability limits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maximum soluble fraction of 11.3 percent in xylene after  refluxing and subsequent cooling to 25 C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maximum extractable fraction of 5.5 percent when extracted with  n-hexane at 50 C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c)(2) of this section are  not applicable to ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers used in the  formulation of adhesives complying with Sec. 175.105 of this chapter.
