However,  such exclusions for property damage shall not include corrective action  associated with releases from tanks which are covered by the policy.</p><p class="depth2">Provider of financial assurance means an entity that provides  financial assurance to an owner or operator of an underground storage  tank through one of the mechanisms listed in Sec.

A guarantee contract is issued ``incident to that  relationship'' if it arises from a clear commonality of interest in the  event of an UST release such as coterminous boundaries, overlapping  constituencies, common ground-water aquifer, or other relationship other  than monetary compensation that provides a motivation for the guarantor  to provide a guarantee.</p><p class="depth2">Tangible net worth means the tangible assets that remain after  deducting liabilities; such assets do not include intangibles such as  goodwill and rights to patents or royalties. For purposes of this  definition, ``assets'' means all existing and all probable future  economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a  result of past transactions.</p><p class="depth2">Termination under Sec.  280.97(b)(1) and Sec.  280.97(b)(2) means  only those changes that could result in a gap in coverage as where the  insured has not obtained substitute coverage or has obtained substitute  coverage with a different retroactive date than the retroactive date of  the original policy.
