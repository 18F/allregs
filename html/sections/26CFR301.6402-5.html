                                Sec. 301.6402-5  Offset of past-due support against overpayment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scope. Section 6402(c) requires the Secretary  of the Treasury or his delegate to reduce the amount of any overpayment  to be refunded to a person making an overpayment by the amount of past- due support owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified  in accordance with section 464 of the Social Security Act. Past-due  support shall be collected by offset under section 6402(c) and this  section in the same manner as if it were a liability for tax imposed by  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (except that a liability for tax shall  be given priority with respect to offset arising under section 6402(a)).  Collection by offset under section 6402(c) of this section is a  collection procedure separate from the collection procedures provided by  section 6305 and Sec. 301.6305-1, relating to assessment and collection  of certain child and spousal support liabilities. The sole collection  procedure provided by section 6402(c) and this section is that of offset  against overpayment. Section 6305 and Sec. 301.6305-1, by contrast,  provide for other collection procedures in addition to collection by  offset against overpayment. Sections 6305 and 6402(c) have differing  procedural requirements and may be used separately or in conjunction  with each other.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General rule. An amount of past-due support qualifies for offset  under this section if it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of  this section. A State shall submit to the Department of Health and Human  Services a notification of liability for qualifying past-due support  containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section. A  qualifying amount of past-due support owed by a taxpayer who has made an  overpayment shall be collected in accordance with the procedures set  forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Under paragraph (d), the balance  of any overpayment remaining after crediting of the overpayment under  section 6402(a) to any liability for an internal revenue tax on the part  of the taxpayer shall be offset by the amount of past-due support of  which the Internal Revenue Service has been notified. The amount of the  overpayment not subject to offset for any liability for an internal  revenue tax or for past-due support shall be promptly refunded to the  taxpayer. Paragraph (e) of this section requires that the Internal  Revenue Service notify the taxpayer of the amount of the offset and of  the State to which it has been paid. Under procedures set forth in  paragraph (f) of this section, amounts collected by offset shall be  transferred to a special account maintained by the Bureau of Government  Financial Operations for distribution to the States. The Internal  Revenue Service shall make monthly collection reports to the Secretary  of Health and Human Services or his delegate. The States shall reimburse  the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of the refund offset  under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Past-due support--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section,  the term ``past-due support'' means the amount of a delinquent  obligation, which amount was determined under a court order, or an order  pursuant to an administrative process established under State law, for  support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with  whom the child is living.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Past-due support qualifying for offset. Past-due support  qualifies for offset under section 6402(c) and this section if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There has been as assignment of the support obligation to a  State pursuant to section 402(a)(26) of the Social Security Act  (relating to aid and service to needy families with children) and that  State has made reasonable efforts to collect the amount of the  obligation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of past-due support is not less than $150.00;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The past-due support has been delinquent for three months or  longer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A notification of liability for past-due support has been  received by the Secretary of the Treasury as prescribed by paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of liability for past-due support--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form. A  State shall, by October 1 of each year, submit a notification (or  notifications) of liability for past-due support on magnetic tape to the  Special Collection Activities Unit.  Office of Child Support Enforcement, Department of Health and Human  Services, 6110 Executive Boulevard, Suite 900, Rockville, Maryland  20852, Attention: Tax Refund Offset--Tape Processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content. The notification of liability for past-due support  shall contain with respect to each taxpayer--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the taxpayer who owes the past-due support;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The social security number of that taxpayer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of past-due support owed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The alphabetical designation of the State submitting the  notification of liability for past-due support.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services may also require such other  information from the State submitting the notification as is necessary  for his orderly consolidation of data for transmittal to the Internal  Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transmittal of notification to Internal Revenue Service. The  Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, by December 1 of each  year, consolidate and transmit to the Internal Revenue Service on  magnetic tape the data contained in the notifications of liability for  past-due support submitted by the participating States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>  is to be submitted only for the purpose of completing or correcting the  information contained in the notification of liability for past-due  support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collection--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Priority of offset for outstanding tax  liability. Under section 6402(a) and Sec. 301.6402-1, the Commissioner  may credit any overpayment of tax against any outstanding liability for  any tax owed by the person making the overpayment. Only the balance  remaining after such crediting is available for offset under section  6402(c) of this section. Thus, if a taxpayer making an overpayment has  both an outstanding tax liability and a liability for past-due support  subject to this section, then the entire amount of the overpayment shall  be credited first against the outstanding tax liability under section  6402(a) and Sec. 301.6402-1 and only the remainder, if any, of the  overpayment will be offset by the amount of past-due support. However,  an overpayment shall be offset by an amount of past-due support under  section 6402(c) before any crediting of the overpayment to any future  liability for an internal revenue tax. Thus, for example, if no  outstanding tax liability is owed and the amount of an overpayment is  equal to or less than the amount of past-due support, the Internal  Revenue Service shall offset the overpayment by the amount of past-due  support before crediting the overpayment against the taxpayer's  estimated income tax for the succeeding taxable year under section  6402(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts subject to offset. The balance of any overpayment  remaining after a crediting of the overpayment under section 6402(a) to  any outstanding liability for tax on the part of the taxpayer shall be  offset by the amount of past-due support of which the Internal Revenue  Service has been notified under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts not subject to offset. The amount of an overpayment not  subject to offset for any liability for tax or for past-due support  shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of offset. The Internal Revenue Service shall notify the  taxpayer in writing of the amount and date of the offset for past-due  support and of the State to which this amount of past-due support has  been paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposition of amounts collected. Amounts collected under this  section shall be transferred to a special account maintained by the  Bureau of Government Financial Operations. The Internal Revenue Service  shall advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his delegate  on a monthly basis of the names and social security numbers of the  taxpayers from whom the amounts of past-due support were collected, of  the amounts collected from each taxpayer, and of the State on whose  behalf each collection was made. After authorization by the Division of  Finance of the Social Security Administration, the Bureau of Government  Financial Operations of the Department of the Treasury shall pay to the  participating States amounts equal to the amounts collected under this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Fee. A refund offset fee in the amount of $17.00 per offset for  taxable year 1981, or such greater or smaller amount as the Secretary of  the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have agreed  to be sufficient to reimburse the Internal Revenue Service for the full  cost of the offset procedure, shall be billed and collected from the  participating States by   the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his delegate and deposited  in the United States Treasury and credited to the appropriation accounts  of the Internal Revenue Service which bore all or part of the costs  involved in making the collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective dates. This section applies to refunds payable on or  before January 1, 1999. For the rules applicable after January 1, 1999,  see 31 CFR part 285.  [T.D. 7895, 48 FR 22709, May 20, 1983, as amended by T.D. 8837, 64 FR  48548, Sept. 7, 1999]</p>
