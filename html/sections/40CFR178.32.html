If some requests for a hearing are denied  and others pertaining to the same order or regulation are granted, the  denial order and the hearing notice may be combined into a single  document and shall be issued at the same time unless the Administrator  for good cause determines otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for an evidentiary hearing will be granted if the  Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution  at a hearing. An evidentiary hearing will not be granted on issues of  policy or law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a reasonable possibility that available evidence  identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more  of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account  uncontested claims or facts to the contrary. An evidentiary hearing   will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations, denials, or  general descriptions of positions and contentions, nor if the  Administrator concludes that the data and information submitted, even if  accurate, would be insufficient to justify the factual determination  urged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the  person requesting the hearing would be adequate to justify the action  requested. An evidentiary hearing will not be granted on factual issues  that are not determinative with respect to the action requested. For  example, a hearing will not be granted if the Administrator concludes  that the action would be the same even if the factual issue were  resolved in the manner sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where appropriate, the Administrator will make rulings on any  issues raised by an objection which are necessary for resolution prior  to determining whether a request for an evidentiary hearing should be  granted.</p>
