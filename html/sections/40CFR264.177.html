[Comment: As required by Sec. 264.13, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with Sec. 264.177. Also, Sec. 264.17(c) requires wastes analyses, trial tests or other documentation to assure compliance with Sec. 264.17(b). As required by Sec. 264.73, the owner or operator must place the results of each waste analysis and trial test, and any documented information, in the operating record of the facility.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A storage container holding a hazardous waste that is incompatible with any waste or other materials stored nearby in other containers, piles, open tanks, or surface impoundments must be separated from the other materials or protected from them by means of a dike, berm, wall, or other device.
[Comment: The purpose of this section is to prevent fires, explosions, gaseous emission, leaching, or other discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could result from the mixing of incompatible wastes or materials if containers break or leak.]</p>
