Except as otherwise provided by this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No person may purchase directly from any department or agency of the United States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such person acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and engages in exporting or selling for export, unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the same geographic and economic area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such person has, during the preceding 24-month period, exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No person may export or sell for export, unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the same geographic and economic area in the same calendar year that the person has unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the person's possession or under contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No person may purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands if such person sells or otherwise transfers unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing, to a third party if that third party or successive parties export that unprocessed private timber. A third party or successive parties who acquire such unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing may not export such timber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) (1)-(3) of this section shall not apply to specific quantities of grades and species of unprocessed timber which the Secretary of Agriculture has determined to be surplus to domestic manufacturing needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions.

The prohibition against the purchase of Federal timber for a person who has exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands, within the preceding 24-month period, shall not apply to a person with a historic export quota approved by the Secretary and who has been exporting unprocessed private timber in accordance with the log export and substitution regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture at 36 CFR part 223, subpart D, in effect before August 20, 1990, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That person certified in writing to the Regional Forester of the Region administering the historic export quota, on or before November 20, 1990, that the person would cease exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands on or before February 20, 1991, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The exporting ceased in accordance with such certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application for historic export quota exemption.

I hereby certify that I will cease all exporting of such unprocessed private timber from lands west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States of the United States by February 20, 1991. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided from such violation.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The certification must have been signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Indirect substitution prohibition. No person may purchase from any other person unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if such person would be prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section from purchasing such timber directly from a Department or agency of the United States, pursuant to Sec. 490(b) of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.). The prohibition in this paragraph does not apply to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To the acquisition of western red cedar, which is domestically processed into finished products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To a person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within an approved sourcing area, does not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved sourcing area while the approval is in effect, and, if applicable, receives a waiver of the prohibition against exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area during the preceding 24 months in accordance with Sec. 223.189 (f) and (g) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the limited amount of unprocessed National Forest System timber within Washington State that is exempt from the prohibition against indirect substitution, pursuant to Sec. 223.203.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Waiver within a sourcing area. The prohibitions in Sec. 223.189(a) (1) and (2) against direct and indirect acquisition of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands do not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person acquires such timber from within an approved sourcing area located west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has not exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands located within the approved sourcing area during the preceding 24 months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Does not export such private timber from within the approved sourcing area during the period the sourcing area is in effect; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Does not export such private timber during any calendar year in the same geographic and economic area that unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is under contract or in possession, if the sourcing area is no longer in effect, pursuant to the definition of substitution in 36 CFR 223.186.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The appropriate Regional Forester could waive, in writing, the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for any person who certified in writing, on or before November 20, 1990, that on or before February 20, 1991, that person would cease exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved sourcing area for a period of not less than three (3) years. Signatories of this certificate who received an approved sourcing area, like all holders of sourcing areas, are subject to the prohibition against exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area boundaries, pursuant to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Application for waiver within a sourcing area. To obtain a waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber described in paragraph (f) of this section, a person must have submitted a request for waiver, in writing, to the Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility being sourced is located, which must have been received by the Regional Forester on or before November 20, 1990, and which must have been signed by the person making such request or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer. The request for waiver must be notarized and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal affixed. The request shall be on company letterhead with its corporate seal affixed and must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the waiver request, for a period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A signed certification statement which reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0">``I have engaged in exporting of unprocessed timber originating from private land

located within the sourcing area for which I am applying. I desire to purchase directly from a department or agency of the United States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located within the desired sourcing area.
