                            <p class="depth0">Judicial or administrative review under sections 1869 or 1878 of the  Act or otherwise is prohibited with regard to the establishment of the  Federal rates. This prohibition includes the methodology used in the  computation of the Federal standardized payment rates, the case-mix  methodology, and the development and application of the wage index. This  prohibition on judicial and administrative review also extends to the  methodology used to establish the facility-specific rates but not to  determinations related to reasonable cost in the fiscal year 1995 cost  reporting period used as the basis for these rates.</p>
