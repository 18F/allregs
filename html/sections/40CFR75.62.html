The designated representative shall submit all of the  hardcopy information required under Sec. 75.53 to the appropriate EPA  Regional Office and the appropriate State and/or local air pollution  control agency prior to initial certification. Thereafter, the  designated representative shall submit hardcopy information only if that  portion of the monitoring plan is revised. The designated representative  shall submit the required hardcopy information as follows: no later than  21 days prior to the initial certification test; with any certification  or recertification application, if a hardcopy monitoring plan change is  associated with the certification or recertification event; and within  30 days of any other event with which a hardcopy monitoring plan change  is associated, pursuant to Sec. 75.53(b). Electronic submittal of all  monitoring plan information, including hardcopy portions, is permissible  provided that a paper copy of the hardcopy portions can be furnished  upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. Monitoring plans shall contain the information  specified in Sec. 75.53 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Format. The designated representative shall submit each  monitoring plan in a format specified by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> On and after April 27, 2011, consistent with Sec. 72.21 of this  chapter, a hardcopy cover letter signed by the Designated Representative  (DR) shall accompany each hardcopy monitoring plan submittal. The cover  letter shall include the certification statement described in  Sec. 72.21(b) of this chapter, and shall be submitted to the applicable  EPA Regional Office and to the appropriate State or local air pollution  control agency. For electronic monitoring plan submittals to the  Administrator, a cover letter is not required. However, at his or her  discretion, the DR may include important explanatory text or comments  with an electronic monitoring plan submittal, so long as the information  is provided in an electronic format that is compatible with the other  data required to be reported under this section.
