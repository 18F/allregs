Oral testimony and documentary evidence, including depositions that may have been taken as provided by statute and the rules of practices, may be offered in evidence on the claimant's behalf or by counsel for the Commission designated by it to represent the public interest opposed to the allowance of any unjust or unfounded claim or portion thereof; and either may cross-examine as to evidence offered through witnesses on behalf of the other. Objections to the admission of any such evidence will be ruled upon by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The hearings will be conducted as non-adversarial proceedings.

A claimant making such a request must notify the Commission at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date. When a stenographic record or transcript of a hearing is ordered at the claimant's request, the cost of the reporting and transcription will be charged to the claimant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The following rules of procedure will apply in the conduct of hearings held by the Commission for presentation of objections to Proposed Decisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Presentation of objections to Proposed Decisions.
