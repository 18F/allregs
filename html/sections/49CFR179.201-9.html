                            <p class="depth0">A gauging device of an approved design must be applied to permit  determining the liquid level of the lading. The gauging device must be  made of materials not subject to rapid deterioration by the lading. When  the interior pipe of the gauging device provides a means for passage of  the lading from the interior to the exterior of the tank, it must be  equipped with an excess flow valve of an approved design. If the opening  for passage of lading through the gauging device is not more than 0.060  inch diameter an excess flow valve is not required. The gauging device  must be provided with a protective housing.  [Amdt. 179-10, 36 FR 21353, Nov. 6, 1971]</p>
