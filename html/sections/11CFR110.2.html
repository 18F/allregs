This section applies to all contributions made by any  multicandidate political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3). See  11 CFR 102.2(a)(3) for multicandidate political committee certification  requirements. A political committee becomes a multicandidate committee  at the time the political committee meets the requirements of 11 CFR  100.5(e)(3) or becomes affiliated with an existing multicandidate  committee, whether or not the political committee has certified its  status as a multicandidate committee with the Commission in accordance  with 11 CFR 102.2(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice to recipients. Each multicandidate committee that makes a  contribution under this section shall notify the recipient in writing of  its status as a multicandidate committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contributions to candidates; designations; and redesignations.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No multicandidate political committee shall make contributions to  any candidate, his or her authorized political committees or agents with  respect to   any election for Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceed $5,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, with respect to any election  means--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the  contributor for a particular election, the election so designated.

To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts  outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political  committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from  the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by  11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date  of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following  action, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Refund the contribution using a committee check or draft; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another  election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.2(b)(5).</p><p class="depth5">If the candidate is not a candidate in the general election, all  contributions made for the general election shall be either returned or  refunded to the contributors or redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR  110.2(b)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>. The amount of the net debts outstanding shall be  adjusted as additional funds are received and expenditures are made.

Any  contribution made by such committee to a Senatorial candidate under this  paragraph in a year other than the calendar year in which the election  is held shall be considered to be made during the calendar year in which  the election is held.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contribution limitation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section  shall be increased by the percent difference in the price index in  accordance with 11 CFR 110.17. The increased contribution limitation  shall be in effect for the two calendar years starting on January 1 of  the year in which the contribution limitation is increased.

Contributions made to  retire debts resulting from elections held after December 31, 1974 are  subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contributions to committees supporting the same candidate. A  multicandidate political committee may contribute to a candidate or his  or her authorized committee with respect to a particular election and  also contribute to a political committee which has supported, or  anticipates supporting, the same candidate in the same election, as long  as--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient political committee is not the candidate's  principal campaign committee or other authorized political committee or  a single candidate committee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The multicandidate political committee does not give with the  knowledge that a substantial portion will be contributed to, or expended  on behalf of, that candidate for the same election; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The multicandidate political committee does not retain control  over the funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Application of limitations to elections. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The limitations on  contributions of this section (other than paragraph (e) of this section)  shall apply separately with respect to each election as defined in 11  CFR 100.2, except that all elections held in a calendar year for the  office of President of the United States (except a general election for  that office) shall be considered to be one election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An election in which a candidate is unopposed is a separate  election for the purposes of the limitations on contributions of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A primary or general election which is not held because a  candidate is unopposed or received a majority of votes in a previous  election is a separate election for the purposes of the limitations on  contributions of this section.
