However, any mixture of a waste  from the extraction, beneficiation, and processing of ores and minerals  excluded under Sec. 261.4(b)(7) and any other solid waste exhibiting a  characteristic of hazardous waste under subpart C is a hazardous waste  only if it exhibits a characteristic that would not have been exhibited  by the excluded waste alone if such mixture had not occurred, or if it  continues to exhibit any of the characteristics exhibited by the non- excluded wastes prior to mixture. Further, for the purposes of applying  the Toxicity Characteristic to such mixtures, the mixture is also a  hazardous waste if it exceeds the maximum concentration for any  contaminant listed in table 1 to Sec. 261.24 that would not have been  exceeded by the excluded waste alone if the mixture had not occurred or  if it continues to exceed the maximum concentration for any contaminant  exceeded by the nonexempt waste prior to mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is listed in subpart D of this part and has not been  excluded from the lists in subpart D of this part under Secs. 260.20 and  260.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> It is a mixture of solid waste and one or more hazardous wastes  listed in subpart D of this part and has not been excluded from  paragraph (a)(2) of this section under Secs. 260.20 and 260.22,  paragraph (g) of this section, or paragraph (h) of this section;  however, the following mixtures of solid wastes and hazardous wastes  listed in subpart D of this part are not hazardous wastes (except by  application of paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section) if the  generator can demonstrate that the mixture consists of wastewater the  discharge of which is subject to regulation under either section 402 or  section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act (including wastewater at  facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater) and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One or more of the following spent solvents listed in  Sec. 261.31--benzene, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene,  trichloroethylene or the scrubber waters derived-from the combustion of  these spent solvents--Provided, That the maximum total weekly usage of  these solvents (other than the amounts that can be demonstrated not to  be discharged to wastewater) divided by the average weekly flow of  wastewater into the headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment or  pretreatment system does not exceed 1 part per million, OR the total  measured concentration of these solvents entering the headworks of the  facility's wastewater treatment system (at facilities subject to  regulation under the Clean Air Act, as amended, at 40 CFR parts 60, 61,  or 63, or at facilities subject to an enforceable limit in a federal  operating permit that minimizes fugitive emissions), does not exceed 1  part per million on an average weekly basis. Any facility that uses  benzene as a solvent and claims this exemption must use an aerated  biological wastewater treatment system and must use only lined surface  impoundments or tanks prior to secondary clarification in the wastewater  treatment system.

Any manufacturing facility that  claims an exemption for de minimis quantities of wastes listed in  Secs. 261.31 through 261.32, or any nonmanufacturing facility that  claims an exemption for de minimis quantities of wastes listed in  subpart D of this part must either have eliminated the discharge of  wastewaters or have included in its Clean Water Act permit application  or submission to its pretreatment control authority the   constituents for which each waste was listed (in 40 CFR 261 appendix  VII) of this part; and the constituents in the table ``Treatment  Standards for Hazardous Wastes'' in 40 CFR 268.40 for which each waste  has a treatment standard (i.e., Land Disposal Restriction constituents).  A facility is eligible to claim the exemption once the permit writer or  control authority has been notified of possible de minimis releases via  the Clean Water Act permit application or the pretreatment control  authority submission.

Used oil containing more  than 1000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because  it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D  of part 261 of this chapter. Persons may rebut this presumption by  demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for  example, to show that the used oil does not contain significant  concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix  VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/ fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through  a tolling agreement, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids.
