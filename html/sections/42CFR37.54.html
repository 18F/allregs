A notice of the communication must be submitted to NIOSH. When significant abnormal findings are reported, NIOSH will also notify the miner to contact his or her physician.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, when NIOSH has more than one radiograph of a miner in its files and the most recent examination was found by the first physician to interpret the radiograph or subsequently by NIOSH B Readers to show an abnormality of cardiac shape or size, tuberculosis, cancer, complicated pneumoconiosis, and any other significant abnormal findings, NIOSH will arrange for a licensed physician to compare the most recent image and interpretation to older images and NIOSH will inform the miner of any significant changes or progression of disease or other findings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All final findings regarding pneumoconiosis will be sent to the miner by MSHA in accordance with section 203 of the Act (see 30 CFR part 90). Positive findings with regard to pneumoconiosis will be reported to the miner or to the miner's designated physician by NIOSH.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NIOSH will make every reasonable effort to process the findings described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of receipt of the information described in Sec.  37.60 in a complete and acceptable form. The information forwarded to MSHA will be in a form intended to facilitate prompt dispatch of the findings to the miner. The results of an examination made of a miner may not be processed by NIOSH if the examination was made within 6 months of the date of a previous acceptable examination.
