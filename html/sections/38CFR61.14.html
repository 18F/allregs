                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicants will first be grouped in categories according to the  funding priorities set forth in the NOFA, if any. Applicants will then  be ranked, within their respective funding category if applicable. The  highest-ranked applications for which funding is available, within  highest priority funding category if applicable, will be conditionally  selected to receive a capital grant in accordance with their ranked  order, as determined under Sec. 61.13. If funding priorities have been  established and funds are still available after selection of those  applicants in the highest priority group VA will continue to  conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in  accordance with the selection method set forth in this paragraph subject  to available funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of a tie between applicants, VA will use the score  from Sec. 61.13(g) to determine the ranking. If the score from Sec.  61.13(g) is also tied, VA will use the score from Sec. 61.13(d) to  determine the ranking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> VA may reject an application where the project is not cost  effective based on the cost and number of new supportive housing beds  made available--or based on the cost, amount, and types of supportive  services made available--when compared to other supportive housing or  services projects, and when adjusted for high cost areas. For those  applications that VA believes not to be cost-effective VA will;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the award; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not select the application for funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> VA may not reject an application solely on the basis that the  entity proposes to use funding from other private or public sources, if  the entity demonstrates that a private nonprofit organization will  provide oversight and site control for the project. In this section  ``private nonprofit organization'' means one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An incorporated private institution, organization, or  foundation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That has received, or has temporary clearance to receive, tax- exempt status under paragraph (2), (3), or (19) of section 501(c) of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For which no part of the net earnings of the institution,  organization, or foundation inures to the benefit of any member,  founder, or contributor of the institution, organization, or foundation;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That VA determines is financially responsible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A for-profit limited partnership or limited liability company,  the sole general partner or manager of which is an organization that is  described by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A corporation wholly owned and controlled by an organization  that is described by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the case of a previously awarded project that can no longer  provide services and or housing and the recipient agency has decided to  withdraw or the project has been terminated for failure to comply with  the terms and conditions of the award; VA may transfer a capital grant  or non-capital grant to another eligible entity in the same geographical  area without competition, in order to prevent a loss of capacity of  services and housing to homeless veterans. The new entity must meet all  of the requirements to which the original grantee was subject. In the  case of a capital grant transfer the new grantee will only be entitled  to the funding that remains from the original capital obligation and  remains responsible for all commitments made by the original grantee.
