Nothing in this paragraph (c)(3)  shall prohibit an investor from otherwise exercising rights it may have  as shareholder to protect the value of its investment, so long as the  exercise of such rights does not result in the investor's direct or  indirect control of the organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Investment limit. In calculating the amount that may be invested  in any organization under this section and Sec. Sec. 211.9 and 211.10  of this part, there shall be included any unpaid amount for which the  investor is liable and any investments in the same organization held by  affiliates under any authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Divestiture.
