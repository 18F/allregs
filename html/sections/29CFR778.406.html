                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any employment in which the employee's hours fluctuate only in the  overtime range above the maximum workweek prescribed by the statute  lacks the irregularity of hours for which the Supreme Court found the  so-called ``Belo'' contracts appropriate and so fails to meet the  requirements of section 7(f) which were designed to validate, subject to  express statutory limitations, contracts of a like kind in situations of  the type considered by the Court (see Sec. 778.404). Nothing in the  legislative history of section 7(f) suggests any intent to suspend the  normal application of the general overtime provisions of section 7(a) in  situations where the weekly hours of an employee fluctuate only when  overtime work in excess of the prescribed maximum weekly hours is  performed. Section 7(a) was specifically designed to deal with such a  situation by making such regular resort to overtime more costly to the  employer and thus providing an inducement to spread the work rather than  to impose additional overtime work on employees regularly employed for a  workweek of the maximum statutory length. The ``security of a regular  weekly income'' which the Supreme Court viewed as an important feature  of the ``Belo'' wage plan militating against a holding that the  contracts were invalid under the Act is, of course, already provided to  employees who regularly work at least the maximum number of hours  permitted without overtime pay under section 7(a). Their situation is  not comparable in this respect to employees whose duties cause their  weekly hours to fluctuate in such a way that some workweeks are short  and others long and they cannot, without some guarantee, know in advance  whether in a particular workweek they will be entitled to pay for the  regular number of hours of nonovertime work contemplated by section  7(a). It is such employees whose duties necessitate ``irregular hours''  within the meaning of section 7(f) and whose ``security of a regular  weekly income'' can be assured by a guarantee under that section which  will serve to increase their hourly earnings in short workweeks under  the statutory maximum hours. It is this benefit to the employee that the  Supreme Court viewed, in effect, as a quid pro quo which could serve to  balance a relaxation of the statutory requirement, applicable in other  cases, that any overtime work should cost the employer 50 percent more  per hour. In the enactment of section 7(f), as in the enactment of  section 7(b) (1) and (2), the benefits that might inure to employees  from a balancing of long workweeks against short workweeks under  prescribed safeguards would seem to be the reason most likely to have  influenced the legislators to provide express exemptions from the strict  application of section 7(a). Consequently, where the fluctuations in an  employee's hours of work resulting from his duties involve only overtime  hours worked in excess of the statutory maximum hours, the hours are not  ``irregular'' within the purport of section 7(f) and a payment plan  lacking this factor does not qualify for the exemption.
