                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 32.908(b), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts (MAY 2014)</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any other payment terms in this contract, the  Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions  specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made  on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer.  Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001,  and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to  in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However,  see paragraph (a)(3) concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and  legal holidays.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Invoice payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Types of invoice payments. For purposes of  this clause, there are several types of invoice payments that may occur  under this contract, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Progress payments, if provided for elsewhere in this contract,  based on Contracting Officer approval of the estimated amount and value  of work or services performed, including payments for reaching  milestones in any project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The due date for making such payments is 14 days after the  designated billing office receives a proper payment request. If the  designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the  actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date is  the 14th day after the date of the Contractor's payment request,  provided the designated billing office receives a proper payment request  and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor  compliance with contract requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the  Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232-5, Payments  Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, is as specified in the  contract or, if not specified, 30 days after approval by the Contracting  Officer for release to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work  and presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising  by virtue of the contract, and payments for partial deliveries that have  been accepted by the Government (e.g., each separate building, public  work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated  separately in the contract).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The due date for making such payments is the later of the  following two events:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a  proper invoice from the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services  completed by the Contractor. For a final invoice when the payment amount  is subject to contract settlement actions (e.g., release of claims),  acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract  settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice  with the date of actual receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice  payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's  invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper  invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or  Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(xi)</em> of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with  these requirements, the designated billing office must return it within  7 days after receipt, with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice.  When computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor, the Government  will take into account if the Government notifies the Contractor of an  improper invoice in an untimely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date  invoices as close as possible to the date of mailing or transmission.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contract number or other authorization for work or services  performed (including order number and contract line item number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Description of work or services performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Delivery and payment terms (e.g., discount for prompt payment  terms).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to  be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice  of assignment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing  address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> For payments described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this clause,  substantiation of the amounts requested and certification in accordance  with the requirements of the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed- Price Construction Contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall  include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the  invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice,  in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall  have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the  applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of  Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause  (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--System for Award  Management , or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other  Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived  the requirement to pay by EFT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Any other information or documentation required by the  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of this clause are met, if  applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or  legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the  following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Government processed a receiving report or other Government  documentation authorizing payment and there was no disagreement over  quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or  condition, or requested progress payment amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due  the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount was not  subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government  and the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the  interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget  prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might  be due the Contractor for payments described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of  this clause, Government acceptance or approval is deemed to occur  constructively on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the  work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the  contract. If actual acceptance or approval occurs within the  constructive acceptance or approval period, the Government will base the  determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance or  approval. Constructive acceptance or constructive approval requirements  do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or  Contractor compliance with a contract provision. These requirements also  do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve  Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make  payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not  require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are  due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the  payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on  amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of  the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims  involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable in accordance  with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will  pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the  Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment  improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in  accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Additional interest penalty. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The designated payment office  will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt  payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest  penalty amount only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty  within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment  office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph  (a)(6)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the  date the invoice amount is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Contractor shall support written demands for additional  penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not  request any additional data. The Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a  specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment  interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment  interest was due; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State that payment of the principal has been received, including  the date of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The designated payment office that receives the demand will  annotate it with the date of receipt provided the demand is received on  or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the designated payment office fails to make the required  annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on  the date the Contractor has placed on the demand, provided such date is  no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contract financing payments. If this contract provides for  contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments  in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subcontract clause requirements. The Contractor shall include in  each subcontract for property or services (including a material  supplier) for the purpose of performing this contract the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prompt payment for subcontractors. A payment clause that  obligates the Contractor to pay the subcontractor for satisfactory  performance under its subcontract not later than 7 days from receipt of  payment out of such amounts as are paid to the Contractor under this  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest for subcontractors. An interest penalty clause that  obligates the Contractor to pay to the subcontractor an interest penalty  for each payment not made in accordance with the payment clause--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the period beginning on the day after the required payment  date and ending on the date on which payment of the amount due is made;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary  of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest  payments under 41 U.S.C. 7109 in effect at the time the Contractor  accrues the obligation to pay an interest penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subcontractor clause flowdown. A clause requiring each  subcontractor tou</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Include a payment clause and an interest penalty clause  conforming to the standards set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of  this clause in each of its subcontracts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require each of its subcontractors to include such clauses in  their subcontracts with each lower-tier subcontractor or supplier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subcontract clause interpretation. The clauses required by  paragraph (c) of this clause shall not be construed to impair the right  of the Contractor or a subcontractor at any tier to negotiate, and to  include in their subcontract, provisions that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Retainage permitted. Permit the Contractor or a subcontractor to  retain (without cause) a specified percentage of each progress payment  otherwise due to a subcontractor for satisfactory performance under the  subcontract without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment  interest penalty, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to by  the parties to the subcontract, giving such recognition as the parties  deem appropriate to the ability of a subcontractor to furnish a  performance bond and a payment bond;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding permitted. Permit the Contractor or subcontractor to  make a determination that part or all of the subcontractor's request for  payment may be withheld in accordance with the subcontract agreement;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Withholding requirements. Permit such withholding without  incurring any obligation to pay a late payment penalty if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A notice conforming to the standards of paragraph (g) of this  clause previously has been furnished to the subcontractor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor furnishes to the Contracting Officer a copy of  any notice issued by a Contractor pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of  this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Subcontractor withholding procedures. If a Contractor, after  making a request for payment to the Government but before making a  payment to a subcontractor for the subcontractor's performance covered  by the payment request, discovers that all or a portion of the payment  otherwise due such subcontractor is subject to withholding from the  subcontractor in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then the  Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subcontractor notice. Furnish to the subcontractor a notice  conforming to the standards of paragraph (g) of this clause as soon as  practicable upon ascertaining the cause giving rise to a withholding,  but prior to the due date for subcontractor payment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracting Officer notice. Furnish to the Contracting Officer,  as soon as practicable, a copy of the notice furnished to the  subcontractor pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subcontractor progress payment reduction. Reduce the  subcontractor's progress payment by an amount not to exceed the amount  specified in the notice of withholding furnished under paragraph (e)(1)  of this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subsequent subcontractor payment. Pay the subcontractor as soon  as practicable after the correction of the identified subcontract  performance deficiency, and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Make such payment within--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Seven days after correction of the identified subcontract  performance deficiency (unless the funds therefor must be recovered from  the Government because of a reduction under paragraph (e)(5)(i)) of this  clause; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Seven days after the Contractor recovers such funds from the  Government; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty  computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the  Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments  under 41   U.S.C. 7109 in effect at the time the Contractor accrues the obligation  to pay an interest penalty;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice to Contracting Officer. Notify the Contracting Officer  upon--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reduction of the amount of any subsequent certified application  for payment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment to the subcontractor of any withheld amounts of a  progress payment, specifying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amounts withheld under paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The dates that such withholding began and ended; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Interest to Government. Be obligated to pay to the Government an  amount equal to interest on the withheld payments (computed in the  manner provided in 31 U.S.C. 3903(c)(1)), from the 8th day after receipt  of the withheld amounts from the Government until--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The day the identified subcontractor performance deficiency is  corrected; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date that any subsequent payment is reduced under paragraph  (e)(5)(i) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Third-party deficiency reports--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Withholding from  subcontractor. If a Contractor, after making payment to a first-tier  subcontractor, receives from a supplier or subcontractor of the first- tier subcontractor (hereafter referred to as a ``second-tier  subcontractor'') a written notice in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 3133,  asserting a deficiency in such first-tier subcontractor's performance  under the contract for which the Contractor may be ultimately liable,  and the Contractor determines that all or a portion of future payments  otherwise due such first-tier subcontractor is subject to withholding in  accordance with the subcontract agreement, the Contractor may, without  incurring an obligation to pay an interest penalty under paragraph  (e)(6) of this clause--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice conforming to  the standards of paragraph (g) of this clause as soon as practicable  upon making such determination; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withhold from the first-tier subcontractor's next available  progress payment or payments an amount not to exceed the amount  specified in the notice of withholding furnished under paragraph  (f)(1)(i) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent payment or interest charge. As soon as practicable,  but not later than 7 days after receipt of satisfactory written  notification that the identified subcontract performance deficiency has  been corrected, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pay the amount withheld under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this  clause to such first-tier subcontractor; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty to  such first-tier subcontractor computed at the rate of interest  established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the  Federal Register, for interest payments under 41 U.S.C. 7109 in effect  at the time the Contractor accrues the obligation to pay an interest  penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Written notice of subcontractor withholding. The Contractor  shall issue a written notice of any withholding to a subcontractor (with  a copy furnished to the Contracting Officer), specifying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount to be withheld;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The specific causes for the withholding under the terms of the  subcontract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The remedial actions to be taken by the subcontractor in order  to receive payment of the amounts withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Subcontractor payment entitlement.

A dispute between the Contractor  and subcontractor relating to the amount or entitlement of a  subcontractor to a payment or a late payment interest penalty under a  clause included in the subcontract pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  clause does not constitute a dispute to which the Government is a party.

A cost-reimbursement claim may not include  any amount for reimbursement of such interest penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Overpayments.
