                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The most efficient use of existing on- and off-street parking  space should be stressed on a nonreserved (first-come, first-served)  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reserved parking facilities should be designated as parking by  permit or numerically by category of eligible parkers. Designation of  parking spaces by name, grade, rank, or title should be avoided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow  on an installation. Strong enforcement of parking restrictions results  in better use of available parking facilities and eliminates conditions  causing traffic accidents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ``Denver boot'' device is authorized for use as a technique  to assist in the enforcement of parking violations where immobilization  of the POV is necessary for safety. Under no circumstances should the  device be used to punish or ``teach a lesson'' to violators. Booting  should not be used if other reasonably effective but less restrictive  means of enforcement (such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands,  revocations, or suspensions of on-post driving privileges) are  available. Procedures for booting must be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Local standing operating procedures (SOPs) must be developed to  control the discretion of enforcers and limit booting to specific  offenses. SOPs should focus on specific reasons for booting, such as  immobilization of unsafe, uninspected, or unregistered vehicles or  compelling the presence of repeat offenders. All parking violations must  be clearly outlined in the installation traffic code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drivers should be placed on notice that particular violations or  multiple violations may result in booting. Also, drivers must be  provided with a prompt hearing and an opportunity to obtain the release  of their property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To limit liability, drivers must be warned when a boot is  attached to their vehicle and instructed how to have the boot removed  without damaging the vehicle.</p>
