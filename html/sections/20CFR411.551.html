                                Sec. 411.551  How are EN payments calculated for transition cases
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A Transition case is a case where a ticket had been assigned and  milestones or outcomes had been attained as of June 30, 2008 (that is,  the individual has completed the necessary work to trigger a milestone  or outcome payment before July 21, 2008 regardless   of whether the payment has actually been made). We will pay outcome and  milestone payments at the rate in effect when the work leading to such  outcome or milestone is attained. Since milestone and outcome payments  are numbered and attained in sequence, the EN must request the final  payment for which it expects payment under the prior rules before we can  determine the number of the milestone or outcome payment that represents  the first payment after July 21, 2008. In addition, for cases on which  an EN has attained an outcome payment before July 21, 2008 we must know  the sum of the amount paid on the ticket before we can determine the  remaining amount that can be paid in outcome payments on the ticket.  Therefore, with respect to a ticket, we will only accept payment  requests for milestones or outcomes attained under the prior rules until  March 31, 2009 or until we make the first payment on the ticket under  Sec. 411.525. Payments to an EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN)  after July 21, 2008 on a transition case will be made as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The four milestones under the prior rules will be equated with  the four Phase 1 milestones available under the rules after July 21,  2008. For example, if a beneficiary had attained milestone 1 under our  prior rules (1 month above the gross SGA level, e.g., $940 in 2008),  then the next milestone to be achieved would be Phase 1 milestone 2  under these rules (work in three months with gross earnings in each of  these months equal to a trial work period service month, e.g., $670 in  2008).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the beneficiary had attained all four of the milestones under  the prior rules, the next milestone to be achieved would be the first  Phase 2 milestone (a calendar month in which the beneficiary has worked  and has gross earnings from employment or net earnings from self- employment that are more than the substantial gainful activity threshold  level, e.g., $900 in 2007).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The maximum number of outcome payments available to an EN with  respect to a ticket for a transition case will be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First, we will compute the total dollar amount already paid or  payable with respect to a ticket, including all outcome and milestone  payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Then, we will subtract the total dollar amount already paid from  the total value of the ticket under the new rules for the year when  these rules take effect. The total value of the ticket will be  calculated based on the elected payment system for the beneficiary,  i.e., the outcome or the outcome-milestone payment system, and on the  appropriate payment calculation base for either a title II disability  beneficiary (including a concurrent title II and title XVI disability)  or a title XVI disability beneficiary (see Secs. 411.500 and 411.505).  For accounting purposes, we will use the payment calculation base for  2008 and assume that all payments could be earned in that year in  calculating the total value of the ticket.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We then will divide this amount by the applicable outcome  payment amount (whether title II or title XVI) payable for 2008 and  round the result in accordance with customary rounding principles. The  resulting number represents the number of outcome payments available to  be paid with respect to the ticket. In no case can this number exceed  60.  [73 FR 29349, May 20, 2008]</p>
