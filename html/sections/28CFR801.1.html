                            <p class="depth0">If an agency employee is acting within the scope of his or her  employment and causes injury to a member of the public, any claim for  money damages for personal injury, death, damage to property, or loss of  property caused by the employee's negligent or wrongful act or omission  is a claim against the United States and must first be presented by the  injured party to the appropriate federal agency for administrative  action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. General provisions for   processing such administrative claims are contained in 28 CFR part 14.  The provisions in this part supplement the general provisions in order  to describe specific procedures to follow when filing a claim with the  Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of  Columbia (``CSOSA'') or the District of Columbia Pretrial Services  Agency (``PSA'').</p>
