                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification of alleged unauthorized carrier change. Executing  carriers who are informed of an unauthorized carrier change by a  subscriber must immediately notify both the authorized and allegedly  unauthorized carrier of the incident. This notification must include the  identity of both carriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral of complaint. Any carrier, executing, authorized, or  allegedly unauthorized, that is informed by a subscriber or an executing  carrier of an unauthorized carrier change shall direct that subscriber  either to the state commission or, where the state commission has not  opted to administer these rules, to the Federal Communications  Commission's Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau, for resolution of  the complaint. Carriers shall also inform the subscriber that he or she  may contact and seek resolution from the alleged unauthorized carrier  and, in addition, may contact the authorized carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of receipt of complaint. Upon receipt of an  unauthorized carrier change complaint, the relevant governmental agency  will notify the allegedly unauthorized carrier of the complaint and  order that the carrier remove all unpaid charges for the first 30 days  after the slam from the subscriber's bill pending a determination of  whether an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(e), has  occurred, if it has not already done so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proof of verification. Not more than 30 days after notification  of the complaint, or such lesser time as is required by the state  commission if a matter is brought before a state commission, the alleged  unauthorized carrier shall provide to the relevant government agency a  copy of any valid proof of verification of the carrier change. This  proof of verification must contain clear and convincing evidence of a  valid authorized carrier change, as that term is defined in Sec. Sec.  64.1120 through 64.1130. The relevant governmental agency will determine  whether an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(e), has  occurred using such proof and any evidence supplied by the subscriber.  Failure by the carrier to respond or provide proof of verification will  be presumed to be clear and convincing evidence of a violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, while a complaint based on the  same set of facts is pending with a state commission.
