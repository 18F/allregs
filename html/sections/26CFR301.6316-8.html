The amount of any such refund made in foreign currency shall  be the amount of the overpayment in U.S. dollars converted, on the date  of the refund check, at the rate of exchange then used for his official  disbursements by the disbursing officer of the Department of State in  the country where the foreign currency was originally deposited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credits. Unless otherwise in the best interest of the Internal  Revenue Service, no credit of any overpayment of tax which has been paid  under section 6316 in foreign currency shall be allowed against any  outstanding liability of the person making the overpayment except in  respect of that portion or the liability which, in accordance with Sec.  301.6316-1 or Sec. 301.6316-7, would otherwise be permitted to be paid  in the same foreign currency.</p>
