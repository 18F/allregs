A bulk parameter that measures the total mass of chlorinated organic matter in water and wastewater. The approved method of analysis for AOX is Method 1650, which is available in Appendix A of this part, and online at http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/index.cfm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual average.

All process equipment used for bleaching beginning with the first application of bleaching agents (e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite, or peroxide), each subsequent extraction stage, and each subsequent stage where bleaching agents are applied to the pulp. For mills in subpart E of this part producing specialty grades of pulp, the bleach plant includes process equipment used for the hydrolysis or extraction stages prior to the first application of bleaching agents. Process equipment used for oxygen delignification prior to the application of bleaching agents is not part of the bleach plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bleach plant effluent.
