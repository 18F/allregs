The pressure sensor or tap must be located close to the water discharge point. The Administrator shall have discretion to grant requests for approval of alternative monitoring locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All monitoring devices under paragraph (a) of this section are to be recalibrated annually in accordance with procedures under Sec. 60.13(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of each affected facility constructed, reconstructed, or modified after April 28, 2008, that has one or more mechanical vents must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate the monitoring devices specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable to the mechanical vent and any control device installed on the vent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For mechanical vents with fabric filters (baghouses) with design controlled potential PM emissions rates of 25 Mg (28 tons) per year or more, a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For mechanical vents with wet scrubbers, monitoring devices according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A monitoring device for the continuous measurement of the pressure loss through the venturi constriction of the control equipment. The monitoring device is to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 1 inch water gauge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A monitoring device for the continuous measurement of the water supply flow rate to the control equipment. The monitoring device is to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of design water supply flow rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A monitoring device for the continuous measurement of the pH of the wet scrubber liquid. The monitoring device is to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of design pH.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An average value for each monitoring parameter must be determined during each performance test. Each monitoring parameter must then be maintained within 10 percent of the value established during the most recent performance test on an operating day average basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For mechanical vents with control equipment other than wet scrubbers, a monitoring device for the continuous measurement of the reagent injection flow rate to the control equipment, as applicable. The monitoring device is to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of design injection flow rate. An average reagent injection flow rate value must be determined during each performance test. The reagent injection flow rate must then be maintained within 10 percent of the value established during the most recent performance test on an operating day average basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each bag leak detection system used to comply with provisions of this subpart must be installed, calibrated, maintained, and continuously operated according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot (gr/acf)) or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. The owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, the owner or operator must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator must not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The owner or operator must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation

and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. This plan must be submitted to the Administrator or delegated authority 30 days prior to startup of the affected facility. The owner or operator must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow the owner and operator more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each bag leak detection system, the owner or operator must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section, the owner or operator must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in PM emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.</p>
