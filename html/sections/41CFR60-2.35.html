                            <p class="depth0">No contractor's compliance status will be judged alone by whether it  reaches its goals. The composition of the contractor's workforce (i.e.,  the employment of minorities or women at a percentage rate below, or  above, the goal level) does not, by itself, serve as a basis to impose  any of the sanctions authorized by Executive Order 11246 and the  regulations in this chapter. Each contractor's compliance with its  affirmative action obligations will be determined by reviewing the  nature and extent of the contractor's good faith affirmative action  activities as required under Sec. 60-2.17, and the appropriateness of  those activities to identified equal employment opportunity problems.  Each contractor's compliance with its nondiscrimination obligations will  be determined by analysis of statistical data and other non-statistical  information which would indicate whether employees and applicants are  being treated without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual  orientation, gender identity, or national origin.
