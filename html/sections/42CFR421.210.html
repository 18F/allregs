                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis.

This authority has been delegated to CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of claims. Claims for the following, except for items incident to a physician's professional service as defined in Sec. 410.26, incident to a physician's service in a rural health clinic as defined in Sec. 405.2413, or bundled into payment to a provider, ambulatory surgical center, or other facility, are processed by the designated carrier for its designated region and not by other carriers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Durable medical equipment (and related supplies) as defined in section 1861(n) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prosthetic devices (and related supplies) as described in section 1861(s)(8) of the Act, (including intraocular lenses and parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies, and equipment, when furnished under the prosthetic device benefit);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Orthotics and prosthetics (and related supplies) as described in section 1861(s)(9);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Home dialysis supplies and equipment as described in section 1861(s)(2)(F);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Surgical dressings and other devices as described in section 1861(s)(5);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Immunosuppressive drugs as described in section 1861(s)(2)(J); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other items or services which are designated by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Region designation.

section based on appropriate criteria and considerations, including the effect of the change on beneficiaries and DMEPOS suppliers. To announce changes, CMS publishes a notice in the Federal Register that delineates the regional boundary or boundaries changed, the States and territories affected, and supporting criteria or considerations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for designating regional carriers. CMS designates regional carriers to achieve a greater degree of effectiveness and efficiency in the administration of the Medicare program. In making this designation, CMS will award regional carrier contracts in accordance with applicable law and will consider some or all of the following criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timeliness of claim processing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost per claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claim processing quality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Experience in claim processing, and in establishing local medical review policy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other criteria that CMS believes to be pertinent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Carrier designation. (1) Each carrier designated a regional carrier must process claims for items listed in paragraph (b) of this section for beneficiaries whose permanent residence is within that carrier's region as designated under paragraph (c) of this section. When processing the claims, the carrier must use the payment rates applicable for the State of residence of the beneficiary, including a qualified Railroad Retirement beneficiary. A beneficiary's permanent residence is the address at which he or she intends to spend 6 months or more of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each carrier designated a regional carrier must process claims for items listed in paragraph (b) of this section for beneficiaries whose permanent residence is within that carrier's region as designated under paragraph (c) of this section. When processing the claims, the carrier must use the payment rates applicable for the State of residence of the beneficiary, including a qualified Railroad Retirement beneficiary. A beneficiary's permanent residence is the address at which he or she intends to spend 6 months or more of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS notifies affected Medicare beneficiaries and suppliers when it designates a regional carrier (in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) to process DMEPOS claims (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for all Medicare beneficiaries residing in their respective regions (as designated under paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS may contract for the performance of National Supplier Clearinghouse functions through a contract amendment to one of the DME regional carrier contracts or through a contract amendment to any Medicare carrier contract under Sec. 421.200.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS periodically recompetes the contracts for the DME regional carriers. CMS also periodically recompetes the National Supplier Clearinghouse function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Collecting information of ownership.
