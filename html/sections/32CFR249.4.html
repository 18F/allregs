                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Encourage the presentation of scientific and technical information generated by or for the Department of Defense at technical meetings consistent

with United States laws and the requirements of national security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permit DoD Components to conduct scientific and technical conferences, and to permit DoD Component personnel to attend and participate in scientific and technical conferences that are of demonstrable value to the Department of Defense, and consult with professional societies and associations in organizing meetings of the societies and associations that are mutually beneficial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allow the publication and public presentation of unclassified contracted fundamental research results. The mechanism for control of information generated by DoD-funded contracted fundamental research in science, technology, and engineering performed under contract or grant at colleges, universities, and non-government laboratories is security classification. No other type of control is authorized unless required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release information at meetings in a manner consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements for protecting the information. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, protection of classified, unclassified export-controlled, proprietary, privacy, and foreign government provided information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provide timely review of DoD employee and contractor papers intended for presentation at scientific and technical conferences and meetings, and if warranted and authorized by contract in the case of contractor employees, prescribe limitations on these presentations. Dissemination restrictions shall be used only when appropriate authority exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Assist DoD contractors and, when practical, others in determining the sensitivity of or the applicability of export controls to technical data proposed for public disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Approve release of classified or controlled unclassified DoD information to foreign representatives when such release promotes mutual security or advances the interests of an international military agreement or understanding in accordance with foreign disclosure policies of the Department of Defense. Presentation of such information at technical meetings attended by foreign representatives is appropriate when the release is made under the terms of existing security arrangements and when the Department of Defense and receiving government have established an understanding or agreement in that specific scientific or technical area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Refrain from interfering with the planning and organizing of meetings sponsored and conducted by non-government organizations. The type and level of DoD participation in such meetings will be determined taking account of such factors as benefit to the Department of Defense and how the meetings are being conducted.</p>
