In instances when the information is insufficient to insure that disclosure will be to the individual to whom the information pertains, in view of the sensitivity of the information, SSS reserves the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ordinarily the requester will be informed whether the named system of records contains a record pertaining to the requester within 10 days of receipt of such a request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal federal holidays). Such a response will also contain or reference the procedures which must be followed by the individual making the request in order to gain access to the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a response cannot be made within the 10 days, the records manager will inform the requester of the reason for the delay and the date by which a response may be anticipated.
