                            <p class="depth0">If a data breach involving sensitive personal information that is  processed or maintained by VA occurs and the Secretary has not  determined under Sec. 75.114 that an accelerated response is  appropriate, the Secretary shall ensure that, as soon as possible after  the data breach, a non-VA entity with relevant expertise in data breach  assessment and risk analysis or VA's Office of Inspector General  conducts an independent risk analysis of the data breach. The  preparation of the risk analysis may include data mining if necessary  for the development of relevant information. The risk analysis shall  include a finding with supporting rationale concerning whether the  circumstances create a reasonable risk that sensitive personal  information potentially may be misused. If the risk analysis concludes  that the data breach presents a reasonable risk for the potential misuse  of sensitive personal information, the risk analysis must also contain  operational recommendations for responding to the data breach. Each risk  analysis, regardless of findings and operational recommendations, shall  also address all relevant information concerning the data breach,  including the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of the event, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date of occurrence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Data elements involved, including any personally identifiable  information, such as full name, social security number, date of birth,  home address, account number, disability code;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly  accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g.,  unencrypted, plain text;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Time the data has been out of VA control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or  has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized  persons); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information,  if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Data breach analysis, as appropriate.
