                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding Sec. 51.605(b), the following types of restrictions on resale may be imposed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cross-class selling. A state commission may permit an incumbent LEC to prohibit a requesting telecommunications carrier that purchases at wholesale rates for resale, telecommunications services that the incumbent LEC makes available only to residential customers or to a limited class of residential customers, from offering such services to classes of customers that are not eligible to subscribe to such services from the incumbent LEC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Short term promotions. An incumbent LEC shall apply the wholesale discount to the ordinary rate for a retail service rather than a special promotional rate only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such promotions involve rates that will be in effect for no more than 90 days; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The incumbent LEC does not use such promotional offerings to evade the wholesale rate obligation, for example by making available a sequential series of 90-day promotional rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to any restrictions on resale not permitted under paragraph (a), an incumbent LEC may impose a restriction only if it proves to the state commission that the restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Branding. Where operator, call completion, or directory assistance service is part of the service or service package an incumbent LEC offers for resale, failure by an incumbent LEC to comply with reseller unbranding or rebranding requests shall constitute a restriction on resale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An incumbent LEC may impose such a restriction only if it proves to the state commission that the restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, such as by proving to a state

commission that the incumbent LEC lacks the capability to comply with unbranding or rebranding requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this subpart, unbranding or rebranding shall mean that operator, call completion, or directory assistance services are offered in such a manner that an incumbent LEC's brand name or other identifying information is not identified to subscribers, or that such services are offered in such a manner that identifies to subscribers the requesting carrier's brand name or other identifying information.</p>
