                            <p class="depth0">Where the Secretary acquires a property and thereafter it becomes necessary for the Secretary to reconvey the property to the mortgagee due to the mortgagee's noncompliance with these regulations or the application for insurance benefits is withdrawn with the consent of the Secretary, the mortgagee shall reimburse the Secretary for all expenses incurred in connection with such acquisition and reconveyance. The reimbursement shall include interest on the amount of insurance benefits refunded by the mortgagee from the date the insurance benefits were paid to the date of refund at an interest rate set in conformity with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, and the Secretary's cost of holding the property, accruing on a daily basis, from the date the deed to the Secretary was filed for record to the date of reconveyance. These costs are based on the Secretary's estimate of the taxes, maintenance and operating expenses of the property, and administrative expenses. Appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Secretary on account of any income received from the property.
