                            <p class="depth0">The following procedures and restrictions apply to licensee  modifications of authorized broadcast transmission system facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following changes are prohibited:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those that would result in the emission of signals outside of  the authorized channel exceeding limits prescribed for the class of  service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those that would cause the transmission system to exceed the  equipment performance measurements prescribed for the class of service  (AM, Sec.  73.44; FM, Sec. Sec.  73.317, 73.319, and 73.322; TV and  Class A TV, Sec. Sec.  73.682 and 73.687).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following changes may be made only after the grant of a  construction permit application on FCC Form 301 for commercial stations  or Form 340 for noncommercial educational stations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any construction of a new tower structure for broadcast  purposes, except for replacement of an existing tower with a new tower  of identical height and geographic coordinates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any change in station geographic coordinates, including  coordinate corrections of more than 3 seconds latitude and/or 3 seconds  longitude. FM and TV directional stations must also file a construction  permit application for any move of the antenna to another tower  structure located at the same coordinates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any change which would require an increase along any azimuth in  the composite directional antenna pattern of an FM station from the  composite directional antenna pattern authorized (see Sec.  73.316), or  any increase from the authorized directional antenna pattern for a TV  broadcast (see Sec.  73.685) or Class A TV station (see Sec.  73.6025).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any change in the directional radiation characteristics of an AM  directional antenna system. See Sec.  73.45 and Sec.  73.150.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any decrease in the authorized power of an AM station or the ERP  of a TV or Class A TV station, or any decrease or increase in the ERP of  an FM commercial station, which is intended for compliance with the  multiple ownership rules in Sec.  73.3555.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For FM noncommercial educational stations, any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any increase in the authorized maximum ERP, whether horizontally  or vertically polarized, for a noncommercial educational FM station  operating on Channels 201 through 220, or a Class D FM station operating  on Channel 200.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For those FM noncommercial educational stations on Channels 201  to 220, or a Class D FM station operating on Channel 200, which are  within the separation distances specified in Table A of Sec.  73.525  with respect to a Channel 6 television station, any increase in the  horizontally or vertically polarized ERP from the presently authorized  ERP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For those FM noncommercial educational stations on Channels  201 through 220 which are located within the separation distances in  Sec.  73.525 with respect to a Channel 6 television station, or a Class  D FM station operating on Channel 200, any decrease in the presently  authorized horizontal effective radiated power which would eliminate the  horizontal ERP to result in use of vertical ERP only.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For those FM noncommercial educational stations which employ  separate antennas for the horizontal ERP and the vertical ERP, mounted  at different heights, the station may not increase or decrease either  the horizontal ERP or the vertical ERP without a construction permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em>, or in Sec.  73.1675(c)(1) in the case of auxiliary  facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A commercial TV or noncommercial educational TV station  operating on Channels 14 or Channel 69 or a Class A TV station on  Channel 14 may increase its horizontally or vertically polarized ERP  only after the grant of a construction permit. A television or Class A  television station on Channels 15 through 21 within 341 km of a  cochannel land mobile operation, or 225 km of a first-adjacent channel  land mobile operation, must also obtain a construction permit before  increasing the horizontally or vertically polarized ERP (see part 74,  Sec.  74.709(a) and (b) for tables of urban areas and corresponding  reference coordinates of potentially affected land mobile operations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any change in the community of license, where the proposed new  facilities are the same as, or would be mutually exclusive with, the  licensee's or permittee's present assignment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(9)</em> of  this section, where the installation is located on or near an AM tower,  as defined in Sec.  1.30002, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with  Sec.  1.30003 or Sec.  1.30002, as applicable, is also required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Replacement of a directional FM antenna, where the measured  composite directional antenna pattern does not exceed the licensed  composite directional pattern at any azimuth, where no change in  effective radiated power will result, and where compliance with the  principal coverage requirements of Sec.  73.315(a) will be maintained by  the measured directional pattern. The antenna must be mounted not more  than 2 meters above or 4 meters below the authorized values. The  modification of license application on Form 302-FM to cover the antenna  replacement must contain all of the data in the following sections (i)  through (v). Program test operations at one half (50%) power may  commence immediately upon installation pursuant to Sec.  73.1620(a)(3).  However, if the replacement directional antenna is an exact replacement  (i.e., no change in manufacturer, antenna model number, AND measured  composite antenna pattern), program test operations may commence  immediately upon installation at the full authorized power.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A measured directional antenna pattern and tabulation on the  antenna manufacturer's letterhead showing both the horizontally and  vertically polarized radiation components and demonstrating that neither  of the components exceeds the authorized composite antenna pattern along  any azimuth.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contour protection stations authorized pursuant to Sec.  73.215  or Sec.  73.509 must attach a showing that the RMS (root mean square) of  the composite measured directional antenna pattern   is 85% or more of the RMS of the authorized composite antenna pattern.  See Sec.  73.316(c)(9).

The antenna measurements  must be performed with the antenna mounted on a tower, tower section, or  scale model equivalent to that on which the antenna will be permanently  mounted, and the tower or tower section must include transmission lines,  ladders, conduits, other antennas, and any other installations which may  affect the measured directional pattern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A certification from a licensed surveyor that the antenna has  been oriented to the proper azimuth.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A certification from a qualified engineer who oversaw  installation of the directional antenna that the antenna was installed  pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A directional TV on Channels 2 through 13 or 22 through 68 or a  directional Class A TV on Channels 2 through 13 or 22 through 51, or a  directional TV or Class A TV station on Channels 15 through 21 which is  in excess of 341 km (212 miles) from a cochannel land mobile operation  or in excess of 225 km (140 miles) from a first-adjacent channel land  mobile operation (see part 74, Sec.  74.709(a) and (b) for tables of  urban areas and reference coordinates of potentially affected land  mobile operations), may replace a directional TV or Class A TV antenna  by a license modification application, if the proposed horizontal  theoretical directional antenna pattern does not exceed the licensed  horizontal directional antenna pattern at any azimuth and where no  change in effective radiated power will result. The modification of  license application on Form 302-TV or Form 302-CA must contain all of  the data set forth in Sec.  73.685(f) or Sec.  73.6025(a), as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commercial and noncommercial educational FM stations operating  on Channels 221 through 300 (except Class D), NTSC TV stations operating  on Channels 2 through 13 and 22 through 68, Class A TV stations  operating on Channels 2 through 13 and 22 through 51, and TV and Class A  TV stations operating on Channels 15 through 21 that are in excess of  341 km (212 miles) from a cochannel land mobile operation or in excess  of 225 km (140 miles) from a first-adjacent channel land mobile  operation (see part 74, Sec.  74.709(a) and (b) for tables of urban  areas and reference coordinates of potentially affected land mobile  operations), which operate omnidirectionally, may increase the  vertically polarized effective radiated power up to the authorized  horizontally polarized effective radiated power in a license  modification application. Noncommercial educational FM licensees and  permittees on Channels 201 through 220, that do not use separate  antennas mounted at different heights for the horizontally polarized ERP  and the vertically polarized ERP, and are located in excess of the  separations from a Channel 6 television station listed in Table A of  Sec.  73.525(a)(1), may also increase the vertical ERP, up to (but not  exceeding) the authorized horizontally polarized ERP via a license  modification application. Program test operations may commence at full  power pursuant to Sec.  73.1620(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Those Class A FM commercial stations which were permitted to  increase ERP pursuant to MM Docket No. 88-375 by a modification of  license application remain eligible to do so, provided that the station  meets the requirements of Sec.  73.1690 (c)(1) and is listed on one of  the Public Notices as authorized to increase ERP, or by a letter from  the Commission's staff authorizing the change. These Public Notices were  released on November 3, 1989; November 17, 1989; December 8, 1989; March  2, 1990; and February 11, 1991. The increased ERP must comply with the  multiple ownership requirements of Sec.  73.3555. Program test  operations may commence at full power pursuant to Sec.  73.1620(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> and  (c)(7)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> FM omnidirectional commercial stations, and omnidirectional  noncommercial educational FM stations operating on Channels 221 through  300 (except Class D), which are not designated as contour protection  stations pursuant to Sec.  73.215 and which meet the spacing  requirements of Sec.  73.207, may file a license modification  application to increase ERP to the maximum permitted for the station  class, provided that any change in the height of the antenna radiation  center remains in accordance with Sec.  73.1690(c)(1). Program test  operations may commence at full power pursuant to Sec.  73.1620(a)(1).  All of the following conditions also must be met before a station may  apply pursuant to this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The station may not be a ``grandfathered'' short-spaced station  authorized pursuant to Sec.  73.213 or short-spaced by a granted waiver  of Sec.  73.207;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the station is located in or near a radio quiet zone, radio  coordination zone, or a Commission monitoring station (see Sec.  73.1030  and Sec.  0.121(c) of this chapter), the licensee or permittee must have  secured written concurrence from the affected radio quiet zone, radio  coordination zone, or the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland  Security Bureau in the case of a monitoring station, to increase  effective radiated power PRIOR to implementation. A copy of that  concurrence must be submitted with the license application to document  that concurrence has been received;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The station does not require international coordination as the  station does not lie within the border zones, or clearance has been  obtained from Canada or Mexico for the higher power operation within the  station's specified domestic class and the station complies with Sec.   73.207(b)(2) and (3) with respect to foreign allotments and allocations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The increased ERP will not cause the station to violate the  multiple ownership requirements of Sec.  73.3555.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> FM commercial stations and FM noncommercial educational stations  may decrease ERP on a modification of license application provided that  exhibits are included to demonstrate that all six of the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial FM stations must continue to provide a 70 dBu  principal community contour over the community of license, as required  by Sec.  73.315(a). Noncommercial educational FM stations must continue  to provide a 60 dBu contour over at least a portion of the community of  license.
