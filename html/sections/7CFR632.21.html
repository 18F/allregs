In areas not served by conservation districts, the land use compatibility review may be performed by the local reclamation committee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If reclamation plans include lands within or adjacent to Federal lands, the plan is to be reviewed with the appropriate Federal land management agency to insure that the planned land use is compatible with that of the surrounding area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Land users are responsible for insuring that the proposed land use and treatment is compatible with local land use ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Approval.
