                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Beneficiary engaged in noncovered remunerative activity; report by beneficiary. Any individual entitled to a benefit which is subject to a deduction in that month because of noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States (see Sec. 404.417) shall report the occurrence of such an event to the Social Security Administration before the receipt and acceptance of a benefit for the second month following the month in which such event occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beneficiary receiving wife's, husband's, mother's or father's insurance benefits does not have care of a child; report by beneficiary. Any person receiving wife's, husband's, mother's, or father's insurance benefits which are subject to a deduction (as described in Sec. 404.421) because he or she did not have a child in his or her care shall report the occurrence of such an event to the Social Security Administration before the receipt and acceptance of a benefit for the second month following the month in which the deduction event occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Report required by person receiving benefits on behalf of another. Where a person is receiving benefits on behalf of a beneficiary (see subpart U of this part) it is his duty to make the report to the Administration required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, on behalf of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Report; content and form. A report required under the provisions of this section shall be filed with the Social Security Administration. (See Sec. 404.614 of this part for procedures concerning place of filing and date of receipt of such a report.) The report should be made on a form prescribed by the Administration and in accordance with instructions, printed thereon or attached thereto, as prescribed by the Administration. Prescribed forms may be obtained at any office of the Administration. If the prescribed form is not used, the report should be properly identified (e.g., show the name and social security claim number of the beneficiary about whom the report is made), describe the events being reported, tell when the events occurred, furnish any other pertinent data (e.g., who has care of the children), and be properly authenticated (e.g., bear the signature and address of the beneficiary making the report or the person reporting on his behalf). The report should contain all the information needed for a proper determination of whether a deduction applies and, if it does, the period for which such deductions should be made.
