Filing fees will not be charged relative to any filings or submissions of materials made with the FDIC pursuant to the cross reference to regulations of the SEC issued under sections 10A(m), 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78), sections 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7261, 7262, 7264, and 7265), and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electronic filings. (1) The FDIC does not participate in the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval) electronic filing program (17 CFR part 232). The FDIC permits voluntary electronically transmitted filings and submissions of correspondence and other materials in electronic format to the FDIC, with the exception of Beneficial Ownership Reports (Forms 3, 4, and 5) for which electronic filing is mandatory. Beneficial Ownership Report filing requirements are provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC does not participate in the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval) electronic filing program (17 CFR part 232). The FDIC permits voluntary electronically transmitted filings and submissions of correspondence and other materials in electronic format to the FDIC, with the exception of Beneficial Ownership Reports (Forms 3, 4, and 5) for which electronic filing is mandatory. Beneficial Ownership Report filing requirements are provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All reporting persons must electronically file Beneficial Ownership Reports (FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5), including amendments and exhibits thereto, using the Internet-based interagency Beneficial Ownership Filings System, except that a reporting person that has obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the forms with the FDIC in paper format. For electronic filing purposes, FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5 are accessible at the Internet-based interagency Web site for Beneficial Ownership Filings at FDICconnect at https://www2.fdicconnect.gov/index.asp. These forms and the instructions thereto are available for printing and downloading at http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/forms. A reporting person that has obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the appropriate forms with the FDIC in paper format. Instructions for continuing hardship exemptions are provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic filings of FDIC beneficial ownership report Forms 3, 4, and 5 must be submitted to the FDIC through the interagency Beneficial Ownership Filings system.

Business days include each day, except Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays. All filings submitted electronically to the FDIC commencing after 10 p.m. Eastern Time on business days shall be deemed filed as of 8 a.m. on the following business day. All filings submitted electronically to the FDIC on non-business days shall be deemed filed as of 8 a.m. on the following business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustment of the filing date. If an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a beneficial ownership report with the FDIC in a timely manner but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request an adjustment of the filing date of such submission. The FDIC may grant the request if it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exhibits. (i) Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been filed with the FDIC shall be filed in electronic format, absent a hardship exemption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been filed with the FDIC shall be filed in electronic format, absent a hardship exemption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Previously filed exhibits, whether in paper or electronic format, may be incorporated by reference into an electronic filing to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules under the Exchange Act. An electronic filer may, at its option, restate in electronic format an exhibit incorporated by reference that originally was filed in paper format.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any document filed in paper format in violation of mandated electronic filing requirements shall not be incorporated by reference into an electronic filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Continuing Hardship Exemption.

Such document shall be executed before or at the time the electronic filing is made and shall be retained by the filer for a period of five years. Upon request, an electronic filer shall furnish to the FDIC a copy of any or all documents retained pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where the FDIC's rules require a filer to furnish a national securities exchange, a national securities association, a bank, or State savings association, paper copies of a document filed with the FDIC in electronic format, signatures to such paper copies may be in typed form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Legal proceedings.
