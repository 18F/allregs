                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Steps in evaluating disability. We consider all relevant  evidence in your case record when we make a determination or decision  whether you are disabled. If you allege more than one impairment, we  will evaluate all the impairments for which we have evidence. Thus, we  will consider the combined effects of all your impairments   upon your overall health and functioning. We will also evaluate any  limitations in your functioning that result from your symptoms,  including pain (see Sec. 416.929). We will also consider all of the  relevant factors in Secs. 416.924a and 416.924b whenever we assess your  functioning at any step of this process. We follow a set order to  determine whether you are disabled. If you are doing substantial gainful  activity, we will determine that you are not disabled and not review  your claim further. If you are not doing substantial gainful activity,  we will consider your physical or mental impairment(s) first to see if  you have an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe. If  your impairment(s) is not severe, we will determine that you are not  disabled and not review your claim further. If your impairment(s) is  severe, we will review your claim further to see if you have an  impairment(s) that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the  listings. If you have such an impairment(s), and it meets the duration  requirement, we will find that you are disabled. If you do not have such  an impairment(s), or if it does not meet the duration requirement, we  will find that you are not disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If you are working. If you are working and the work you are  doing is substantial gainful activity, we will find that you are not  disabled regardless of your medical condition or age, education, or work  experience. (For our rules on how we decide whether you are engaging in  substantial gainful activity, see Secs. 416.971 through 416.976.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You must have a medically determinable impairment(s) that is  severe. If you do not have a medically determinable impairment, or your  impairment(s) is a slight abnormality or a combination of slight  abnormalities that causes no more than minimal functional limitations,  we will find that you do not have a severe impairment(s) and are,  therefore, not disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Your impairment(s) must meet, medically equal, or functionally  equal the listings. An impairment(s) causes marked and severe functional  limitations if it meets or medically equals the severity of a set of  criteria for an impairment in the listings, or if it functionally equals  the listings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Therefore, if you have an impairment(s) that meets or medically  equals the requirements of a listing or that functionally equals the  listings, and that meets the duration requirement, we will find you  disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If your impairment(s) does not meet the duration requirement, or  does not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal the listings, we  will find that you are not disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other rules. We explain other rules for evaluating impairments  at all steps of this process in Secs. 416.924a, 416.924b, and 416.929.  We explain our rules for deciding whether an impairment(s) meets a  listing in Sec. 416.925. Our rules for how we decide whether an  impairment(s) medically equals a listing are in Sec. 416.926. Our rules  for deciding whether an impairment(s) functionally equals the listings  are in Sec. 416.926a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If you attain age 18 after you file your disability application  but before we make a determination or decision. For the period during  which you are under age 18, we will use the rules in this section. For  the period starting with the day you attain age 18, we will use the  disability rules we use for adults who file new claims, in Sec. 416.920.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> How we will explain our findings. When we make a determination  or decision whether you are disabled under this section or whether your  disability continues under Sec. 416.994a, we will indicate our findings  at each step of the sequential evaluation process as we explain in this  paragraph. At the initial and reconsideration levels of the  administrative review process, State agency medical and psychological  consultants will indicate their findings in writing in a manner that we  prescribe. The State agency medical or psychological consultant (see  Sec. 416.1016) or other designee of the Commissioner has overall  responsibility for completing the prescribed writing and must sign the  prescribed writing to attest that it is complete, including the findings  of fact and any discussion of supporting evidence. Disability hearing  officers, administrative law judges and the administrative appeals  judges on the Appeals Council (when the Appeals Council makes a  decision) will indicate   their findings at each step of the sequential evaluation process in  their determinations or decisions. In claims adjudicated under the  procedures in part 405 of this chapter, administrative law judges will  also indicate their findings at each step of the sequential evaluation  process in their decisions.  [58 FR 47577, Sept. 9, 1993, as amended at 62 FR 6421, Feb. 11, 1997; 65  FR 54778, Sept. 11, 2000; 71 FR 16460, Mar. 31, 2006; 76 FR 24811, May  3, 2011; 76 FR 41687, July 15, 2011]    Sec. 416.924a  Considerations in determining disability for children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, such as physical,  occupational, and rehabilitation therapists; and nonmedical sources,  such as your parents, teachers, and other people who know you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Medical evidence--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Medical evidence of your  impairment(s) must describe symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings.  The medical evidence may include, but is not limited to, formal testing  that provides information about your development or functioning in terms  of standard deviations, percentiles, percentages of delay, or age or  grade equivalents. It may also include opinions from medical sources  about the nature and severity of your impairments. (See Sec. 416.927.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test scores. We consider all of the relevant information in  your case record and will not consider any single piece of evidence in  isolation. Therefore, we will not rely on test scores alone when we  decide whether you are disabled. (See Sec. 416.926a(e) for more  information about how we consider test scores.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medical sources. Medical sources will report their findings  and observations on clinical examination and the results of any formal  testing. A medical source's report should note and resolve any material  inconsistencies between formal test results, other medical findings, and  your usual functioning. Whenever possible and appropriate, the  interpretation of findings by the medical source should reflect  consideration of information from your parents or other people who know  you, including your teachers and therapists. When a medical source has  accepted and relied on such information to reach a diagnosis, we may  consider this information to be a clinical sign, as defined in  Sec. 416.928(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information from other people. Every child is unique, so the  effects of your impairment(s) on your functioning may be very different  from the effects the same impairment(s) might have on another child.  Therefore, whenever possible and appropriate, we will try to get  information from people who can tell us about the effects of your  impairment(s) on your activities and how you function on a day-to-day  basis. These other people may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Your parents and other caregivers. Your parents and other  caregivers can be important sources of information because they usually  see you every day. In addition to your parents, other caregivers may  include a childcare provider who takes care of you while your parent(s)  works or an adult who looks after you in a before-or after-school  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Early intervention and preschool programs. If you have been  identified for early intervention services (in your home or elsewhere)  because of your impairment(s), or if you attend a preschool program  (e.g., Headstart or a public school kindergarten for children with  special needs), these programs are also important sources of information  about your functioning. We will ask for reports from the agency and  individuals who provide you with services or from your teachers about  how you typically function compared to other children your age who do  not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> School. If you go to school, we will ask for information from  your teachers and other school personnel about how you are functioning  there on a day-to-day basis compared to other children your age who do  not have impairments. We will ask for any reports that the school may  have that show   the results of formal testing or that describe any special education  instruction or services, including home-based instruction, or any  accommodations provided in a regular classroom.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Factors we consider when we evaluate the effects of your  impairment(s) on your functioning--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. We must consider your  functioning when we decide whether your impairment(s) is ``severe'' and  when we decide whether your impairment(s) functionally equals the  listings. We will also consider your functioning when we decide whether  your impairment(s) meets or medically equals a listing if the listing we  are considering includes functioning among its criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Factors we consider when we evaluate your functioning. Your  limitations in functioning must result from your medically determinable  impairment(s). The information we get from your medical and nonmedical  sources can help us understand how your impairment(s) affects your  functioning. We will also consider any factors that are relevant to how  you function when we evaluate your impairment or combination of  impairments. For example, your symptoms (such as pain, fatigue,  decreased energy, or anxiety) may limit your functioning. (See  Sec. 416.929.) We explain some other factors we may consider when we  evaluate your functioning in paragraphs (b)(3)-(b)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> How your functioning compares to the functioning of children  your age who do not have impairments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. When we evaluate your  functioning, we will look at whether you do the things that other  children your age typically do or whether you have limitations and  restrictions because of your medically determinable impairment(s). We  will also look at how well you do the activities and how much help you  need from your family, teachers, or others. Information about what you  can and cannot do, and how you function on a day-to-day basis at home,  school, and in the community, allows us to compare your activities to  the activities of children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> How we will consider reports of your functioning. When we  consider the evidence in your case record about the quality of your  activities, we will consider the standards used by the person who gave  us the information. We will also consider the characteristics of the  group to whom you are being compared. For example, if the way you do  your classwork is compared to other children in a special education  class, we will consider that you are being compared to children who do  have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combined effects of multiple impairments. If you have more than  one impairment, we will sometimes be able to decide that you have a  ``severe'' impairment or an impairment that meets, medically equals, or  functionally equals the listings by looking at each of your impairments  separately. When we cannot, we will look comprehensively at the combined  effects of your impairments on your day-to-day functioning instead of  considering the limitations resulting from each impairment separately.  (See Secs. 416.923 and 416.926a(c) for more information about how we  will consider the interactive and cumulative effects of your impairments  on your functioning.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> How well you can initiate, sustain, and complete your  activities, including the amount of help or adaptations you need, and  the effects of structured or supportive settings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initiating,  sustaining, and completing activities. We will consider how effectively  you function by examining how independently you are able to initiate,  sustain, and complete your activities despite your impairment(s),  compared to other children your age who do not have impairments. We will  consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The range of activities you do;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Your ability to do them independently, including any prompting  you may need to begin, carry through, and complete your activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The pace at which you do your activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> How much effort you need to make to do your activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> How long you are able to sustain your activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extra help. We will consider how independently you are able to  function compared to other children your age who do not have  impairments. We will consider whether you need help from other people,  or whether you need special equipment, devices, or medications to  perform your day-to-day activities.   For example, we may consider how much supervision you need to keep from  hurting yourself, how much help you need every day to get dressed or, if  you are an infant, how long it takes for your parents or other  caregivers to feed you. We recognize that children are often able to do  things and complete tasks when given help, but may not be able to do  these same things by themselves. Therefore, we will consider how much  extra help you need, what special equipment or devices you use, and the  medications you take that enable you to participate in activities like  other children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adaptations. We will consider the nature and extent of any  adaptations that you use to enable you to function. Such adaptations may  include assistive devices or appliances. Some adaptations may enable you  to function normally or almost normally (e.g., eyeglasses). Others may  increase your functioning, even though you may still have functional  limitations (e.g., ankle-foot orthoses, hand or foot splints, and  specially adapted or custom-made tools, utensils, or devices for self- care activities such as bathing, feeding, toileting, and dressing). When  we evaluate your functioning with an adaptation, we will consider the  degree to which the adaptation enables you to function compared to other  children your age who do not have impairments, your ability to use the  adaptation effectively on a sustained basis, and any functional  limitations that nevertheless persist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Structured or supportive settings. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you have a serious  impairment(s), you may spend some or all of your time in a structured or  supportive setting, beyond what a child who does not have an impairment  typically needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A structured or supportive setting may be your own home in which  family members or other people (e.g., visiting nurses or home health  workers) make adjustments to accommodate your impairment(s). A  structured or supportive setting may also be your classroom at school,  whether it is a regular classroom in which you are accommodated or a  special classroom. It may also be a residential facility or school where  you live for a period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A structured or supportive setting may minimize signs and  symptoms of your impairment(s) and help to improve your functioning  while you are in it, but your signs, symptoms, and functional  limitations may worsen outside this type of setting. Therefore, we will  consider your need for a structured setting and the degree of limitation  in functioning you have or would have outside the structured setting.  Even if you are able to function adequately in the structured or  supportive setting, we must consider how you function in other settings  and whether you would continue to function at an adequate level without  the structured or supportive setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If you have a chronic impairment(s), you may have your  activities structured in such a way as to minimize stress and reduce the  symptoms or signs of your impairment(s). You may continue to have  persistent pain, fatigue, decreased energy, or other symptoms or signs,  although at a lesser level of severity. We will consider whether you are  more limited in your functioning than your symptoms and signs would  indicate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Therefore, if your symptoms or signs are controlled or reduced  in a structured setting, we will consider how well you are functioning  in the setting and the nature of the setting in which you are  functioning (e.g., home or a special class); the amount of help you need  from your parents, teachers, or others to function as well as you do;  adjustments you make to structure your environment; and how you would  function without the structured or supportive setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Unusual settings. Children may function differently in  unfamiliar or one-to-one settings than they do in their usual settings  at home, at school, in childcare or in the community. You may appear  more or less impaired on a single examination (such as a consultative  examination) than indicated by the information covering a longer period.  Therefore, we will apply the guidance in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section when we consider how you function in an unusual or one-to-one  situation. We   will look at your performance in a special situation and at your typical  day-to-day functioning in routine situations. We will not draw  inferences about your functioning in other situations based only on how  you function in a one-to-one, new, or unusual situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Early intervention and school programs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. If you are  a very young child who has been identified for early intervention  services, or if you attend school (including preschool), the records of  people who know you or who have examined you are important sources of  information about your impairment(s) and its effects on your  functioning. Records from physicians, teachers and school psychologists,  or physical, occupational, or speech-language therapists are examples of  what we will consider. If you receive early intervention services or go  to school or preschool, we will consider this information when it is  relevant and available to us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> School evidence. If you go to school or preschool, we will ask  your teacher(s) about your performance in your activities throughout  your school day. We will consider all the evidence we receive from your  school, including teacher questionnaires, teacher checklists, group  achievement testing, and report cards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Early intervention and special education programs. If you have  received a comprehensive assessment for early intervention services or  special education services, we will consider information used by the  assessment team to make its recommendations. We will consider the  information in your Individualized Family Service Plan, your  Individualized Education Program, or your plan for transition services  to help us understand your functioning. We will examine the goals and  objectives of your plan or program as further indicators of your  functioning, as well as statements regarding related services,  supplementary aids, program modifications, and other accommodations  recommended to help you function, together with the other relevant  information in your case record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special education or accommodations. We will consider the fact  that you attend school, that you may be placed in a special education  setting, or that you receive accommodations because of your impairments  along with the other information in your case record. The fact that you  attend school does not mean that you are not disabled. The fact that you  do or do not receive special education services does not, in itself,  establish your actual limitations or abilities. Children are placed in  special education settings, or are included in regular classrooms (with  or without accommodation), for many reasons that may or may not be  related to the level of their impairments. For example, you may receive  one-to-one assistance from an aide throughout the day in a regular  classroom, or be placed in a special classroom. We will consider the  circumstances of your school attendance, such as your ability to  function in a regular classroom or preschool setting with children your  age who do not have impairments. Similarly, we will consider that good  performance in a special education setting does not mean that you are  functioning at the same level as other children your age who do not have  impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Attendance and participation. We will also consider factors  affecting your ability to participate in your education program. You may  be unable to participate on a regular basis because of the chronic or  episodic nature of your impairment(s) or your need for therapy or  treatment. If you have more than one impairment, we will look at whether  the effects of your impairments taken together make you unable to  participate on a regular basis. We will consider how your temporary  removal or absence from the program affects your ability to function  compared to other children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The impact of chronic illness and limitations that interfere  with your activities over time. If you have a chronic impairment(s) that  is characterized by episodes of exacerbation (worsening) and remission  (improvement), we will consider the frequency and severity of your  episodes of exacerbation as factors that may be limiting your  functioning. Your level of functioning may vary considerably over time.  Proper evaluation of your ability to function   in any domain requires us to take into account any variations in your  level of functioning to determine the impact of your chronic illness on  your ability to function over time. If you require frequent treatment,  we will consider it as explained in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The effects of treatment (including medications and other  treatment). We will evaluate the effects of your treatment to determine  its effect on your functioning in your particular case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effects of medications. We will consider the effects of  medication on your symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and  functioning. Although medications may control the most obvious  manifestations of your impairment(s), they may or may not affect the  functional limitations imposed by your impairment(s). If your symptoms  or signs are reduced by medications, we will consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any of your functional limitations that may nevertheless  persist, even if there is improvement from the medications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether your medications create any side effects that cause or  contribute to your functional limitations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The frequency of your need for medication;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Changes in your medication or the way your medication is  prescribed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any evidence over time of how medication helps or does not help  you to function compared to other children your age who do not have  impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other treatment. We will also consider the level and frequency  of treatment other than medications that you get for your impairment(s).  You may need frequent and ongoing therapy from one or more medical  sources to maintain or improve your functional status. (Examples of  therapy include occupational, physical, or speech and language therapy,  nursing or home health services, psychotherapy, or psychosocial  counseling.) Frequent therapy, although intended to improve your  functioning in some ways, may also interfere with your functioning in  other ways. Therefore, we will consider the frequency of any therapy you  must have, and how long you have received or will need it. We will also  consider whether the therapy interferes with your participation in  activities typical of other children your age who do not have  impairments, such as attending school or classes and socializing with  your peers. If you must frequently interrupt your activities at school  or at home for therapy, we will consider whether these interruptions  interfere with your functioning. We will also consider the length and  frequency of your hospitalizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment and intervention, in general. With treatment or  intervention, you may not only have your symptoms or signs reduced, but  may also maintain, return to, or achieve a level of functioning that is  not disabling. Treatment or intervention may prevent, eliminate, or  reduce functional limitations.  [65 FR 54779, Sept. 11, 2000]    Sec. 416.924b  Age as a factor of evaluation in the sequential evaluation process for children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. In this section, we explain how we consider age when we  decide whether you are disabled. Your age may or may not be a factor in  our determination whether your impairment(s) meets or medically equals a  listing, depending on the listing we use for comparison. However, your  age is an important factor when we decide whether your impairment(s) is  severe (see Sec. 416.924(c)) and whether it functionally equals the  listings (see Sec. 416.926a). Except in the case of certain premature  infants, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, age means  chronological age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When we determine whether you have an impairment or combination  of impairments that is severe, we will compare your functioning to that  of children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When we determine whether your impairment(s) meets a listing, we  may or may not need to consider your age. The listings describe  impairments that we consider of such significance that they are presumed  to cause marked and severe functional limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the listing appropriate for evaluating your impairment is  divided into specific age categories, we will evaluate your impairment  according to your   age when we decide whether your impairment meets that listing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the listing appropriate for evaluating your impairment does  not include specific age categories, we will decide whether your  impairment meets the listing without giving consideration to your age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When we compare an unlisted impairment or a combination of  impairments with the listings to determine whether it medically equals  the severity of a listing, the way we consider your age will depend on  the listing we use for comparison. We will use the same principles for  considering your age as in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this  section; that is, we will consider your age only if we are comparing  your impairment(s) to a listing that includes specific age categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> We will also consider your age and whether it affects your  ability to be tested. If your impairment(s) is not amenable to formal  testing because of your age, we will consider all information in your  case record that helps us decide whether you are disabled. We will  consider other generally acceptable methods consistent with the  prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice that will  help us evaluate the existence and severity of your impairment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Correcting chronological age of premature infants. We generally  use chronological age (that is, a child's age based on birth date) when  we decide whether, or the extent to which, a physical or mental  impairment or combination of impairments causes functional limitations.  However, if you were born prematurely, we may consider you to be younger  than your chronological age. When we evaluate the development or linear  growth of a child born prematurely, we may use a ``corrected''  chronological age; that is, the chronological age adjusted by a period  of gestational prematurity. We consider an infant born at less than 37  weeks' gestation to be born prematurely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We apply a corrected chronological age in these situations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When we evaluate developmental delay in premature children until  the child's prematurity is no longer a relevant factor; generally no  later than about chronological age 2 (see paragraph (b)(2) of this  section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When we evaluate an impairment of linear growth, such as under  the listings in Sec. 100.00 in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of  this chapter, until the child is 12 months old. In this situation, we  refer to neonatal growth charts which have been developed to evaluate  growth in premature infants (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> We compute a corrected chronological age as follows--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If you have not attained age 1, we will correct your  chronological age. We compute the corrected chronological age by  subtracting the number of weeks of prematurity (i.e., the difference  between 40 weeks of full-term gestation and the number of actual weeks  of gestation) from your chronological age. The result is your corrected  chronological age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you are over age 1, have a developmental delay, and  prematurity is still a relevant factor in your case (generally, no later  than about chronological age 2), we will decide whether to correct your  chronological age. Our decision will be based on our judgment and all  the facts of your case. If we decide to correct your chronological age,  we may correct it by subtracting the full number of weeks of prematurity  or a lesser number of weeks. We will also decide not to correct your  chronological age if we can determine from the evidence that your  developmental delay is the result of your medically determinable  impairment(s) and is not attributable to your prematurity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, we will not compute a corrected chronological age if the  medical evidence shows that your treating source or other medical source  has already taken your prematurity into consideration in his or her  assessment of your development. Also, we will not compute a corrected  chronological age when we find you disabled using the examples of  functional equivalence based on low birth weight in Sec. 416.926a(m)(6)  or (7).
