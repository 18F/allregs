                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. CMS may impose a directed plan of correction as an  alternative sanction for any laboratory that has condition level  deficiencies. If CMS does not impose a directed plan of correction as an  alternative sanction for a laboratory that has condition level  deficiencies, it at least imposes a directed portion of a plan of  correction when it imposes any of the following alternative sanctions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State onsite monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civil money penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Suspension of all or part of Medicare payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directed plan of correction. When imposing this  sanction, CMS--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gives the laboratory prior notice of the sanction and  opportunity to respond in accordance with Sec. 493.1810;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Directs the laboratory to take specific corrective action  within specific time frames in order to achieve compliance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May direct the laboratory to submit the names of laboratory  clients for notification purposes, as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Directed portion of a plan of correction. CMS may decide to  notify clients   of a sanctioned laboratory, because of the seriousness of the  noncompliance (e.g., the existence of immediate jeopardy) or for other  reasons. When imposing this sanction, CMS takes the following steps--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directs the laboratory to submit to CMS, the State survey  agency, or other CMS agent, within 10 calendar days after the notice of  the alternative sanction, a list of names and addresses of all  physicians, providers, suppliers, and other clients who have used some  or all of the services of the laboratory since the last certification  inspection or within any other timeframe specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the information, may send  to each laboratory client, via the State survey agency, a notice  containing the name and address of the laboratory, the nature of the  laboratory's noncompliance, and the kind and effective date of the  alternative sanction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sends to each laboratory client, via the State survey agency,  notice of the recission of an adverse action within 30 days of the  rescission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice of imposition of a principal sanction following the  imposition of an alternative sanction. If CMS imposes a principal  sanction following the imposition of an alternative sanction, and for  which CMS has already obtained a list of laboratory clients, CMS may use  that list to notify the clients of the imposition of the principal  sanction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of a directed plan of correction. If CMS imposes a  directed plan of correction, and on revisit it is found that the  laboratory has not corrected the deficiencies within 12 months from the  last day of inspection, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS cancels the laboratory's approval for Medicare payment of  its services, and notifies the laboratory of CMS's intent to suspend,  limit, or revoke the laboratory's CLIA certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The directed plan of correction continues in effect until the  day suspension, limitation, or revocation of the laboratory's CLIA  certificate.</p>
