                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The preparation of an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) is required once every 5 years, in accordance with 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180. PHAs have three options in meeting their AFH requirements. PHAs must notify HUD of the option they choose. The options are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Option 1: Assessment of Fair Housing with Units of General Local Government or State Governmental Agencies. (i) A PHA may work with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A PHA must choose the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the PHA serves residents of two or more jurisdictions, the PHA may choose the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has preexisting obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must work with the general unit of local government named in the Agreement or Decree, when preparing the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A PHA working with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH will have fulfilled the requirements of AFH submission when the general unit of local government or State governmental agency submits an AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the unit of general local government or state governmental agency's AFH is accepted, all PHAs working with the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH will be covered by the applicable goals contained in the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a PHA joins with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of an AFH, the PHA must ensure that its PHA Plan is consistent with the general unit of local government's or State governmental agency's applicable consolidated plan and its AFH. (See also 24 CFR 5.158 for coordination when preparing an AFH jointly with a jurisdiction.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> PHAs are encouraged to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with units of general local government, State governmental agencies, and other PHAs to clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process of the program participants in the creation of the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Option 2: Assessment of Fair Housing with Public Housing Agencies. (i) A PHA may jointly participate with one or more PHAs in the planning, participation, and preparation of the AFH consistent with the requirements of 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, and with the geographic scope and proposed actions scaled to the PHAs' operations and region, as provided in Sec. 5.154.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> PHAs preparing a joint submission of an AFH are encouraged to prepare MOUs or other such cooperative agreements, which clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process for the jointly participating PHAs. The MOU or cooperative agreement should also clearly indicate a lead agency that will submit on behalf of the joint participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An accepted AFH submitted on behalf of jointly participating PHAs will fulfill the submission requirements for all entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If jointly participating PHAs' AFH is accepted, all PHAs participating in the creation of the AFH will be covered by the applicable goals contained in the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a PHA joins with other PHAs in the submission of an AFH, the PHA must ensure that its 5-year PHA Plan is consistent with the AFH and its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A PHA that is jointly participating with other PHAs in the creation of an AFH must certify consistency with the consolidated plan of the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions. If a PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The PHA may choose to certify consistency with the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has pre-existing obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must certify consistency with the general unit of local government named in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement or Consent Decree, when preparing the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the event that HUD accepts an AFH under this option, and such AFH conflicts with the accepted AFH conducted by the unit of general local government or State governmental agency, a PHA's certification of consistency with the consolidated plan shall be accepted as a certification of consistency with the consolidated plan for all actions that do not directly conflict with the PHA's AFH that has been accepted by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Option 3: Independent PHA Assessment of Fair Housing. (i) A PHA may conduct its own AFH with geographic scope and proposed actions scaled to the PHA's operations and region, in accordance with 24 CFR 5.154(d). An accepted AFH submitted by a PHA performing an independent AFH will fulfill the submission requirements for that PHA and the PHA shall be covered by the goals contained in the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A PHA that is performing its own AFH must certify consistency with the consolidated plan of the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions. If a PHA's service area is in two or more jurisdictions then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The PHA may choose to certify consistency with the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has pre-existing obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must certify consistency with the general unit of local government named in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement or Consent Decree, when preparing the AFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event that HUD accepts an AFH under this option, and such AFH conflicts with the AFH conducted by the unit of general local government or State governmental agency, the PHA's certification of consistency with the consolidated plan shall be accepted as a certification of consistency with the consolidated plan for all actions that do not directly conflict with the PHA's AFH that has been accepted by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> PHAs may but are not required to request a change in their fiscal years

to better coordinate their planning cycle with the planning performed under each of the options listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a material change in circumstances occurs in the jurisdiction of a PHA that requires a revision to the AFH, as specified in 24 CFR 5.164, the PHA will have up to 12 months to incorporate any goals from the revised AFH into its 5-Year PHA Plan, in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR 903.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fair housing requirements. A PHA is obligated to affirmatively further fair housing in its operating policies, procedures, and capital activities. All admission and occupancy policies for public housing and Section 8 tenant-based housing programs must comply with Fair Housing Act requirements and other civil rights laws and regulations and with a PHA's plans to affirmatively further fair housing. The PHA may not impose any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nondiscrimination. A PHA must carry out its PHA Plan in conformity with the nondiscrimination requirements in Federal civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Fair Housing Act. A PHA may not assign housing to persons in a particular section of a community or to a development or building based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin for purposes of segregating populations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. A PHA's policies should be designed to reduce the concentration of tenants and other assisted persons by race, national origin, and disability in conformity with any applicable Assessment of Fair Housing as defined at 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180 and the PHA's assessment of its fair housing needs. Any affirmative steps or incentives a PHA plans to take must be stated in the admission policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> HUD regulations provide that PHAs must take steps to affirmatively further fair housing. PHA policies should include affirmative steps to overcome the effects of discrimination and the effects of conditions that resulted in limiting participation of persons because of their race, national origin, disability, or other protected class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such affirmative steps may include, but are not limited to, marketing efforts, use of nondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment policies that lead to desegregation, additional applicant consultation and information, provision of additional supportive services and amenities to a development (such as supportive services that enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community), and engagement in ongoing coordination with state and local disability agencies to provide additional community-based housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities and to connect such individuals with supportive services to enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Validity of certification. (i) A PHA's certification under Sec. 903.7(o) will be subject to challenge by HUD where it appears that a PHA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Fails to meet the affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements at 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, including failure to take meaningful actions to further the goals identified in the AFH; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Takes action that is materially inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Fails to meet the fair housing, civil rights, and affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements in 24 CFR 903.7(o).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If HUD challenges the validity of a PHA's certification, HUD will do so in writing specifying the deficiencies, and will give the PHA an opportunity to respond to the particular challenge in writing. In responding to the specified deficiencies, a PHA must establish, as applicable, that it has complied with fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, or has remedied violations of fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, and has adopted policies and undertaken actions to affirmatively further fair housing, including, but not limited to, providing a full

range of housing opportunities to applicants and tenants and taking affirmative steps as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in a nondiscriminatory manner. In responding to the PHA, HUD may accept the PHA's explanation and withdraw the challenge, undertake further investigation, or pursue other remedies available under law. HUD will seek to obtain voluntary corrective action consistent with the specified deficiencies. In determining whether a PHA has complied with its certification, HUD will review the PHA's circumstances relevant to the specified deficiencies, including characteristics of the population served by the PHA; characteristics of the PHA's existing housing stock; and decisions, plans, goals, priorities, strategies, and actions of the PHA, including those designed to affirmatively further fair housing.
