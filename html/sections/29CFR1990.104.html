The Secretary shall request that the panel submit a  report of its evaluation within ninety (90) days after the appointment  of the members of the panel. The Secretary shall place a copy of the  report in the record of any relevant rulemaking undertaken pursuant to  this part and allow an appropriate time for public review and comment.  If a panel is not established or fails to file a timely report, or if  the Secretary determines that it is necessary to proceed without waiting  for the panel's report, the Secretary may proceed in making any  determination without such report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other aid and assistance.
