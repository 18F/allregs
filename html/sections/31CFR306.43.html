                            <p class="depth0">An assignment of a security to or for the account of another person, not completed by delivery, may be voided by a disclaimer of interest from that person. This disclaimer should be executed in the presence of an officer authorized to certify assignments of securities. Unless otherwise authorized by the Bureau, the disclaimer must be written, typed, or stamped on the back of the security in substantially the following form:</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned as assignee of this security hereby disclaims any interest herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Signature)</em></p><p class="depth0">I certify that the above-named person as described, whose identity is well known or proved to me, personally appeared before me the ------ day of ------------ (Month and year) at -------------------- (Place) and signed the above disclaimer of interest.(seal)__________________________________________________________________(Signature and official designation of certifying officer)

In the absence of a disclaimer, an affidavit or affidavits should be submitted for consideration explaining why a disclaimer cannot be obtained, reciting all other material facts and circumstances relating to the transaction, including whether or not the security was delivered to the person named as assignee and whether or not the affiants know of any basis for the assignee claiming any right, title, or interest in the security. After an assignment has been voided, in order to dispose of the security, an assignment by or on behalf of the owner will be required.
