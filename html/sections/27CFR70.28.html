Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2), a summons issued solely to determine the identity of a person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement) with a bank or other institution is excepted from the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609. A ``numbered account (or similar arrangement)'' under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2) is an account through which a person may authorize transactions solely through the use of a number, symbol, code name, or other device not involving the disclosure of the person's identity. A ``person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement)'' includes the person who opened the account and any person authorized to use the account or to receive records or statements concerning it.
