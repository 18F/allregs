                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section defines: Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion  in the calculation of avoidable costs; the conditions under which  certain cost elements become eligible for inclusion; and the basis of  apportioning those cost elements which are not assigned to the branch on  an actual expense basis. The avoidable costs of providing freight  service on a branch shall be the total of the costs assigned to the  branch in accordance with this section. The avoidable costs of providing  freight service on a branch shall be just and reasonable, and shall not  exceed   those necessary for an honest and efficient operation. Those expenses  apportioned under this section shall be derived from the latest Form R-1  Annual Report for Class I railroads filed with the Board prior to the  conclusion of the subsidy year, and company records for all non-Class I  railroads, and assigned to the branch according to the procedures set  forth in Sec.  1152.33 of these regulations. When the term ``Actual'' is  specified as the basis for assigning an expense, it shall mean that the  only costs which can be assigned to the account are those costs which  are incurred solely as a result of the continuation of rail freight  service on the branch. The accounts in the following charts, which list  only the ``freight-only'' account numbers, shall include the portion of  common expenses that have been apportioned to freight service.

Freight car costs shall not include  depreciation as determined in Account No. 62-22-00. Freight car  depreciation shall be calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph  (g)(3)(i) of this section. The system total receipts and payments for  the hire of time-mileage cars, and the basic data used in the  development of the car-day and car-mile factors, shall be taken from the  carrier's latest Form R-1 and company records. The specific steps to  complete the calculation are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Averaging the carrier's freight car ownership at the beginning  and end of the year (Form R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiplying the average by the standard active number of car  days (346) as developed in ICC Docket No. 31358;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subtracting car days on foreign lines (source: Company  records); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adding the foreign car days on home line (source: Company  records). This procedure shall be followed for each car type specified  in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the  loaded car miles for the railroad owned and leased cars (R-1, Schedule  755) to empty car miles for the railroad owned or leased cars (R-1,  Schedule 755). The total car miles, loaded and empty, shall be  calculated for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, supra.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The cost per car day shall be calculated for each type of time- mileage car by adding 50 percent of total freight car repair costs for  each type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b)), and 60 percent of the  depreciation shall be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The current value for each type of car shall be calculated by  first arriving at the current cost per car using the most recent  purchase of this type by the railroad indexed to the midpoint of the  year or a price quote from the manufacturer. This unit price shall be  applied to the average number of this type of car owned by the carrier  during the year. The current value developed for each car type is then  multiplied by the composite depreciation rate for that type of car as  shown in the latest annual report filed with the Board or company  records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Add 100 percent of the return on investment. Return on  investment shall be determined by multiplying the current value of each  type of car, developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, by 1  minus the ratio of accumulated depreciation to the total original cost  investment. This will determine the net current value for each type of  car. The net current value for each type of car shall then be multiplied  by the nominal rate of return calculated in Sec.  1152.34(d) to obtain  nominal return on investment for each type of car. The total return on  investment shall then be calculated by deducting the projected holding  gain (loss) for the forecast and/or subsidy year from the nominal return  on investment for each type of car. In any instance where the holding  gain is not specifically determined for freight cars, the Gross Domestic  Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be  used. The total return on investment for each type of car shall then be  divided by total car-days for each car-type developed in paragraph  (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the amounts for repairs and depreciation, add the time  portion of the railroad's payment for hire of time-mileage freight cars  (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (g)), and subtract the time portion of  the railroad's receipts for hire of time mileage freight cars (Form R-1,  schedule 414, column (d)). The total of these costs is divided by the  total car days for each type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time- mileage car as follows. First, add:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 50 percent of the total freight train car repair cost for each  car type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 40 percent of the total depreciation costs for each car type  developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The mileage portion of the carrier's payments for the hire of  time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (f)).   Second, subtract the mileage portion of the carrier's receipts for hire  of time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (c)).  Finally, divide the result by the total car-miles for each car-type  developed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The costs per car day and per car mile developed in paragraphs  (g) (3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car days  and total car miles for each car type accumulated on the line segment  for all traffic originated and/or terminated on the segment plus those  freight cars that bridge the line segment which are attributed to time- mileage freight train cars. The on-segment costs for freight cars rented  on a straight mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for  mileage cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (e)) for each car type  divided by the total miles on which the charges were based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For Class II and III railroads, the on-segment costs for time- mileage and straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the  same manner prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Return on investment--locomotive (line). The return on  investment shall be calculated for each type of classification of  locomotive that is actually used to provide service to the line segment.  The return for the locomotive(s) used shall be calculated in accordance  with the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to  serve the line segment shall be based on the most recent purchase of  that particular type and size locomotive by the carrier, indexed to the  midpoint of the forecast and/or subsidy year, or on an amount quoted by  the manufacturer. The amount must be substantiated. This unit cost shall  be multiplied by 1 minus the ratio of total accumulated depreciation to  original total cost of that type of equipment owned by applicant- carrier, as shown by company records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The current nominal cost of capital shall be used in the  calculation of return on investment for locomotives and shall be  calculated as provided in Sec.  1152.34(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The return on investment for each category or type of locomotive  shall be the nominal return less the holding gain (loss). The nominal  return is calculated by multiplying the replacement cost determined in  paragraph   (h)(1) of this section by the nominal rate of return determined in  paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The holding gain (loss) shall be the  gain (loss) projected to occur during the forecast and/or subsidy year.  In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically determined  for locomotives, the Gross Domestic Product deflator calculated by the  U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The return on investment for each type of locomotive shall be  assigned to the line segment on a ratio of the locomotive unit hours on  the segment to average locomotive unit hours per unit for each type of  locomotive in the system. This ratio will be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The carrier shall keep and maintain records of the number of  hours that each type of locomotive incurred in serving the segment  during the subsidy period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The railroad shall develop the system average locomotive unit  hours per unit for each of the following types of locomotives; yard  diesel; yard-other; road diesel; and road-other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The ratio applied to the return on investment is calculated by  dividing the hours that each type or class of locomotive is used to  serve the segment, as developed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section,  by the system average locomotive unit hours per unit for the applicable  type developed in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The cost assigned to the segment for each type of locomotive  shall be calculated by multiplying the annual return on investment  developed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed  in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revenue taxes. The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed  based on the amounts directly paid in those states that subject the  railroad to a revenue tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Property taxes (Line). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The assigned costs under this  subsection shall be the net systemwide property tax savings resulting  from the abandonment, calculated as set out below, if the applicant- carrier intends subsequently to sell or otherwise dispose of the  abandoned properties. If the applicant-carrier expresses an intent to  dispose of the properties, it will be presumed that the properties will  ultimately be sold or otherwise disposed of after abandonment.  Protestants may rebut this presumption by showing that it would be  financially beneficial to retain ownership of the property for  investment purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In states where a true ad valorem tax is levied on real property  (such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities), applicant must  affirm that the ad valorem method applies and must substantiate the  amount of property taxes levied against the property on the line  segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In states where the ad valorem method is not employed, applicant  must describe the applicable property tax methodology if it is claiming  the local property tax as an avoidable cost of operations. Additionally,  it must substantiate with evidence and computations the actual statewide  tax savings attributable to the abandonment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any property tax properly substantiated under paragraphs (f)(2)  or (3) of this section shall be presumed to represent systemwide savings  to the carrier. Protestants may rebut this presumption by presenting  evidence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That property taxes in those states where the carrier operates  that are not involved in the abandonment will increase significantly  because of reassessments attributable to the abandonment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That a significantly higher property tax will be levied against  a retained portion of the abandoned property. If applicant does not  refute protestant's evidence, it may claim avoidable property taxes only  if, and to the extent, it proves systemwide property tax savings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In states where real property taxes are assessed and levied  against the owner of the property but the tax on rolling stock is  assessed to the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula  of a statewide valuation of property, the tax on rolling stock  attributable to each line segment shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Using ratio of the cost of equipment (as used in the formula) to  the total of all property costs (as used in formula);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Apply that ratio to the total state assessment to determine the  portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each  line segment on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the  segment to total car and locomotive unit miles in the state; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Apply the appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated  assessment thus determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Administrative costs. The costs assigned under this account  shall be the actual costs directly attributable to the administration of  the subsidy program or at the option of the carrier, one percent of the  total annual revenues attributed to the branch shall be allowable to  cover all costs of administering the subsidy program. Either method may  be used, but not both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Casualty reserve account. The costs assigned under this account  shall be any payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the  subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer  harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record  any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of an accident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Rehabilitation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For abandonment purposes the applicant  carrier shall project the amounts necessary to permit efficient  operations over the line segment. The carrier shall indicate the level  of FRA class safety standard to be attained with the amount of  expenditure. See 49 CFR part 213. Applicant, in making its projection of  rehabilitation costs, shall give consideration to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cost to attain the lowest operationally feasible track  level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the  lowest operating and rehabilitation expenditures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the  lowest loss, or highest profit, from operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For subsidy purposes rehabilitation costs shall not be included  unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The track fails to meet minimum Federal Railroad Administrative  class 1 safety standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case the railroad  will furnish, with the abandonment application, a detailed estimate of  the costs to rehabilitate the track to the minimum level; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The potential subsidizer requests a level of service which  requires expenditures for rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Off-branch costs. The off-branch costs developed in this section  shall be separated between ``off-branch costs other than return on  freight cars'' and ``return on value-freight cars''. The off-branch  costs shall be developed in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terminal costs, line-haul costs, interchange costs, and modified  terminal costs shall be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of  providing service over the remainder of the railroad's system. These  costs shall be computed by applying the variable unit costs to the  service units attributed to the branch line's traffic for the time  periods specified in Sec.  1152.22(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The procedure for determining the off-branch costs shall be  based upon the URCS cost formula. This formula shall be applied to the  latest Annual Report Form R-1 filed by the railroad, with two  exceptions. First, the amount used in the formula for freight car  depreciation shall be calculated using the procedure discussed in  paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section applied to the average total car  fleet of the railroad. Second, the return on investment in freight cars  shall be computed using the procedure set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)  of this section. In addition, the application of URCS shall include the  use of the nominal cost of capital for all return on investment  determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Class I Procedure: A Class I railroad shall calculate its  off-branch costs using the Class I procedure as set forth below in this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unit costs developed by applying URCS in the manner  specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section shall be applied to the  service characteristics of each movement of traffic that is attributed  to the branch line. This application shall result in the total off- branch cost associated with this traffic for normal terminal handlings,  line-haul mileage, and interchange events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The modified terminal cost per carload shall be calculated  separately   for each type of freight car and applied to each car that is attributed  to the branch line. The modified terminal cost shall consist of clerical  costs, two days of freight car cost, and an inter-intra train switching  cost (locomotive engine minute cost only). The clerical cost and inter- intra train switching cost shall be calculated from unit costs developed  within the individual URCS application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The unit costs for the clerical cost per carload calculation are  located in URCS Worktable E1, Part 1: Line 106, columns 1, 2, and 3;  line 107, column 1; line 108, column 1; line 109, column 1; and line  110, column 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated by  multiplying the total switch engine minute cost from URCS Worktable E1,  Part 1, line 111, columns 1, 2, and 3 by the total minutes specified in  the next sentence. The total minutes specified in this sentence shall  equal the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The minutes per switch event from Worktable E2, Part 1, line  118, column 29; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The product of the minutes per switch event from Worktable E2,  Part 1, line 118, column 29 and the ratio of loaded to total car miles  for the particular type of freight car being costed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The freight car cost shall be the car ownership costs per car  day for 2 days developed in accordance with the procedures set forth in  paragraph (g)(3) of this section for the type of freight car being  costed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a Class I railroad, the total costs calculated using the  procedures set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i) and (n)(3)(ii) of this  section shall constitute the off-branch costs attributable to the branch  line's traffic.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(xiv)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Class II or Class III railroad shall first determine which  URCS regional application will be used based on its geographical  location. The railroad's total estimated system variable expenses are  calculated by multiplying its total operating expenses by the ratio of  variable expenses to total expenses; this ratio is located in Worktable  D8, Part 6, line 615, column 1 of the URCS printout for the appropriate  region. If a railroad has passenger and freight service, the freight  portion of the total estimated system variable expenses shall be  calculated by multiplying the total estimated system variable expenses,  calculated as above, by the ratio of freight related operating expenses  to total railway operating expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total number of revenue carload terminal handlings, as  determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum  of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Originated and terminated (local) revenue carloads multiplied by  2; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interchanged and either originated or terminated (interline)  revenue carloads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of revenue carload interchange handlings, as  determined from the railroad's records, shall be calculated as the sum  of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Bridge (interchange to interchange) revenue carloads multiplied  by 2; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Revenue carloads that are interchanged and either originated or  terminated (interline).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The system average shipment weight per car, as determined from  the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ton-miles-revenue freight by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Loaded freight car miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The system average loaded car miles per car, as determined from  the railroad's records, shall be calculated by dividing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Revenue ton-miles by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Revenue tons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The railroad shall complete a URCS Phase III ``Movement Costing  Program'' based on the application of URCS data for the appropriate  region. The following data shall be inputs to the Phase III program  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The carrier code, either ``REG 4'' or ``REG 7'', shall  correspond to the appropriate region.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The type of shipment shall be designated as ``OD'' in order for  the movement to be costed as an interline movement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The distance shall be the system average loaded car miles per  car as developed in paragraph (n)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The type of freight car shall be identified as a Box, General  Service Equipped, which has an input user code of ``3''. If all of the  traffic on the branch line is transported in a single type of car, and  it is not a Box, General Service Equipped, the code for that type of car  may be substituted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The number of freight cars shall be ``1''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The car ownership factor shall be designated as ``R'' for  railroad owned cars unless all of the branch line traffic is moved in  privately owned cars, in which case the code ``P'' for privately owned  cars would be the input.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The program requires a loss and damage input. The code ``48'',  representing the average of all commodities, shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The input for shipment weight shall be the system average  shipment weight per car developed in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> The input for type of movement shall be ``1'', representing an  individual car movement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em>.
