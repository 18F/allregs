                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions applicable to this section-(1) Blasting agent. Blasting agent-any material or mixture, consisting of a fuel and oxidizer, intended for blasting, not otherwise classified as an explosive and in which none of the ingredients are classified as an explosive, provided that the finished product, as mixed and packaged for use or shipment, cannot be detonated by means of a No. 8 test blasting cap when unconfined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Blasting agent. Blasting agent-any material or mixture, consisting of a fuel and oxidizer, intended for blasting, not otherwise classified as an explosive and in which none of the ingredients are classified as an explosive, provided that the finished product, as mixed and packaged for use or shipment, cannot be detonated by means of a No. 8 test blasting cap when unconfined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Explosive-actuated power devices. Explosive-actuated power device-any tool or special mechanized device which is actuated by explosives, but not including propellant-actuated power devices. Examples of explosive-actuated power devices are jet tappers and jet perforators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Explosive. Explosive-any chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion, i.e., with substantially instantaneous release of gas and heat, unless such compound, mixture, or device is otherwise specifically classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation; see 49 CFR chapter I. The term ``explosives'' shall include all material which is classified as Class A, Class B, and Class C explosives by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and includes, but is not limited to dynamite, black powder, pellet powders, initiating explosives, blasting caps, electric blasting caps, safety fuse, fuse lighters, fuse igniters, squibs, cordeau

detonant fuse, instantaneous fuse, igniter cord, igniters, small arms ammunition, small arms ammunition primers, smokeless propellant, cartridges for propellant-actuated power devices, and cartridges for industrial guns. Commercial explosives are those explosives which are intended to be used in commercial or industrial operations.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1: Classification of explosives is described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as follows (see 49 CFR chapter I):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Class A explosives. Possessing, detonating, or otherwise maximum hazard; such as dynamite, nitroglycerin, picric acid, lead azide, fulminate of mercury, black powder, blasting caps, and detonating primers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Class B explosives. Possessing flammable hazard, such as propellant explosives (including some smokeless propellants), photographic flash powders, and some special fireworks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Class C explosives. Includes certain types of manufactured articles which contain Class A or Class B explosives, or both, as components but in restricted quantities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Forbidden or not acceptable explosives. Explosives which are forbidden or not acceptable for transportation by common carriers by rail freight, rail express, highway, or water in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, 49 CFR chapter I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Highway. Highway-any public street, public alley, or public road.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Magazine. Magazine-any building or structure, other than an explosives manufacturing building, used for the storage of explosives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Motor vehicle. Motor vehicle-any self-propelled vehicle, truck, tractor, semitrailer, or truck-full trailers used for the transportation of freight over public highways.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Propellant-actuated power devices. Propellant-actuated power devices-any tool or special mechanized device or gas generator system which is actuated by a smokeless propellant or which releases and directs work through a smokeless propellant charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnics-any combustible or explosive compositions or manufactured articles designed and prepared for the purpose of producing audible or visible effects which are commonly referred to as fireworks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Semiconductive hose. Semiconductive hose-a hose with an electrical resistance high enough to limit flow of stray electric currents to safe levels, yet not so high as to prevent drainage of static electric charges to ground; hose of not more than 2 megohms resistance over its entire length and of not less than 5,000 ohms per foot meets the requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Small arms ammunition. Small arms ammunition-any shotgun, rifle, pistol, or revolver cartridge, and cartridges for propellant-actuated power devices and industrial guns. Military-type ammunition containing explosive-bursting charges, incendiary, tracer, spotting, or pyrotechnic projectiles is excluded from this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Small arms ammunition primers. Small arms ammunition primers-small percussion-sensitive explosive charges, encased in a cup, used to ignite propellant powder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Smokeless propellants. Smokeless propellants-solid propellants, commonly called smokeless powders in the trade, used in small arms ammunition, cannon, rockets, propellant-actuated power devices, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Special industrial explosives devices. Special industrial explosives devices-explosive-actuated power devices and propellant-actuated power devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Special industrial explosives materials.

These comprise a wide variety of materials used for blasting. They all contain substantial proportions of water and high proportions of ammonium nitrate, some of which is in solution in the

water. Two broad classes of water gels are (i) those which are sensitized by a material classed as an explosive, such as TNT or smokeless powder, (ii) those which contain no ingredient classified as an explosive; these are sensitized with metals such as aluminum or with other fuels. Water gels may be premixed at an explosives plant or mixed at the site immediately before delivery into the borehole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> DOT specifications. Regulations of the Department of Transportation published in 49 CFR chapter I.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Miscellaneous provisions-(1) General hazard.
