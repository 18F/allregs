                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Persons charged with. The appropriate TTB officer shall have  charge of all real estate which has been or shall be assigned, set off,  or otherwise conveyed by purchase or otherwise to the United States in  payment of debts or penalties arising under provisions of 26 U.S.C.  enforced and administered by the Bureau or which has been or shall be  vested in the United States by mortgage, or other security for payment  of such debts, or which has been redeemed by the United States, or which  has been or shall be acquired by the United States for payment of or as  security for debts arising under provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and  administered by the Bureau, and of all trusts created for the use of the  United States in payment of such debts due the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sale. The appropriate TTB officer may sell any real estate owned  or held by the United States as aforesaid, subject to the following  rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Property purchased at sale under levy. If the property was  acquired as a result of being declared purchased for the United States  at a sale under 26 U.S.C. 6335, relating to sale of seized property, the  property shall not be sold until after the expiration of 180 days after  such sale under levy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of sale. A notice of sale shall be published in some  newspaper published or generally circulated within the county where the  property is situated, or a notice shall be posted at the post office  nearest the place where the property is situated and in at least two  other public places. The notice shall specify the property to be sold  and the time, place, manner and conditions of sale. In addition, the  appropriate TTB officer may use other methods of advertising and of  giving notice of the sale if the appropriate TTB officer believes such  methods will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time and place of sale. The time of the sale shall be not less  than 20 days from the date of giving public notice of sale under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The place of sale shall be within the  county where the property is situated. However, if the appropriate TTB  officer believes a substantially better price may be obtained, the sale  may be held outside such county.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rejection of bids and adjournment of sale. The officer  conducting the sale reserves the right to reject any and all bids and  withdraw the property from the sale. When it appears to the officer  conducting the sale that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the  interest of the United States, that officer may order the sale adjourned  from time to time. If the sale is adjourned for more than 30 days in the  aggregate, public notice of the sale must be given again in accordance  with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Liquidated damages. The notice shall state whether, in the cae  of default in payment of the bid price, any amount deposited with the  United States will be retained as liquidated damages. In case liquidated  damages are provided, the amount thereof shall not exceed $200.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Agreement to bid. The appropriate TTB officer may, before giving  notice of sale, solicit offers from prospective bidders and enter into  agreements with such persons that they will bid at least a specified  amount in case the property is offered for sale. In such cases, the  appropriate TTB officer may also require such persons to make deposits  to secure the performance of their agreements. Any such deposit, but not  more than $200, shall be retained as liquidated damages in case such  person fails to bid the specified amount and the property is not sold  for as much as the amount specified in such agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Terms. The property shall be offered for sale upon whichever of  the following terms is fixed by the appropriate TTB officer in the  public notice of sale:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payments in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the price of the property purchased by a successful bidder  at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of $200 or 20 percent  of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and payment of the  balance within a specified period, not to exceed one month from the date  of the sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Method of sale. The property may be sold either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be  received, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At public sale under sealed bids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Sales under sealed bids. The following rules, in addition to the  other rules provided in this paragraph (b), shall be applicable to  public sales under sealed bids.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Invitation to bidders. Bids shall be solicited through a public  notice of sale.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Form for use by bidders. A bid shall be submitted on a form  which will be furnished by the appropriate TTB officer upon request. The  form shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remittance with bid. If the total bid is $200 or less, the  full amount of the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is  more than $200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater,  shall be submitted therewith. Such remittance shall be by a certified,  cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company  incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of  any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S.  postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Time for receiving and opening bids. Each bid shall be  submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in  the upper left hand corner of the envelope the bidder's name and address  and the time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of  sale. A bid shall not be considered unless it is received by the officer  conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids will be  opened at the time and place stated in the notice of sale, or at the  time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Consideration of bids. The officer conducting the sale shall  have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. After the  opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the officer  conducting the sale shall announce the amount of the highest bid or bids  and the name of the successful bidder or bidders, unless in the opinion  of the officer a higher price can be obtained for the property than has  been bid. In the event the highest bids are equal in amount (and unless  in the opinion of the officer conducting the sale a higher price can be  obtained for the property than has been bid), the officer shall  determine the successful bidder by drawing lots. Any remittance  submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned to  the bidder at the conclusion of the sale.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Withdrawal of bid. A bid may be withdrawn on written or  telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for  opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the  bidder for the withdrawal of the bid after it has been opened.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Payment of bid price. All payments for property sold pursuant  to this section shall be made by cash or by a certified cashier's or  treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under  the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory,  or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express,  or telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance  of the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If payment  in full is not made at such time, the officer conducting the sale may  forthwith proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in  paragraph (b)(8) of this section. If deferred payment is permitted, the  initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the bid, and the  balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof.  Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid shall be applied  toward the purchase price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Deed. Upon payment in full of the purchase price, the  appropriate TTB officer shall execute a quitclaim deed to the purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lease. Until real estate is sold, the appropriate TTB officer  may lease such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Release to debtor. In cases where real estate has or may become  the property of the United States by conveyance or otherwise, in payment  of or as security for a debt arising under the laws relating to internal  revenue, and such debt shall have been paid, together with the interest  thereon (at the rate of 1 percent per month), to the   United States within 2 years from the date of the acquisition of such  real estate, the appropriate TTB officer may release by deed or  otherwise convey such real estate to the debtor from whom it was taken,  or to the debtor's heirs or other legal representatives. If property is  declared purchased by the United States under 26 U.S.C. 6335, then, for  the purpose of this paragraph, the date of such declaration shall be  deemed to be the date of acquisition of such real estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Accounting. The appropriate TTB officer shall, in accordance  with 26 U.S.C. 7809, account for the proceeds of all sales or leases of  the property and all expenses connected with the maintenance, sale, or  lease of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Authority of appropriate TTB officer. Notwithstanding the other  paragraphs of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may, when such  officer deems it advisable, take charge of, and assume responsibility  for, any real estate to which this section is applicable. In such case,  such officer will notify in writing the appropriate TTB officer from  whom he or she is taking charge and assuming responsibility. Also, in  any case where a single parcel of real estate is situated in an area in  which more than one officer has jurisdiction, the appropriate TTB  officer may designate in writing one officer who is to be in charge of,  and responsible for, the entire property.
