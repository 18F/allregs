Do not use in areas containing excess selenium. Do not rebolus within 4 months.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Selenium yeast is a dried, non-viable yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cultivated in a fed-batch fermentation which provides incremental amounts of cane molasses and selenium salts in a manner which minimizes the detrimental effects of selenium salts on the growth rate of the yeast and allows for optimal incorporation of inorganic selenium into cellular organic material. Residual inorganic selenium is eliminated in a rigorous washing process and must not exceed 2 percent of the total selenium content in the final selenium yeast product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Selenium, as selenium yeast, is added to feed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In complete feed for chickens, turkeys, swine, beef cattle, and dairy cattle at a level not to exceed 0.3 part per million.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In feed supplements for limit feeding for beef cattle at a level not to exceed an intake of 3 milligrams per head per day.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In salt-mineral mixtures for free-choice feeding for beef cattle up to 120 parts per million in a mixture for free-choice feeding at a rate not to exceed an intake of 3 milligrams per head per day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guaranteed organic selenium content from selenium yeast must be declared on the selenium yeast product label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The additive, as selenium yeast, shall be incorporated into feed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It shall be incorporated into each ton of complete feed by adding no less than 1 pound of a premix containing no more than 272.4 milligrams of added selenium per pound.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It shall be incorporated into each ton of salt-mineral mixture for beef cattle from a premix containing no more than 4.5 grams of added selenium per pound.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Usage of this additive must conform to the requirements of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
