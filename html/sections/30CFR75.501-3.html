Such notification shall include  the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and identification number of the existing mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A current map of the existing mine clearly setting out the  proposed new opening(s), mining plan and planned interconnection, if  any, with existing workings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement as to when the operator obtained the right to mine  the coal which the proposed new opening(s) will traverse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name of the coalbeds currently being mined and those which  the new opening(s) will traverse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The expected life of the mine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The reason(s) for the proposed new opening(s) (for example,  haulage, ventilation, drainage, to avoid bad roof, escapeway).  The District Manager shall require submission of any additional  information he considers pertinent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The District Manager shall make a determination based on all of  the information submitted by the operator as to whether the proposed new  opening(s) will be considered as a part of the existing mine or as a new  mine. The following guidelines and criteria shall be used by the  District Manager in making his determination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effect that the proposed new opening(s) will have on the  safety of the men working in the existing mine shall be considered of  primary importance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the operator had a right to mine the coal which the  proposed new openings will traverse prior to the date of enactment of  the Act (December 30, 1969) and whether the original mining plan  included mining such coal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether, in accordance with the usual mining practices common to  the particular district, the proposed new openings would have been  considered a new mine or part of the existing mine.

The District Manager shall notify the operator in writing within 30 days  of receiving all of the information, required and requested, of his  determination. No informal notification shall be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All new opening(s) shall be operated as a new mine prior to  receiving a written notification from the District Manager that such new  opening(s) will be considered part of an existing mine coming under  section 305(a)(2) of the Act and Sec. 75.501.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in this Sec. 75.501-3 shall be construed to relieve the  operator from compliance with any of the mandatory standards contained  in this part 75.
