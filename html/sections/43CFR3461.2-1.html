It the case of Criterion 19, application shall be made before approval of the mining permit. In the case of other deferred criteria, application shall be made prior to finalizing the environmental analysis for the area being studied for coal leasing. The authorized officer shall make every effort within the time and resources available to collect adequate and reliable data which would permit the application of Criterion 19 in the land use or activity planning process. When those data are obtained, the authorized officer shall make public his/her assessment on the application of the criterion or, if appropriate, the exception and the reasons therefor and allow opportunity for public comment on the adequacy of the application as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authorized officer shall make his/her assessment on the best available data that can be obtained given the time and resources available to prepare the plan.

a criterion or exception to only a portion of the tract, and if the authorized officer determines that it is likely that stipulations in the lease or permit to conduct surface coal mining operations could avoid any problems which may result from subsequent application of the criterion or exception, such tract may be included and analyzed in the regional lease sale environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any unsuitability assessments which result either from a designation or a termination of a designation of Federal lands as unsuitable by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or from changes warranted by additional data acquired in the activity planning process, may be made without formally revising or amending the comprehensive land use plan or analysis.
