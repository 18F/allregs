                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of imminent hazard. When an Administrator determines that a violation of a provision of the Federal hazardous material transportation law, or a regulation or order prescribed under that law, or an unsafe condition or practice, constitutes or is causing an imminent hazard, as defined in Sec. 109.1, the Administrator may issue or impose emergency restrictions, prohibitions, recalls, or out-of-service orders, without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing. The basis for any action taken under this section shall be set forth in writing which must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the violation, condition, or practice that constitutes or is causing the imminent hazard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set forth the terms and conditions of the emergency order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be limited to the extent necessary to abate the imminent hazard; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advise the recipient that, within 20 calendar days of the date the order is issued, recipient may request review; and that any request for a formal hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 must set forth the material facts in dispute giving rise to the request for a hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Set forth the filing and service requirements contained in Sec. 109.19(f), including the address of DOT Docket Operations and of all persons to be served with the petition for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Out-of-service order. An out-of-service order is issued to prohibit the movement of an aircraft, vessel, motor vehicle, train, railcar, locomotive, transport unit, transport vehicle, or other vehicle, or a freight container, portable tank, or other package until specified conditions of the out-of-service order have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon receipt of an out-of-service order, the person in possession of, or responsible for, the package must remove the package from transportation until it is brought into compliance with the out-of-service order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A package subject to an out-of-service order may be moved from the place where it was found to present an imminent hazard to the nearest location where the package can be brought into compliance, provided that the agent who issued the out-of-service order is notified before the move.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recipient of the out-of-service order must notify the operating administration that issued the order when

the package is brought into compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon receipt of an out-of-service order, a recipient may appeal the decision of the agent issuing the order to PHMSA's Chief Safety Officer. A petition for review of an out-of-service order must meet the requirements of Sec. 109.19.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recalls. PHMSA's Associate Administrator, Office of Hazardous Materials Safety, may issue an emergency order mandating the immediate recall of any packaging, packaging component, or container certified, represented, marked, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce when the continued use of such item would constitute an imminent hazard. All petitions for review of such an emergency order will be governed by the procedures set forth at Sec. 109.19.</p>
