There will be no fee charged to  such parties. One copy per person will also be provided to interested  persons at their request. The fee charged such persons shall be that  provided in Sec. 503.43 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comments on the DEIS must be received by the Commission within  ten (10) days of the date the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  publishes in the Federal Register notice that the DEIS was filed with  it. Sixteen copies shall be submitted as provided in Sec. 504.3(a).  Comments shall be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy  of the DEIS or the merits of the alternatives discussed in it. All  comments received will be made available to the public. Extensions of  time for commenting on the DEIS may be granted by the Commission for up  to ten (10) days if good cause is shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final environmental impact statements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After receipt of  comments on the DEIS, a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) will  be prepared pursuant to 40 CFR part 1502, which shall include a  discussion of the possible alternative actions to a potential or  proposed action. The FEIS will be distributed in the same manner as  specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FEIS shall be prepared prior to the Commission's final  decision and shall be filed with the Secretary, Federal Maritime  Commission. Upon filing, it shall become part of the administrative  record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any Commission action which has been assigned to an ALJ for  evidentiary hearing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The FEIS shall be submitted prior to the close of the record,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ALJ shall consider the environmental impacts and  alternatives contained in the FEIS in preparing the initial decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For all proposed Commission actions, any party may, by  petition to the Commission within ten (10) days following EPA's notice  in the Federal Register, assert that the FEIS contains a substantial and  material error of fact which can only be properly resolved by conducting  an evidentiary hearing, and expressly request that such a hearing be  held. Other parties may submit replies to the petition within ten (10)  days of its receipt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission may delineate the issue(s) and refer them to an  ALJ for expedited resolution or may elect to refer the petition to an  ALJ for consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ALJ shall make findings of fact on the issue(s) and shall  certify such findings to the Commission as a supplement to the FEIS. To  the extent that such findings differ from the FEIS, it shall be modified  by the supplement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Discovery may be granted by the ALJ on a showing of good cause  and, if granted, shall proceed on an expedited basis.
