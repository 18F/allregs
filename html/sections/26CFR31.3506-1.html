                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Companion sitting placement service. For  purposes of this section, the term ``companion sitting placement  service'' means a person (whether or not an individual) engaged in the  trade or business of placing sitters with individuals who wish to avail  themselves of the sitters' services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sitters. For purposes of this section, the term ``sitters''  means individuals who furnish personal attendance, companionship, or  household care services to children or to individuals who are elderly or  disabled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. For purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954 (relating to employment taxes), a companion sitting  placement service shall not be treated as the employer of its sitters,  and the sitters shall not be treated as the employees of the placement  service. However, the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply only if  the companion sitting placement service neither pays nor receives  (directly or through an agent) the salary or wages of the sitters, but  is compensated, if at all, on a fee basis by the   sitters or the individuals for whom the sitting is performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individuals deemed self-employed. Any individual who, by reason  of this section, is deemed not to be the employee of a companion sitting  placement service shall be deemed to be self-employed for purposes of  the tax on self-employment income (see sections 1401-1403 and the  regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax  Regulations)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>-2, a sitter is considered to be the  employee of the individual for whom the sitting is performed rather than  the employee of the companion sitting placement service, this section  has no effect upon that employee-employer relationship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. X is an agency that places babysitters with individuals  who desire babysitting services. X furnishes all the sitters with an  instruction manual regarding their conduct and appearance, requires them  to file semimonthly reports, and determines the total fee to be charged  the individual for whom the sitting is performed. Individuals who need a  babysitter contact the agency, are informed of the charges, and, if  agreement is reached, a sitter is sent to perform the services. The  sitter collects the entire amount of the charges and remits a percentage  to X as a fee for the placement. X is a companion sitting placement  service within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  Therefore, since the agency does not actually pay or receive the wages  of the sitters, X is not treated as the employer of the sitters for  purposes of this subtitle. The sitters are deemed to be self-employed  for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 1401.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the  individual for whom the sitting is performed pays to X the entire amount  of the charges. X retains a percentage and pays the difference to the  sitter. Since X actually receives and pays the wages of the sitters, X  is the employer of the sitters.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. As a service to the community a neighborhood association  maintains a list of individuals who are available to babysit. Parents in  need of a sitter contact the association and are provided with a list of  names and telephone numbers. The association charges no fee for the  service and takes no action other than compiling the list of sitters and  making it available to members of the community. Issues such as hours of  work, amount of payment, and the method by which the services are  performed are all resolved between the sitter and parent. A, a parent,  used the list to hire B to sit for A's child. B performs the services  four days a week in A's home and follows specific instructions given by  A. Under Sec. 31.3121(d)-1, B is the employee of A rather than the  employee of the neighborhood association. Consequently, this section  does not apply and B remains the employee of A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply to remuneration  received after December 31, 1974.  (Secs. 3506 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; 91 Stat. 1356  (26 U.S.C. 3506); 68A Stat. 917 (26 U.S.C. 7805))  [T.D. 7691, 45 FR 24129, Apr. 9, 1980]</p>
