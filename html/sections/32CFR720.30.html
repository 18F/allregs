                                Sec. 720.30  Production of official records in response to court order.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Where unclassified naval records are desired by or on  behalf of litigants, the parties will be informed that the records  desired, or certified copies thereof, may be obtained by forwarding to  the Secretary of the Navy, Navy Department, Washington, DC, or other  custodian of the records, a court order calling for the particular  records desired or copies thereof. Compliance with such court order will  be effected by transmitting certified copies of the records to the clerk  of the court out of which the process issues. See the provisions in the  Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5211.5 series which set forth the  additional requirement that reasonable efforts be made to notify all  individuals to whom the record pertains of (1) the disclosure, and (2)  the nature of the information provided, when the court order has become  a matter of public record and the record is contained in a system of  records as defined in the Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5211.5  series. If an original record is produced by a naval custodian, it will  not be removed from the custody of the person producing it, but copies  may be placed in evidence. Upon written request of one or more parties  in interest or their respective attorneys, records which would be  produced in response to a court order as set forth above may be  furnished without court order when such records are not in a `system of  records' as defined by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) except as noted  in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. In determining whether or not  a record contained in a ``system of records'' will be furnished in  response to a written request for that record, consideration shall be  given to the provisions of the Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42  series. If the record is in a ``system of records,'' it may be produced  upon written request of one or more parties in interest or their  respective attorneys in the absence of a court order only if the  individuals to whom the record pertains give written consent to the  production or if the production is otherwise authorized under the  Privacy Act and the Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5211.5 series.  Whenever compliance with a court order for production of Department of  the Navy records is deemed inappropriate for any reason, such as when  they contain privileged or classified information, the records and  subpoena may be forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy (Judge Advocate  General) for appropriate action, and the parties to the suit so  notified. Any release of classified information for civil court  proceedings (whether civil or criminal in nature) must also be  coordinated within the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-009D)  in accordance with the Chief of Naval Operations Instruction 5510.1  series.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records in the custody of National Personnel Records Center.  Court orders, subpoenas duces tecum, and other legal documents demanding  information from, or the production of, service or medical records in  the custody of the National Personnel Records Center involving former  (deceased or discharged) Navy and Marine Corps personnel shall be served  upon the General Services Administration, 9700 Page Boulevard; St.  Louis, MO 63132, rather than the Department of the Navy. In the  following situations, the request shall be forwarded to the Secretary of  the Navy (Judge Advocate General).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the United States (Department of the Navy) is one of the  litigants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the case involves a person or persons who are or have been  senior officers or officials within the Department of the Navy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In other cases considered to be of special significance to the  Judge Advocate General or the Secretary of the Navy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. Where not in conflict with the foregoing  restrictions relative to personal information, the release of which  would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the  production in Federal, State, territorial, or local courts of  evidentiary material from investigations conducted pursuant to this  Manual, and the service, employment, pay or medical records (including  medical records of dependents) of persons in the naval service is  authorized upon receipt of a court order, without procuring specific  authority from the Secretary of the Navy. When the request for  production involves material related to claims in favor of the  Government, notification should be made to the affirmative claims office  at the naval legal service office having territorial responsibility in  the area. Where travel is involved, it must be without expense to the  Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medical and other records of civilian employees. Production of  medical certificates or other medical reports concerning civilian  employees is controlled by the provisions of Executive Order 10561, 19  FR 5963, as implemented by Federal Personnel Manual, chapter 294, and  chapter 339.1-4 (reprinted in MANMED article 23-255(6)). Records of  civilian employees other than medical records may be produced upon  receipt of a court order without procuring specific authority from the  Secretary of the Navy, provided there is not involved any classified or  For-Official-Use-Only information, such as loyalty or security records.  Records relating to compensation benefits administered by the Bureau of  Employees' Compensation may not be disclosed except upon the written  approval of that Bureau (20 CFR 1.21). In case of doubt, the matter  should be handled in accordance with the provisions of subsection a  above. Where information is furnished hereunder in response to a court  order, it is advisable that certified copies rather than originals be  furnished and that, where original records are to be produced, the  assistance of the U.S. Attorney or U.S. Marshal be requested so that  custody of the records may be maintained.
