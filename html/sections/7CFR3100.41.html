                            <p class="depth0">These regulations are based upon and implement the following laws,  regulations, and Presidential directives:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Antiquities Act of 1906 (Pub. L. 59-209; 34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C.  431 et seq.) which provides for the protection of historic or  prehistoric remains or any object of antiquity on Federal lands;  establishes criminal sanctions for unauthorized destruction or  appropriation of antiquities; and authorizes scientific investigation of  antiquities on Federal lands, subject to permit and regulations.  Paleontological resources also are considered to fall within the  authority of this Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Historic Sites Act of 1935 (Pub. L. 74-292; 49 Stat. 666; 16  U.S.C. 461 et seq.) which authorizes the establishment of National  Historic Sites and otherwise authorizes the preservation of properties  of national historical or archeological significance; authorizes the  designation of National Historic Landmarks; establishes criminal  sanctions for violation of regulations pursuant to the Act; authorizes  interagency, intergovernmental, and interdisciplinary efforts for the  preservation of cultural resources; and other provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reservoir Salvage Act of 1960 (Pub. L. 86-521; 74 Stat. 220; 16  U.S.C. 469-469c.) which provides for the recovery and preservation of  historical and archeological data, including relics and specimens, that  might be lost or destroyed as a result of the construction of dams,  reservoirs, and attendant facilities and activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended (16  U.S.C. 470), which establishes positive national policy for the  preservation of the cultural environment, and sets forth a mandate for  protection in section 106. The purpose of section 106 is to protect  properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places  through review and comment by the ACHP of Federal undertakings that  affect such properties. Properties are listed on the National Register  or declared eligible for listing by the Secretary of the Interior. As  developed through the ACHP's regulations, section 106 establishes a  public interest process in which the Federal agency proposing an  undertaking, the State Historic Preservation Officer, the ACHP,  interested organizations and individuals participate. The process is  designed to insure that properties, impacts on them, and effects to them  are identified, and that alternatives to avoid or mitigate an adverse  effect on property eligible for the National Register are adequately  considered in the planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Pub. L.  91-190; 83   Stat. 852; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) which declares that it is the policy  of the Federal Government to preserve important historic, cultural, and  natural aspects of our national heritage. Compliance with NEPA requires  consideration of all environmental concerns during project planning and  execution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Executive Order 11593, ``Protection and Enhancement of the  Cultural Environment'', which gives the Federal Government the  responsibility for stewardship of our nation's heritage resources and  charges Federal agencies with the task of inventorying historic and  prehistoric sites on their lands. E.O. 11593 also charges agencies with  the task of identifying and nominating all historic properties under  their jurisdiction, and exercising caution to insure that they are not  transferred, sold, demolished, or substantially altered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Historical and Archeological Data Preservation Act of 1974.  (Pub. L. 93-291; 88 Stat. 174.) which amends the Reservoir Salvage Act  of 1960 to extend its provisions beyond the construction of dams to any  alteration of the terrain caused as a result of any Federal construction  project or federally licensed activity or program. In addition, the Act  provides a mechanism for funding the protection of historical and  archeological data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Presidential memorandum of July 12, 1978, ``Environmental  Quality and Water Resource Management'' which directs the ACHP to  publish final regulations, implementing section 106 of the National  Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and further directs each agency with  water and related land resources responsibilities to publish procedures  implementing those regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> 36 CFR part 800, ``Protection of Historic and Cultural  Properties'' which establishes procedures for the implementation of  section 106 of the NHPA, and directs publication of agency implementing  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Land use policy of the USDA (Secretary's Memorandum No. 1827  Revised, with Supplement) which establishes a commitment by the  Department to the preservation of farms, rural communities, and rural  landscapes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (40 U.S.C. 611) and  Executive Order 12072 (Federal Space Management). The Act encourages  adaptive use of historic buildings as administrative facilities for  Federal agencies and activities; the Executive Order directs Federal  agencies to locate administrative and other facilities in central  business districts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996)  which declares it to be the policy of the United States to protect and  preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to  believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American  Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians.</p>
