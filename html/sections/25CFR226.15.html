                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where lands in any leases are being drained of their oil or gas content by wells outside the lease, the lessee must drill or modify and produce all wells necessary to protect the leased lands from drainage within a reasonable time after the earlier of when the lessee knew or should have known of the drainage. In lieu of drilling or modifying necessary wells, the lessee may, with the consent of the Superintendent, pay compensatory royalty for drainage that has occurred or is occurring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions under paragraph (a) of this section are not required if the lessee proves to the Superintendent that when it first knew or had constructive notice of drainage it could not produce a paying quantity of oil or gas from a protective well on the lease for a reasonable profit above the cost of drilling, completing and operating the protective well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A lessee has constructive notice that drainage may be occurring when well completion or first production reports for the draining well are publicly available, or, if the lessee operates or owns any interest in the draining well or lease, upon completion of drill stem, production, pressure analysis, or flow tests of the draining well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a lessee assigns its interest in a lease or transfers its operating rights, it is liable for drainage that occurs before the date the assignment or transfer is approved by the Superintendent. Any lessee who acquires an interest in a lease on which the Superintendent has determined that the assignor was required to take action under paragraph (a) of this section is liable for paying compensatory royalties associated with production occurring on and after the date the assignment or transfer is approved by the Superintendent.</p>
