                                Sec. 12.50  Consumer products and industrial equipment subject to energy
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms  have the meanings indicated:</p><p class="depth2">Covered import. The term ``covered import'' means a consumer product  or industrial equipment that is classified by the Department of Energy  as covered by an applicable energy conservation standard, or by the  Federal Trade Commission as covered by an applicable energy labeling  standard, pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as  amended (42 U.S.C. 6291-6317), and for which an entry for consumption  has been filed, including products and equipment withdrawn from  warehouse for consumption or foreign merchandise entered for consumption  from a foreign trade zone.</p><p class="depth2">DOE. The term ``DOE'' means the Department of Energy.</p><p class="depth2">Energy conservation standard. The term ``energy conservation  standard'' means any standard meeting the definitions of that term in 42  U.S.C. 6291(6) or 42 U.S.C. 6311(18).</p><p class="depth2">FTC. The term ``FTC'' means the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p class="depth2">Noncompliant covered import. The term ``noncompliant covered  import'' means a covered import determined to be in violation of 42  U.S.C. 6302 or 42 U.S.C. 6316 as not in compliance with applicable  energy conservation or energy labeling standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CBP action; refusal of admission. CBP will refuse admission into  the customs territory of the United States to any covered import found  to be noncompliant with applicable energy conservation or energy  labeling standards. If DOE or FTC notifies CBP that a covered import  does not comply with an applicable energy conservation or energy  labeling standard, CBP will refuse admission to the covered import, or  pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, CBP may allow conditional  release of the covered import so that it may be brought into compliance.  CBP may make a finding that a covered import is noncompliant without  having received a prior written noncompliance notice from DOE or FTC. In  such a situation, CBP will confer with DOE or FTC, as applicable, as to  disposition of the import.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOE or FTC notice. Upon a determination that a covered import is  not in compliance with applicable energy conservation or labeling  standards, DOE or FTC, as applicable, will provide CBP with a written or  electronic notice that identifies the importer and contains a  description of the noncompliant covered import that is sufficient to  enable CBP to identify the subject merchandise and refuse admission  thereof into the customs territory of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditional release. In lieu of immediate refusal of admission  into the customs territory of the United States, CBP, pursuant to a  written or electronic recommendation from DOE or FTC, may permit the  release of a noncompliant covered import to the importer of record for  purposes of reconditioning, re-labeling, or other modification. The  release from CBP custody of any such covered import will be deemed  conditional and subject to the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62  of this chapter. Conditionally released covered imports are subject to  the jurisdiction of DOE and/or FTC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Duration. Unless extended in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of  this section, the conditional release period will terminate upon the  earliest occurring of the following events:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date CBP issues a notice of refusal of admission to the  importer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date DOE or FTC issues a notice to CBP stating that the  covered import is in compliance and may proceed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the conclusion of the 30-day period following the date of  release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extension. An importer may request an extension of the  conditional release period from DOE or FTC if made within the initial  30-day conditional release period or any subsequent authorized extension  thereof. CBP may permit an extension of the conditional release period  if recommended electronically or in writing, by DOE or FTC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issuance of redelivery notice and demand for redelivery. If DOE  or FTC notifies CBP in writing or electronically that noncompliant  covered imports have not timely been brought into compliance, CBP will  issue a refusal of admission notice to the importer and, in addition,  CBP will demand the redelivery of the specified covered import to CBP  custody. The demand for redelivery may be made concurrently with the  notice of refusal of admission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Liquidated damages. A failure to comply with a demand for  redelivery made under this paragraph (d) will result in the assessment  of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of the covered  product. Value as used in this provision means value as determined under  19 U.S.C. 1401a.  [78 FR 40390, July 5, 2013]</p><p class="depth3">Fur-Seal or Sea-Otter Skins</p>
