                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so  that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily  accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does  not--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing  facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of historic preservation programs, require the  agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment  of significant historic features of an historic property; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate  would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or  activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those  circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action  would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in  undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of  proving that compliance with Sec. 1600.150(a) would result in such  alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such  alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her  designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the  funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be  accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that  conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such  burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in  such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that  handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The agency may comply with the  requirements of this section through such means as redesign of  equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment  of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at  alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and  construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any  other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily  accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not  required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other  methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The  agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet  accessibility requirements   to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as  amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In  choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this  section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer  programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most  integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> or (a)(3), alternative  methods of achieving program accessibility include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those  portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made  accessible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through  portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made  accessible; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adopting other innovative methods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the  obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except  that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes  shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as  possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the  agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting  forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall  provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped  persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to  participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting  comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be  made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that  limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped  persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition  plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during  each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the  plan.</p>
