                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Threaded joints may be used within the limitations specified in subpart 56.15 of this chapter and within other limitations specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (Reproduces 114.1.) All threads on piping components must be taper pipe threads in accordance with the applicable standard listed in 46 CFR 56.60-1, table 56.60-1(b). Threads other than taper pipe threads may be used for piping components where tightness of the joint depends on a seal weld or a seating surface other than the threads, and where experience or test has demonstrated that such threads are suitable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Threaded joints may not be used where severe erosion, crevice corrosion, shock, or vibration is expected to occur; or at temperatures over 925 [deg]F.

For restrictions on the use of pipe in steam service more than 250 pounds per square inch or water service over 100 pounds per square inch and 200 [deg]F (938C), see part 104.1.2(c)(1) of ASME B31.1 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 56.01-2). Restrictions on the use of threaded joints apply for low-temperature piping and must be checked when designing for these systems.
