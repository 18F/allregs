                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Compliance is determined in the same way it is determined for 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW, including performance testing, monitoring of the collection system, continuous parameter monitoring, and other credible evidence. In addition, continuous parameter monitoring data, collected under 40 CFR 60.756(b)(1), (c)(1), and (d) of subpart WWW, are used to demonstrate compliance with the operating conditions for control systems. If a deviation occurs, you have failed to meet the control device operating conditions described in this subpart and have deviated from the requirements of this subpart. Finally, you must develop a written SSM plan according to the provisions in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3). A copy of the SSM plan must be maintained on site. Failure to write or maintain a copy of the SSM plan is a deviation from the requirements of this subpart.
