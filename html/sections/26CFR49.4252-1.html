                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and Sec. 49.4253-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amounts paid. For purposes of the tax in respect of general  telephone service, the term ``amounts paid'' means the amounts collected  for the service, whether the charge is made on a monthly or other  periodic basis, or is based on the number of calls made, or is in the  form of an assessment as in the case of a mutual telephone system. Where  a basic periodic charge is made for the service, with additional charges  for all calls or additional calls above a certain number, the additional  charges are also subject to the tax. Other rules relating to amounts  paid are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the charge for telephone service includes an additional  charge for not making payment within a specified time, the total amount  paid including the additional charge is the basis for computing the  amount of tax due. Similarly, where a discount is allowed for the  payment within a specified time of a charge for service rendered, the  tax is to be computed on the amount actually paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assessments or charges paid by members or subscribers of a  mutual or cooperative telephone company, association, or system for  switching services, or for the repair or replacement of instruments,  poles, wires, equipment, etc., incidental to ordinary maintenance, are  subject to the tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All amounts paid by subscribers for private branch exchange  service, for the use of switchboard, switching, and other telephone  equipment, for the use of trunk line facilities, for tie lines  connecting private branch exchanges, and for any extension line, are  subject to the tax on general telephone service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The tax attaches to the total charge made to a hotel or similar  subscriber for general telephone service furnished to the hotel or its  guests, but no tax attaches to any charge made by the hotel for service  rendered in placing the calls for its guests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In cases where a person leases lines or channels, equipment, and  other facilities used in conjunction with general telephone service, the  amounts paid by such person for such lines or   channels, equipment, and other facilities constitute amounts paid for  general telephone service, notwithstanding the fact that the lines or  channels, equipment, and other facilities used in conjunction with such  service are supplied by different persons or in part by the user of such  service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross reference. For other provisions relating to general  telephone service, see Sec. 49.4252-4.</p>
