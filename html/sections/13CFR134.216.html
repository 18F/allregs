                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At any time during the pendency of a case, the parties may  submit a joint motion requesting that the Judge permit the use of  alternative dispute resolution procedures to assist in resolving the  matter. If the motion is granted, the Judge will also stay the  proceedings before OHA, in whole or in part, as he or she deems  appropriate, pending the outcome of the alternative dispute resolution  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Judge may offer alternative dispute resolution procedures to  the parties at any time during the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The AA/OHA or a Judge may designate a Judge or attorney assigned  to OHA to serve as a neutral in alternative dispute resolution  procedures. If OHA provides the neutral and the mediation fails to  resolve all issues in the case, the OHA-provided neutral will not be  involved in the adjudication.
