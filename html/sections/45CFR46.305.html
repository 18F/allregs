Unless the principal investigator provides to the Board justification in writing for following some other procedures, control subjects must be selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the characteristics needed for that particular research project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The information is presented in language which is understandable to the subject population;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into account a prisoner's participation in the research in making decisions regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where the Board finds there may be a need for follow-up examination or care of participants after the end of their participation, adequate provision has been made for such examination or care, taking into account the varying lengths of individual prisoners' sentences, and for informing participants of this fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board shall carry out such other duties as may be assigned by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The institution shall certify to the Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary may require, that the duties of the Board under this section have been fulfilled.</p>
