                                Sec. 2424.1100  What is a limited denial of participation?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A limited denial of participation excludes a specific person from participating in a specific program, or programs, within a HUD field office's geographic jurisdiction, for a specific period of time. A limited denial of participation is normally issued by a HUD field office, but may be issued by a Headquarters office. The decision to impose a limited denial of participation is discretionary and based on the best interests of the federal government.</p>
