Each volume may be purchased separately from the Superintendent of Documents. The purchase price for a volume includes a subscription to replacement pages reflecting changes in the rules contained therein until such time as the volume is revised. Each volume is revised periodically, depending primarily on the frequency with which the rules it contains have been amended. When a volume is revised, the revised volume and replacement pages therefor will be furnished to those who renew their subscriptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
