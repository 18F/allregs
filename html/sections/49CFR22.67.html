                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Participating Lender must bring to the immediate attention  of the Director any delinquent STLP loans. The Participating Lender and  DOT OSDBU are jointly responsible for establishing collection procedures  and must exercise due diligence with respect to collection of delinquent  debt. The Participating Lender is responsible for initiating actions to  recover such debt. DOT OSDBU must approve any compromise of a claim,  resolution of a dispute, suspension or termination of collection action,  or referral for litigation. A work-out solution will only be considered  if it is expected to minimize the cost to the federal government in  resolving repayment delinquencies and/or loan default. They must only be  used when the borrower is likely to be able to repay the loan under the  terms of the work-out, and if the cost of establishing the work-out plan  is less than the costs of loan default and/or foreclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In an appropriate situation, DOT OSDBU may authorize the  Participating Lender to undertake legal action deemed necessary to  collect delinquent loans and DOT will reimburse the Participating Lender  on a pro rata basis in proportion to the loan guarantee percentage for  the associated fees and costs, with prior authorization from the  Director. Penalties and late fees are not eligible for reimbursement.  Any legal action undertaken by the Participating Lender without OSDBU  authorization will not be eligible for a pro rata basis reimbursement of  the associated fees and costs. Net recoveries applicable to accrued  interest must be applied on a pro rata basis in proportion to the  formula used during the term of the loan.</p>
