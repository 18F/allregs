A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to an exception set forth in this paragraph even if that increase would not be permitted under a different exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporary rate, fee, or charge exception. A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) upon the expiration of a specified period of six months or longer, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the commencement of that period, the card issuer disclosed in writing to the consumer, in a clear and conspicuous manner, the length of the period and the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that would apply after expiration of the period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon expiration of the specified period:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The card issuer must not apply an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred prior to the period that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to the period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the disclosures required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c), the card issuer must not apply an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred within 14 days after provision of the notice that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to that category of transactions prior to provision of the notice; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The card issuer must not apply an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred during the period that exceeds the increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Variable rate exception. A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The annual percentage rate varies according to an index that is not under the card issuer's control and is available to the general public; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The increase in the annual percentage rate is due to an increase in the index.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advance notice exception. A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with the applicable notice requirements in Sec. 1026.9(b), (c), or (g), provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a card issuer discloses an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b), the card issuer must not apply that rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred prior to provision of the notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a card issuer discloses an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g), the card issuer must not apply that rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after provision of the notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This exception does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (xii) during the first year after the account is opened, while the account is closed, or while the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, an account is considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in transactions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Delinquency exception. A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii),

A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) due to the consumer's completion of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or the consumer's failure to comply with the terms of such an arrangement, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to commencement of the arrangement (except as provided in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D)), the card issuer has provided the consumer with a clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the terms of the arrangement (including any increases due to the completion or failure of the arrangement); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon the completion or failure of the arrangement, the card issuer must not apply to any transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the arrangement an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to commencement of the arrangement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception. If an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (xii) has been decreased pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or state statute or regulation, a card issuer may increase that annual percentage rate, fee, or charge once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar statute or regulation no longer applies, provided that the card issuer must not apply to any transactions that occurred prior to the decrease an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to the decrease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of protected balances--(1) Definition of protected balance. For purposes of this paragraph, ``protected balance'' means the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) cannot be applied after the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of protected balance. For purposes of this paragraph, ``protected balance'' means the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) cannot be applied after the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repayment of protected balance. The card issuer must not require repayment of the protected balance using a method that is less beneficial to the consumer than one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The method of repayment for the account before the effective date of the increase;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An amortization period of not less than five years, beginning no earlier than the effective date of the increase; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A required minimum periodic payment that includes a percentage of the balance that is equal to no more than twice the percentage required before the effective date of the increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuing application. This section continues to apply to a balance on a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan after:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The account is closed or acquired by another creditor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The balance is transferred from a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor to another credit account issued by the same creditor or its affiliate or subsidiary (unless the account to which the balance is transferred is subject to Sec. 1026.40).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Promotional waivers or rebates of interest, fees, and other charges. If a card issuer promotes the waiver or rebate of finance charges due to a periodic interest rate or fees or charges required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (xii) and applies the waiver or rebate to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, any cessation of the waiver or rebate on that account constitutes an increase in an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge for purposes of this section.</p>
