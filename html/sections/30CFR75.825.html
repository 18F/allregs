                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Main disconnecting switch. The power center supplying high voltage power to the continuous mining machine must be equipped with a main disconnecting switch that, when in the open position, de-energizes input to all power transformers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Trailing cable disconnecting device. In addition to the main disconnecting switch required in paragraph (a) of this section, the power center must be equipped with a disconnecting device for each circuit that supplies power to a high-voltage continuous mining machine. A disconnecting device is defined as a disconnecting switch or a cable coupler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disconnecting switches. Each disconnecting switch must be labeled to clearly identify the circuit it disconnects, and be designed and installed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rated for the maximum phase-to-phase voltage of the circuit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rated for the full-load current of the circuit that is supplied power through the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow for visual observation, without removing any covers, to verify that the contacts are open;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ground all power conductors on the load side when the switch is in the ``open and grounded'' position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Can only be locked out in the ``open and grounded'' position; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Safely interrupts the full-load current of the circuit or causes the current to be interrupted automatically before the disconnecting switch opens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Barriers and covers. All compartments that provide access to high-voltage circuits must have barriers and/or covers to prevent miners from contacting energized high-voltage circuits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Main disconnecting switch and control circuit interlocking. The control circuit must be interlocked with the main disconnecting switch in the power center so that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the main disconnecting switch is in the ``open'' position, the control circuit can only be powered through an auxiliary switch in the ``test'' position; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the main disconnecting switch is in the ``closed'' position, the control circuit can only be powered through an auxiliary switch in the ``normal'' position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interlocks. Each cover or removable barrier providing access to high-voltage circuits must be equipped with at least two interlock switches. Except when the auxiliary switch is on the ``test'' position, removal of any cover or barrier that exposes energized high-voltage circuits must cause the interlock switches to automatically de-energize the incoming circuit to the power center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Emergency stop switch. The power center must be equipped with an externally accessible emergency stop switch hard-wired into the incoming ground-wire monitor circuit that de-energizes the incoming high-voltage in the event of an emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Grounding stick. The power center must be equipped with a grounding stick to be used prior to performing electrical work to assure that high-voltage capacitors are discharged and circuits are de-energized. The power center must have a label readily identifying the location of the grounding stick. The grounding stick must be stored in a dry location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Caution label. All compartments providing access to energized high-voltage conductors and parts must display a caution label to warn miners against entering the compartments before de-energizing incoming high-voltage circuits.
