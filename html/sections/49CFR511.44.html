                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. An expert witness is one who, by reason of  education, training, experience, or profession, has peculiar knowlege  concerning the matter of science or skill to which his or her testimony  relates and from which he or she may draw inferences based upon  hypothetically stated facts or from facts involving scientific or  technical knowledge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of presenting testimony of expert witness. Except as may  be otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, a detailed written  statement of the elements of the direct testimony of an expert witness  shall be filed on the record and exchanged between the parties no   later than 10 days preceding the commencement of the hearing. The  statement must contain a full explanation of the methodology underlying  any analysis, and a full disclosure of the basis of any opinion. The  direct testimony of an expert witness shall not include points not  contained in the written statement. A party may waive direct examination  of an expert witness by indicating that the written statement be  considered the testimony of the witness. In such a case, the written  testimony shall be incorporated into the record and shall constitute the  testimony of the witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross-examination and redirect examination of expert witness.  Cross-examination, redirect examination, and re-cross-examination of an  expert witness will proceed in due course based upon the written  testimony and any amplifying oral testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to file and/or to exchange written statement. Failure to  file and/or to exchange the written statement of an expert witness as  provided in this section shall deprive the sponsoring party of the use  of the expert witness and of the conclusions which that witness would  have presented.</p>
