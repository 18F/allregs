This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action  proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed  action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law  asserted as the basis for this action, and either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice  within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible  GSA official that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (b) advise the  applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for  hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be  reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if  any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant  or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and  argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to  request a hearing under this section or to appear at a hearing for which  a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a  hearing under section 602 of the Act and Sec. 101-6.211-3, and consent  to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
