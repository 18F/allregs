                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Substitutions and assumptions of options--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  This paragraph (a) provides rules under which an eligible corporation  (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) may, by reason of a  corporate transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section),  substitute a new statutory option (new option) for an outstanding  statutory option (old option) or assume an old option without such  substitution or assumption being considered a modification of the old  option. For the definition of modification, see paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.421-1 through 1.424-1, the phrase  ``substituting or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which  section 424 applies,'' ``substituting or assuming a stock option in a  transaction to which Sec. 1.424-1(a) applies,'' and similar phrases  means a substitution of a new option for an old option or an assumption  of an old option that meets the requirements of this paragraph (a). For  a substitution or assumption to qualify under this paragraph (a), the  substitution or assumption must meet all of the requirements described  in paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the  term eligible corporation means a corporation that is the employer of  the optionee or a related corporation of such corporation. For purposes  of this paragraph (a), the determination of whether a corporation is the  employer of the optionee or a related corporation of such corporation is  based upon all of the relevant facts and circumstances existing  immediately after the corporate transaction. See Sec. 1.421-1(h) for  rules concerning the employment relationship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corporate transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the  term corporate transaction includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or  stock, separation, reorganization, or liquidation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A distribution (excluding an ordinary dividend or a stock split  or stock dividend described in Sec. 1.424-1(e)(4)(v)) or change in the  terms or number of outstanding shares of such corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Such other corporate events prescribed by the Commissioner in  published guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> By reason of. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a change in an option or issuance of a new  option to qualify as a substitution or assumption under this paragraph  (a), the change must be made by an eligible corporation (as defined in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and occur by reason of a corporate  transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Generally, a change in an option or issuance of a new option is  considered to be by reason of a corporate transaction, unless the  relevant facts and circumstances demonstrate that such change or  issuance is made for reasons unrelated to such corporate transaction.  For example, a change in an option or issuance of a new option will be  considered to be made for reasons unrelated to a corporate transaction  if there is an unreasonable delay between the corporate transaction and  such change in the option or issuance of a new option, or if the  corporate transaction serves no substantial corporate business purpose  independent of the change in options. Similarly, a change in the number  or price of shares purchasable under an option merely to reflect market  fluctuations in the price of the stock purchasable under an option is  not by reason of a corporate transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change in an option or issuance of a new option is by reason  of a distribution or change in the terms or number of the outstanding  shares of a corporation (as described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this  section) only if the option as changed, or the new option issued, is an  option on the same stock as under the old option (or if such class of  stock is eliminated in the change in capital structure, on other stock  of the same corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> must be met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an issuance of a new option (or a portion  thereof) in exchange for an old option (or portion thereof), the  optionee's rights under the old option (or portion thereof)   must be canceled, and the optionee must lose all rights under the old  option (or portion thereof). There cannot be a substitution of a new  option for an old option within the meaning of this paragraph (a) if the  optionee may exercise both the old option and the new option. It is not  necessary to have a complete substitution of a new option for the old  option. However, any portion of such option which is not substituted or  assumed in a transaction to which this paragraph (a) applies is an  outstanding option to purchase stock or, to the extent paragraph (e) of  this section applies, a modified option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares  subject to the new or assumed option immediately after the change in the  option or issuance of a new option over the aggregate option price of  such shares must not exceed the excess of the aggregate fair market  value of all shares subject to the old option (or portion thereof)  immediately before the change in the option or issuance of a new option  over the aggregate option price of such shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On a share by share comparison, the ratio of the option price  to the fair market value of the shares subject to the option immediately  after the change in the option or issuance of a new option must not be  more favorable to the optionee than the ratio of the option price to the  fair market value of the stock subject to the old option (or portion  thereof) immediately before the change in the option or issuance of a  new option. The number of shares subject to the new or assumed option  may be adjusted to compensate for any change in the aggregate spread  between the aggregate option price and the aggregate fair market value  of the shares subject to the option immediately after the change in the  option or issuance of the new option as compared to the aggregate spread  between the option price and the aggregate fair market value of the  shares subject to the option immediately before the change in the option  or issuance of the new option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The new or assumed option must contain all terms of the old  option, except to the extent such terms are rendered inoperative by  reason of the corporate transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The new option or assumed option must not give the optionee  additional benefits that the optionee did not have under the old option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Obligation to substitute or assume not necessary. For a change  in the option or issuance of a new option to meet the requirements of  this paragraph (a), it is not necessary to show that the corporation  changing an option or issuing a new option is under any obligation to do  so. In fact, this paragraph (a) may apply even when the option that is  being replaced or assumed expressly provides that it will terminate upon  the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. However, this  paragraph (a) cannot be applied to revive a statutory option which, for  reasons not related to the corporate transaction, expires before it can  properly be replaced or assumed under this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Issuance of stock without meeting the requirements of this  paragraph (a). A change in the terms of an option resulting in a  modification of such option occurs if an optionee's new employer (or a  related corporation of the new employer) issues its stock (or stock of a  related corporation) upon exercise of such option without satisfying all  of the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Date of grant. For purposes of applying the rules of this  paragraph (a), a substitution or assumption is considered to occur on  the date that the optionee would, but for this paragraph (a), be  considered to have been granted the option that the eligible corporation  is substituting or assuming. A substitution or an assumption that occurs  by reason of a corporate transaction may occur before or after the  corporate transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any reasonable methods may be used to determine the fair market  value of the stock subject to the option immediately before the  assumption or substitution and the fair market value of the stock  subject to the option immediately after the assumption or substitution.  Such methods include the valuation methods described in Sec. 20.2031-2  of this chapter (the Estate Tax Regulations). In the case of stock   listed on a stock exchange, the fair market value may be based on the  last sale before and the first sale after the assumption or substitution  if such sales clearly reflect the fair market value of the stock, or may  be based upon an average selling price during a longer period, such as  the day or week before, and the day or week after, the assumption or  substitution. If the stocks are not listed, or if they are newly issued,  it will be reasonable to base the determination on experience over even  longer periods. In the case of a merger, consolidation, or other  reorganization which is arrived at by arm's-length negotiations, the  fair market value of the stocks subject to the option before and after  the assumption or substitution may be based upon the values assigned to  the stock for purposes of the reorganization. For example, if in the  case of a merger the parties treat each share of the merged company as  being equal in value to a share of the surviving company, it will be  reasonable to assume that the stocks are of equal value so that the  substituted option may permit the employee to purchase at the same price  one share of the surviving company for each share he could have  purchased of the merged company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Eligible corporation. X Corporation acquires a new  subsidiary, Y Corporation, and transfers some of its employees to Y. Y  Corporation wishes to grant to its new employees and to the employees of  X Corporation new options for Y shares in exchange for old options for X  shares that were previously granted by X Corporation. Because Y  Corporation is an employer with respect to its own employees and a  related corporation of X Corporation, Y Corporation is an eligible  corporation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to both  the employees of X and Y Corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2004, Z  Corporation grants E, an employee of Z, an option to acquire 100 shares  of Z common stock. At the time of grant, the fair market value of Z  common stock is $200 per share. E's option price is $200 per share. On  July 1, 2005, when the fair market value of Z common stock is $400, Z  declares a stock dividend of preferred stock distributed on common stock  that causes the fair market value of Z common stock to decrease to $200  per share. On the same day, Z grants to E a new option to acquire 200  shares of Z common stock in exchange for E's old option. The new option  has an exercise price of $100 per share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section. Generally, the issuance of a new option is considered to be by  reason of a corporate transaction. None of the facts in this Example 2  indicate that the new option is not issued by reason of the stock  dividend. In addition, the new option is issued on the same stock as the  old option. Thus, the substitution occurs by reason of the corporate  transaction. Assuming the other requirements of this section are met,  the issuance of the new option is a substitution that meets the  requirements of this paragraph (a) and is not a modification of the  option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 2.  Assume further that on December 1, 2005, Z declares an ordinary cash  dividend. On the same day, Z grants E a new option to acquire Z stock in  substitution for E's old option. Under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this  section, an ordinary cash dividend is not a corporate transaction. Thus,  the exchange of the new option for the old option does not meet the  requirements of this paragraph (a) and is a modification of the option.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporate transaction. On March 15, 2004, A Corporation  grants E, an employee of A, an option to acquire 100 shares of A stock  at $50 per share, the fair market value of A stock on the date of grant.  On May 2, 2005, A Corporation transfers several employees, including E,  to B Corporation, a related corporation. B Corporation arranges to  purchase some assets from A on the same day as E's transfer to B. Such  purchase is without a substantial business purpose independent of making  the exchange of E's old options for the new options appear to be by  reason of a corporate transaction. The following day, B Corporation  grants to E, one of its new employees, an option to acquire shares of B  stock in exchange for the old option held by E to acquire A stock. Under  paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the purchase of assets is a  corporate transaction. Generally, the substitution of an option is  considered to occur by reason of a corporate transaction. However, in  this case, the relevant facts and circumstances demonstrate that the  issuance of the new option in exchange for the old option occurred by  reason of the change in E's employer rather than a corporate transaction  and that the sale of assets is without a substantial corporate business  purpose independent of the change in the options. Thus, the exchange of  the new option for the old option is not by reason of a corporate  transaction that meets the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is a  modification of the old option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> E, an employee of Corporation  A, holds an option to acquire 100 shares of Corporation A stock. On  September 1, 2006, Corporation A has one class of stock outstanding and  declares a stock dividend of one share of common stock for each  outstanding share of common stock. The rights associated with the common  stock issued as a dividend are the same as the rights under existing  shares of stock. In connection with the stock dividend, E's option is  exchanged for an option to acquire 200 shares of Corporation A stock.  The per-share exercise price is equal to one half of the per-share  exercise price of the original option. The stock dividend merely changes  the number of shares of Corporation A outstanding and effects no other  change to the stock of Corporation A. The option is proportionally  adjusted and the aggregate exercise price remains the same and therefore  satisfies the requirements described in Sec. 1.424-1(e)(4)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stock dividend is not a corporate transaction under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the declaration of the stock  dividend is not a modification of the old option under paragraph (a) of  this section. Pursuant to Sec. 1.424-1(e)(4)(v), the exercise price of  the old option may be adjusted proportionally with the change in the  number of outstanding shares of Corporation A such that the ratio of the  aggregate exercise price of the option to the number of shares covered  by the option is the same both before and after the stock dividend. The  adjustment of E's option is not treated as a modification of the option.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Additional benefit. On June 1, 2004, P Corporation  acquires 100 percent of the shares of S Corporation and issues a new  option to purchase P shares in exchange for an old option to purchase S  shares that is held by E, an employee of S. On the date of the exchange,  E's old option is exercisable for 3 more years, and, after the exchange,  E's new option is exercisable for 5 years. Because the new option is  exercisable for an additional period of time beyond the time allowed  under the old option, the effect of the exchange of the new option for  the old option is to give E an additional benefit that E did not enjoy  under the old option. Thus, the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this  section are not met, and this paragraph (a) does not apply to the  exchange of the new option for the old option. Therefore, the exchange  is a modification of the old options.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Spread and ratio tests. E is an employee of S  Corporation. E holds an old option that was granted to E by S to  purchase 60 shares of S at $12 per share. On June 1, 2005, S Corporation  is merged into P Corporation, and on such date P issues a new option to  purchase P shares in exchange for E's old option to purchase S shares.  Immediately before the exchange, the fair market value of an S share is  $32; immediately after the exchange, the fair market value of a P share  is $24. The new option entitles E to buy P shares at $9 per share.  Because, on a share-by-share comparison, the ratio of the new option  price ($9 per share) to the fair market value of a P share immediately  after the exchange ($24 per share) is not more favorable to E than the  ratio of the old option price ($12 per share) to the fair market value  of an S share immediately before the exchange ($32 per share) (\9/24\ =  \12/32\), the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section are  met. The number of shares subject to E's option to purchase P stock is  set at 80. Because the excess of the aggregate fair market value over  the aggregate option price of the shares subject to E's new option to  purchase P stock, $1,200 (80 x $24 minus 80 x $9), is not greater than  the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate option  price of the shares subject to E's old option to purchase S stock,  $1,200 (60 x $32 minus 60 x $12), the requirements of paragraph  (a)(5)(ii) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Ratio test and partial substitution. Assume the same  facts as in Example 6, except that the fair market value of an S share  immediately before the exchange of the new option for the old option is  $8, that the option price is $10 per share, and that the fair market  value of a P share immediately after the exchange is $12. P sets the new  option price at $15 per share. Because, on a share-by-share comparison,  the ratio of the new option price ($15 per share) to the fair market  value of a P share immediately after the exchange ($12) is not more  favorable to E than the ratio of the old option price ($10 per share) to  the fair market value of an S share immediately before the substitution  ($8 per share) (\15/12\ = \10/8\), the requirements of paragraph  (a)(5)(iii) of this section are met. Assume further that the number of  shares subject to E's P option is set at 20, as compared to 60 shares  under E's old option to buy S stock. Immediately after the exchange, 2  shares of P are worth $24, which is what 3 shares of S were worth  immediately before the exchange (2 x $12 = 3 x $8). Thus, to achieve a  complete substitution of a new option for E's old option, E would need  to receive a new option to purchase 40 shares of P (i.e., 2 shares of P  for each 3 shares of S that E could have purchased under the old option  (\2/3\ = \40/60\)). Because E's new option is for only 20 shares of P, P  has replaced only \1/2\ of E's old option, and the other \1/2\ is still  outstanding.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Partial substitution. X Corporation forms a new  corporation, Y Corporation, by a transfer of certain assets and, in a  spin-off, distributes the shares of Y Corporation to the stockholders of  X Corporation. E, an employee of X Corporation, is thereafter an  employee of Y. Y wishes to substitute a new option to purchase some of  its stock for E's old option to purchase 100 shares of X. E's   old option to purchase shares of X, at $50 a share, was granted when the  fair market value of an X share was $50, and an X share was worth $100  just before the distribution of the Y shares to X's stockholders.  Immediately after the spin-off, which is also the time of the  substitution, each share of X and each share of Y is worth $50. Based on  these facts, a new option to purchase 200 shares of Y at an option price  of $25 per share could be granted to E in complete substitution of E's  old option. In the alternative, it would also be permissible in  connection with the spin off, to grant E a new option to purchase 100  shares of Y, at an option price of $25 per share, and for E to retain an  option to purchase 100 shares of X under the old option, with the option  price adjusted to $25. However, because X is no longer a related  corporation with respect to Y, E must exercise the option for 100 shares  of X within three months from the date of the spin off for the option to  be treated as a statutory option. See Sec. 1.421-1(h). It would also be  permissible to grant E a new option to purchase 100 shares of Y, at an  option price of $25 per share, in substitution for E's right to purchase  50 of the shares under the old option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation, a  publicly traded corporation, adopts an incentive stock option plan that  meets the requirements of Sec. 1.422-2. Under the plan, options to  acquire X stock are granted to X employees. X Corporation is acquired by  Y Corporation and becomes a subsidiary corporation of Y Corporation.  After the acquisition, X employees remain employees of X. In connection  with the acquisition, Y Corporation substitutes new options to acquire Y  stock for the old options to acquire X stock previously granted to the  employees of X. As a result of this substitution, on exercise of the new  options, X employees receive Y Corporation stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the requirements of Sec. 1.422-2 were met on the date  of grant, the substitution of the new Y options for the old X options  does not require new stockholder approval. If the other requirements of  paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section are met, the issuance of new  options for Y stock in exchange for the old options for X stock meets  the requirements of this paragraph (a) and is not a modification of the  old options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, the stockholders of X (in this case, Y) must approve the  plan within 12 months before or after the date of the amendment of the  plan. If the stockholders of X (in this case, Y) timely approve the  plan, the future grants to acquire Y stock will be incentive stock  options (assuming the other requirements of Sec. 1.422-2 have been  met).</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Modification. X Corporation merges into Y Corporation. Y  Corporation retains employees of X who hold old options to acquire X  Corporation stock. When the former employees of X exercise the old  options, Y Corporation issues Y stock to the former employees of X.  Under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, because Y issues its stock on  exercise of the old options for X stock, there is a change in the terms  of the old options for X stock. Thus, the issuance of Y stock on  exercise of the old options is a modification of the old options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D Corporation grants an option  to acquire 100 shares of D Corporation stock to E, an employee of D  Corporation. S Corporation is a subsidiary of D Corporation. On March 1,  2005, D Corporation spins off S Corporation. E remains an employee of D  Corporation. In connection with the spin off, D Corporation substitutes  a new option to acquire D Corporation stock and a new option to acquire  S Corporation stock for the old option in a manner that meets the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The substitution of the new option to acquire S and D stock for  the old option to acquire D stock is not a modification of the old  option. However, because S is no longer a related corporation with  respect to D Corporation, E must exercise the option for S stock within  three months from March 1, 2005, for the option to be treated as a  statutory option. See Sec. 1.421-1(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 11  except that E's employment with D Corporation is terminated on February  20, 2005. The substitution of the new option to acquire S and D stock  for the old option to acquire D stock is not a modification of the old  option. However, because the employment relationship between E and D  Corporation terminated on February 20, 2005, E must exercise the option  for the D and S stock within three months from February 20, 2005, for  the option to be treated as a statutory option. See Sec. 1.421-1(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of new stock. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 424(b) provides that the  rules provided by sections 421 through 424 which are applicable with  respect to stock transferred to an individual upon his exercise of an  option, shall likewise be applicable with respect to stock acquired by a  distribution or an exchange to which section 305, 354, 355, 356, or 1036  (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applies. Stock  so acquired shall, for purposes of sections   421 through 424, be considered as having been transferred to the  individual upon his exercise of the option. A similar rule shall be  applied in the case of a series of such acquisitions. With respect to  such acquisitions, section 424(b) does not make inapplicable any of the  provisions of section 305, 354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section  1031 as relates to section 1036).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. If, with respect to stock transferred pursuant to the  timely exercise of a statutory option, there is a distribution of new  stock to which section 305(a) is applicable, and if there is a  disposition of such new stock before the expiration of the applicable  holding period required with respect to the stock originally acquired  pursuant to the exercise of such option, such disposition makes section  421 inapplicable to the transfer of the original stock pursuant to the  exercise of the option to the extent that the disposition effects a  reduction of the individual's total interest in the old and new stock.  However, if the new stock, as well as the old stock, is not disposed of  before the expiration of the holding period required with respect to the  original stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the option, the  special tax treatment provided by section 421 is applicable to both the  original shares and the shares acquired by virtue of the distribution to  which section 305(a) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disposition of stock. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of sections 421 through  424, the term ``disposition of stock'' includes a sale, exchange, gift,  or any transfer of legal title, but does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A transfer from a decedent to his estate or a transfer by  bequest or inheritance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exchange to which is applicable section 354, 355, 356, or  1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A mere pledge or hypothecation. However, a disposition of the  stock pursuant to a pledge or hypothecation is a disposition by the  individual, even though the making of the pledge or hypothecation is not  such a disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A transfer between spouses or incident to divorce (described in  section 1041(a)). The special tax treatment of Sec. 1.421-2(a) with  respect to the transferred stock applies to the transferee. However, see  Sec. 1.421-1(b)(2) for the treatment of the transfer of a statutory  option incident to divorce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A share of stock acquired by an individual pursuant to the  exercise of a statutory option is not considered disposed of by the  individual if such share is taken in the name of the individual and  another person jointly with right of survivorship, or is subsequently  transferred into such joint ownership, or is retransferred from such  joint ownership to the sole ownership of the individual. However, any  termination of such joint ownership (other than a termination effected  by the death of a joint owner) is a disposition of such share, except to  the extent the individual reacquires ownership of the share. For  example, if such individual and his joint owner transfer such share to  another person, the individual has made a disposition of such share.  Likewise, if a share of stock held in the joint names of such individual  and another person is transferred to the name of such other person,  there is a disposition of such share by the individual. If an individual  exercises a statutory option and a share of stock is transferred to  another or is transferred to such individual in his name as trustee for  another, the individual has made a disposition of such share. However, a  termination of joint ownership resulting from the death of one of the  owners is not a disposition of such share. For determination of basis in  the hands of the survivor where joint ownership is terminated by the  death of one of the owners, see section 1014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an optionee exercises an incentive stock option with  statutory option stock and the applicable holding period requirements  (under Sec. 1.422-1(a) or Sec. 1.423-1(a)) with respect to such  statutory option stock are not met before such transfer, then sections  354, 355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of 1031 as relates to 1036) do not  apply to determine whether there is a disposition of those shares.  Therefore, there is a disposition of the statutory option stock, and the  special tax treatment of Sec. 1.421-2(a) does not apply to such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On June 1, 2004, the X Corporation grants to E, an  employee, a statutory   option to purchase 100 shares of X Corporation stock at $100 per share,  the fair market value of X Corporation stock on that date. On June 1,  2005, while employed by X Corporation, E exercises the option in full  and pays X Corporation $10,000, and on that day X Corporation transfers  to E 100 shares of its stock having a fair market value of $12,000.  Before June 1, 2006, E makes no disposition of the 100 shares so  purchased. E realizes no income on June 1, 2005, with respect to the  transfer to him of the 100 shares of X Corporation stock. X Corporation  is not entitled to any deduction at any time with respect to its  transfer to E of the stock. E's basis for such 100 shares is $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume  that on August 1, 2006, three years and two months after the transfer of  the shares to him, E sells the 100 shares of X Corporation stock for  $13,000 which is the fair market value of the stock on that date. For  the taxable year in which the sale occurs, E realizes a gain of $3,000  ($13,000 minus E's basis of $10,000), which is treated as capital gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except assume  that on August 1, 2006, E makes a gift of the 100 shares of Y  Corporation stock to his son. Such disposition results in no realization  of gain to E either for the taxable year in which the option is  exercised or the taxable year in which the gift is made. E's basis of  $10,000 becomes the donee's basis for determining gain or loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume  that on May 1, 2006, E sells the 100 shares of X Corporation stock for  $13,000. The special rules of section 421(a) are not applicable to the  transfer of the stock by X Corporation to E, because disposition of the  stock was made by E within two years from the date the options were  granted and within one year of the date that the shares were transferred  to him.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume  that E dies on September 1, 2005, owning the 100 shares of X Corporation  stock acquired by him pursuant to his exercise on June 1, 2005, of the  statutory option. On the date of death, the fair market value of the  stock is $12,500. No income is realized by E by reason of the transfer  of the 100 shares to his estate. If the stock is valued as of the date  of E's death for estate tax purposes, the basis of the 100 shares in the  hands of the executor is $12,500.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except assume  that on June 1, 2005, when the option is exercised by E the 100 shares  are transferred by X to E and his wife W, as joint owners with right of  survivorship, and that E dies on July 1, 2005. Neither the transfer into  joint ownership nor the termination of such joint ownership by E's death  is a disposition. Because E has made no disqualifying disposition of the  shares, section 421(a) is applicable and E realizes no compensation  income at death with respect to the shares even though he held the stock  less than 2 years after the transfer of the shares to him pursuant to  his exercise of the option. See Sec. 1.421-2(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. On January 1, 2004, X Corporation grants to E, an  employee of X Corporation, an incentive stock option to purchase 100  shares of X Corporation stock at $100 per share (the fair market value  of an X Corporation share on that date). On January 1, 2005, when the  fair market value of a share of X Corporation stock is $200, E exercises  half of the option, pays X Corporation $5,000 in cash, and is  transferred 50 shares of X Corporation stock with an aggregate fair  market value of $10,000. E makes no disposition of the shares before  January 2, 2006. Under Sec. 1.421-2(a), no income is recognized by E on  the transfer of shares pursuant to the exercise of the incentive stock  option, and X Corporation is not entitled to any deduction at any time  with respect to its transfer of the shares to E. E's basis in the shares  is $5,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except that on  December 1, 2005, one year and 11 months after the grant of the option  and 11 months after the transfer of the 50 shares to E, E uses 25 of  those shares, with a fair market value of $5,000, to pay for the  remaining 50 shares purchasable under the option. On that day, X  Corporation transfers 50 of its shares, with an aggregate fair market  value of $10,000, to E. Because E disposed of the 25 shares before the  expiration of the applicable holding periods, Sec. 1.421-2(a) does not  apply to the January 1, 2005, transfer of the 25 shares used by E to  exercise the remainder of the option. As a result of the disqualifying  disposition of the 25 shares, E recognizes compensation income under the  rules of Sec. 1.421-2(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. On January 1, 2005, X Corporation grants an incentive  stock option to E, an employee of X Corporation. The exercise price of  the option is $10 per share. On June 1, 2005, when the fair market value  of an X Corporation share is $20, E exercises the option and purchases 5  shares with an aggregate fair market value of $100. On January 1, 2006,  when the fair market value of an X Corporation share is $50, X  Corporation is acquired by Y Corporation in a section 368(a)(1)(A)  reorganization. As part of the acquisition, all X Corporation shares are  converted into Y Corporation shares. After the conversion, if an  optionee holds a fractional share of Y Corporation stock, Y Corporation  will purchase the fractional share for cash equal to its fair market  value. After applying the conversion formula to the shares held by E, E  has 10 \1/2\ Y Corporation shares. Y Corporation purchases E's one-half  share for $25, the fair market value of one-half of a Y Corporation  share on the conversion date. Because E sells the one-half share prior   to expiration of the holding periods described in Sec. 1.422-1(a), the  sale is a disqualifying disposition of the one-half share. Thus, in  2006, E must recognize compensation income of $5 (one-half of the fair  market value of an X Corporation share on the date of exercise of the  option, or $10, less one-half of the exercise price per share, or $5).  For purposes of computing any additional gain, E's basis in the one-half  share increases to $10 (reflecting the $5 included in income as  compensation). E recognizes an additional gain of $15 ($25, the fair  market value of the one-half share, less $10, the basis in such share).  The extent to which the additional $15 of gain is treated as a  redemption of Y Corporation stock is determined under section 302.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>, shares of the employer corporation or of a  related corporation that are owned (directly or indirectly) by or for  the individual's brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half  blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants, are considered to be  owned by the individual.

Sec. 1.421-1 through 1.424-1 the term  modification means any change in the terms of the option (or change in  the terms of the plan pursuant to which the option was granted or in the  terms of any other agreement governing the arrangement) that gives the  optionee additional benefits under the option regardless of whether the  optionee in fact benefits from the change in terms. In contrast, for  example, a change in the terms of the option shortening the period  during which the option is exercisable is not a modification. However, a  change providing an extension of the period during which an option may  be exercised (such as after termination of employment) or a change  providing an alternative to the exercise of the option (such as a stock  appreciation right) is a modification regardless of whether the optionee  in fact benefits from such extension or alternative right. Similarly, a  change providing an additional benefit upon exercise of the option (such  as the payment of a cash bonus) or a change providing more favorable  terms for payment for the stock purchased under the option (such as the  right to tender previously acquired stock) is a modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an option is not immediately exercisable in full, a change  in the terms of the option to accelerate the time at which the option  (or any portion thereof) may be exercised is not a modification for  purposes of this section. Additionally, no modification occurs if a  provision accelerating the time when an option may first be exercised is  removed prior to the year in which it would otherwise be triggered.   For example, if an acceleration provision is timely removed to avoid  exceeding the $100,000 limitation described in Sec. 1.422-4, a  modification of the option does not occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change to an option which provides, either by its terms or  in substance, that the optionee may receive an additional benefit under  the option at the future discretion of the grantor, is a modification at  the time that the option is changed to provide such discretion. In  addition, the exercise of discretion to provide an additional benefit is  a modification of the option. However, it is not a modification for the  grantor to exercise discretion specifically reserved under an option  with respect to the payment of a cash bonus at the time of exercise, the  availability of a loan at exercise, the right to tender previously  acquired stock for the stock purchasable under the option, or the  payment of employment taxes and/or required withholding taxes resulting  from the exercise of a statutory option. An option is not modified  merely because an optionee is offered a change in the terms of an option  if the change to the option is not made. An offer to change the terms of  an option that remains open less than 30 days is not a modification of  the option. However, if an offer to change the terms of an option  remains outstanding for 30 days or more, there is a modification of the  option as of the date the offer to change the option is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A change in the terms of the stock purchasable under the option  that increases the value of the stock is a modification of such option,  except to the extent that a new option is substituted for such option by  reason of the change in the terms of the stock in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If an option is amended solely to increase the number of shares  subject to the option, the increase is not considered a modification of  the option but is treated as the grant of a new option for the  additional shares. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the  exercise price and number of shares subject to an option are  proportionally adjusted to reflect a stock split (including a reverse  stock split) or stock dividend, and the only effect of the stock split  or stock dividend is to increase (or decrease) on a pro rata basis the  number of shares owned by each shareholder of the class of stock subject  to the option, then the option is not modified if it is proportionally  adjusted to reflect the stock split or stock dividend and the aggregate  exercise price of the option is not less than the aggregate exercise  price before the stock split or stock dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any change in the terms of an option made in an attempt to  qualify the option as a statutory option grants additional benefits to  the optionee and is, therefore, a modification. However, if the terms of  an option are changed to provide that the optionee cannot transfer the  option except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution in  order to meet the requirements of section 422(b)(5) or 423(b)(9) such  change is not a modicication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An extension of an option refers to the granting by the  corporation to the optionee of an additional period of time within which  to exercise the option beyond the time originally prescribed. A renewal  of an option is the granting by the corporation of the same rights or  privileges contained in the original option on the same terms and  conditions. The rules of this paragraph apply as well to successive  modifications, extensions, and renewals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any inadvertent change to the terms of an option (or change  in the terms of the plan pursuant to which the option was granted or in  the terms of any other agreement governing the arrangement) that is  treated as a modification under this paragraph (e) is not considered a  modification of the option to the extent the change in the terms of the  option is removed by the earlier of the date the option is exercised or  the last day of the calendar year during which such change occurred.  Thus, for example, if the terms of an option are inadvertently changed  on March 1 to extend the exercise period and the change is removed on  November, then if the option is not exercised prior to November 1, the  option is not considered modified under this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A statutory option may, as a result of a modification,  extension, or renewal, thereafter cease to be a statutory option, or any  option may, by   modification, extension, or renewal, thereafter become a statutory  option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the rules  regarding the plan provisions that are taken into account in making  these determinations, and paragraph (e) of this section provides rules  on the plan population that is taken into account for this purpose.

Thus,  the plan's funding target and target normal cost are computed separately  for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a  multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply  (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the  election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430  and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were  employed by a single employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(iii)</em> of this  section, the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year is the  present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits  under the plan that accrue during, are earned during, or are otherwise  allocated to service for the plan year under the applicable rules of  this section, including paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)(B)</em>, (C), or (D) of this  section.

The benefits that are allocated to the plan year under  the rules of paragraph (c) of this section include any increase in  benefits during the plan year that is attributable to increases in  compensation for the current plan year even if that increase in benefits  is with respect to benefits attributable to service performed in a  preceding plan year.

If section 430 does not apply for purposes  of determining the plan's minimum required contribution for a plan year  that begins on or after January 1, 2008 (as is the case for a plan  described in section 104, 105, or 106 of the Pension Protection Act of  2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780)), then the funding  target attainment percentage is determined for that plan year in  accordance with the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in the  same manner as for a plan to which section 430 applies to determine the  plan's minimum required contribution, except that the value of plan  assets that forms the numerator under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this  section is determined without subtraction of the funding standard  carryover balance or the credit balance under the funding standard  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for plans with zero funding target. If the  funding target of   the plan is equal to zero for a plan year, then the funding target  attainment percentage under this paragraph (b)(3) is equal to 100  percent for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Present value. The present value of a benefit (including a  portion of a benefit) with respect to a participant that is taken into  account under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section is determined  as of the valuation date by multiplying the amount of that benefit by  the probability that the benefit will be paid at a future date and then  discounting the resulting product using the appropriate interest rate  under Sec. 1.430(h)(2)-1. The probability that the benefit will be paid  with respect to the participant at such future date is determined using  the actuarial assumptions that satisfy the standards of paragraph (f) of  this section as to the probability of future service, advancement in  age, and other events (such as death, disability, termination of  employment, and selection of optional form of benefit) that affect  whether the participant or beneficiary will be eligible for the benefit  and whether the benefit will be paid at that future date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Benefits taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefits earned  or accrued. The benefits taken into account in determining the target  normal cost and the funding target under paragraph (b) of this section  are all benefits earned or accrued under the plan that have not yet been  paid as of the valuation date, including retirement-type and ancillary  benefits (within the meaning of Sec. 1.411(d)-3(g)). The benefits taken  into account are based on the participant's or beneficiary's status  (such as active employee, vested or partially vested terminated  employee, or disabled participant) as of the valuation date, and those  benefits are allocated to the funding target or the target normal cost  under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. To the extent that the  amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is a  function of the accrued benefit, the allocation of the benefit for  purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is  made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. To the  extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be  paid is not a function of the accrued benefit, but is a function of the  participant's years of service (or is the excess of a function of the  participant's years of service over a function of the participant's  accrued benefit), the allocation of the benefit for purposes of  determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using  the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. To the extent that  the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is not  allocated under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this  section, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the  funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of  paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, then the  portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in the  funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to  the accrued benefit as of the first day of the plan year, and the  portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the  target normal cost for the plan year is determined by applying that  function to the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year.  For example, a benefit that is assumed to be payable at a particular  early retirement age in the amount of 90 percent of the accrued benefit  is taken into account in the funding target in the amount of 90 percent  of the accrued benefit as of the beginning of the plan year, and that  benefit is taken into account in the target normal cost in the amount of  90 percent of the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, then the portion  of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in determining the  funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to  the participant's years of   service as of the first day of the plan year, and the portion of the  benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost  for the plan year is determined by applying that function to the  increase in the participant's years of service during the plan year. For  example, if a plan provides a post-retirement death benefit of $500 per  year of service, then the funding target is determined based on a death  benefit of $500 multiplied by a participant's years of service at the  beginning of the year, and if the participant earns or is expected to  earn a full year of service during the plan year, the target normal cost  is based on the additional $500 in death benefits attributable to that  additional year of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>, then the portion of a participant's  benefit that is taken into account in determining the funding target for  a plan year is equal to the total benefit multiplied by the ratio of the  participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year to  the years of service the participant will have at the time of the event  that causes the benefit to be payable (whether the benefit is expected  to be paid at the time of that decrement or at a future time), and the  portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the  target normal cost for the plan year is the increase in the  proportionate benefit attributable to the increase in the participant's  years of service during the plan year. For example, if a plan provides a  Social Security supplement for a participant who retires after 30 years  of service that is equal to a participant's Social Security benefit, the  funding target with respect to the benefit payable beginning at a  particular age (which reflects the probability of retirement at that  age) is determined based on the projected Social Security benefit  payable at the particular age multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the participant's years of service as of the first day of the  plan year and the denominator of which is the participant's projected  years of service at the particular age. In such a case, if the  participant earns or is expected to earn a full year of service during  the plan year, the target normal cost is determined based on the  projected Social Security benefit payable at the particular age  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the  denominator of which is the participant's projected years of service at  the particular age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of section 436 limitations to funding target and  target normal cost determination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Effect of limitation on  unpredictable contingent event benefits. The determination of the  funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must  take into account any limitation on unpredictable contingent event  benefits under section 436(b) with respect to unpredictable contingent  events which occurred before the valuation date, but must not take into  account anticipated funding-based limitations on unpredictable  contingent event benefits under section 436(b) with respect to  unpredictable contingent events which are expected to occur on or after  the valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of limitation on applicability of plan amendments. See  paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding the treatment of plan  amendments that take effect during the plan year taking into account the  restrictions under section 436(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effect of limitation on prohibited payments. The determination  of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan  year must take into account any limitation on prohibited payments under  section 436(d) with respect to any annuity starting date that was before  the valuation date, but must not take into account any limitation on  prohibited payments under section 436(d) for any annuity starting date  on or after the valuation date (however, the determination must take  into account benefit distributions under plan provisions that allow new  annuity starting dates with respect to distributions that were limited  under section 436(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>, the determination of the  funding target of a   plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on benefit  accruals under section 436(e) applicable before the valuation date.  However, if the plan terms provide for the automatic restoration of  benefit accruals as permitted under Sec. 1.436-1(a)(4)(ii)(B), and the  restoration of benefits as of the valuation date will not be treated as  resulting from a plan amendment under the rules of Sec. 1.436-1(c)(3)  (because the period of limitation as of the valuation date does not  exceed 12 months and the adjusted funding target attainment percentage  for the plan would not be less than 60 percent taking into account the  restored benefit accruals), then the determination of the funding target  of a plan for a plan year must not take into account the limitation on  benefit accruals under section 436(e) for that period. The determination  of the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must not take into  account any limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e). Thus,  if an employer wishes to take a plan freeze into account in determining  the target normal cost, the plan must be specifically amended to cease  accruals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effect of other limitations of benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Liquidity  shortfalls. The determination of the funding target and the target  normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any  restrictions on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a  liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 430(j)(4)) for periods  preceding the valuation date. The determination of the funding target  and the target normal cost must not take into account any restrictions  on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a liquidity shortfall  or possible liquidity shortfall for any period on or after the valuation  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> High 25 limitation. The determination of the funding target and  the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account  any restrictions on payments under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly  compensated employees to the extent that benefits were not paid or will  not be paid because of a limitation that applied prior to the valuation  date. If a benefit that was otherwise restricted was paid prior to the  valuation date but with suitable security (such as an escrow account)  provided to the plan in the event of a plan termination, the benefit is  treated as distributed for purposes of section 430 and this section.  Accordingly, the funding target does not include any liability for the  benefit and the plan assets do not include the security. The  determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan  for a plan year must not take into account any restrictions on payments  under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly compensated employees that are  anticipated with respect to annuity starting dates on or after the  valuation date on account of the funded status of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefits provided by insurance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A plan  generally is required to reflect in the plan's funding target and target  normal cost the liability for benefits that are funded through insurance  contracts held by the plan, and to include the corresponding insurance  contracts in plan assets. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section sets  forth an alternative to this general approach. A plan's treatment of  benefits funded through insurance contracts pursuant to this paragraph  (c)(2) is part of the plan's funding method. Accordingly, that treatment  can be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate funding of insured benefits. As an alternative to the  treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, in the case  of benefits that are funded through insurance contracts, the liability  for benefits provided under such contracts is permitted to be excluded  from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided that the  corresponding insurance contracts are excluded from plan assets. This  treatment is only available with respect to insurance purchased from an  insurance company licensed under the laws of a State and only to the  extent that a participant's or beneficiary's right to receive those  benefits is an irrevocable contractual right under the insurance  contracts, based on premiums paid to the insurance company prior to the  valuation date. For example, in the case of a retired participant  receiving benefits from an annuity contract in pay status under which no  premiums are required on or after the   valuation date, the liability for benefits provided by the contract is  permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target provided that  the value of the contract is also excluded from the value of plan  assets. Similarly, in the case of an active or deferred vested  participant whose benefits are funded by a life insurance or annuity  contract under which further premiums are required on or after the  valuation date, the liability for benefits, if any, that would be paid  from the contract if no further premiums were to be paid (for example,  if the contract were to go on reduced paid-up status) is permitted to be  excluded from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided  that the value of the contract is excluded from the value of plan  assets. By contrast, if the plan trustee can surrender a contract to the  insurer for its cash value, then the participant's or beneficiary's  right to receive those benefits is not an irrevocable contractual right  and, therefore, the liability for benefits provided under the contract  must be taken into account in determining the plan's funding target and  target normal cost and the contracts cannot be excluded from plan  assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Plan provisions taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plan  provisions adopted by valuation date. Except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (d), a plan's funding target and target normal cost for a  plan year are determined based on plan provisions that are adopted no  later than the valuation date for the plan year and that take effect on  or before the last day of the plan year. For example, in the case of a  plan amendment adopted on or before the valuation date for the plan year  that has an effective date occurring in the current plan year, the plan  amendment is taken into account in determining the funding target and  the target normal cost for the current plan year if it is permitted to  take effect under the rules of section 436(c) for the current plan year,  but the amendment is not taken into account for the current plan year if  it does not take effect until a future plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan provisions adopted after valuation date. If a plan  administrator makes the election described in section 412(d)(2) with  respect to a plan amendment, then the plan amendment is treated as  having been adopted on the first day of the plan year for purposes of  this paragraph (d). Section 412(d)(2) applies to any plan amendment  adopted no later than 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year,  including an amendment adopted during the plan year. Thus, if an  amendment is adopted after the valuation date for a plan year (and no  later than 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year), but takes  effect by the last day of the plan year, the amendment is taken into  account in determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost  for the plan year if the plan administrator makes the election described  in section 412(d)(2) with respect to such amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of when an amendment takes effect. For purposes  of this paragraph (d)(1), the determination of whether an amendment that  increases benefits takes effect and when it takes effect is determined  in accordance with the rules of section 436(c) and Sec. 1.436-1(c)(5).  For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), in the case of an amendment that  decreases benefits, the amendment takes effect under a plan on the first  date on which the benefits of any individual who is or could be a  participant or beneficiary under the plan would be less than those  benefits would be under the pre-amendment plan provisions if the  individual were on that date to satisfy the applicable conditions for  the benefits. In either case, the determination of when an amendment  takes effect is unaffected by an election under section 412(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for certain amendments increasing liabilities. In  the case of a plan amendment that is not required to be taken into  account under the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because it  is adopted after the valuation date for the plan year, the plan  amendment must be taken into account in determining a plan's funding  target and target normal cost for the plan year if the plan amendment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Takes effect by the last day of the plan year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of increases in  benefits,   establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or  changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Would not be permitted to take effect under the rules of  section 436(c) if those rules were applied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By treating the increase in the target normal cost for the plan  year attributable to the amendment (and all other amendments that must  be taken into account solely because of the application of the rules in  this paragraph (d)(2)) as if the increase were an increase in the  funding target for the plan year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By taking into account all unpredictable contingent event  benefits permitted to be paid for unpredictable contingent events that  occurred during the current plan year and all plan amendments that took  effect in the current plan year (including all amendments to which this  paragraph (d)(2) applies for the plan year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation of benefits attributable to plan amendments. If a  plan amendment is taken into account for a plan year under the rules of  this paragraph (d), then the allocation of benefits that is used to  determine the funding target and the target normal cost for that plan  year is based on the plan as amended. Thus, if an amendment that is  taken into account for a plan year increases a participant's accrued  benefit for service prior to the beginning of the plan year, then the  present value of that increase is included in the funding target for the  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Plan population taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In making  any determination of the funding target or target normal cost under  paragraph (b) of this section, the plan population is determined as of  the valuation date. The plan population must include three classes of  individuals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Participants currently employed in the service of the employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participants who are retired under the plan or who are  otherwise no longer employed in the service of the employer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All other individuals currently entitled to benefits under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assumption regarding rehiring of former employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special  exclusion for ``rule of parity'' cases. Certain individuals may be  excluded from the class of individuals described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)  of this section. The excludable individuals are those former employees  who, prior to the valuation date for the plan year, have terminated  service with the employer without vested benefits and whose service  might be taken into account in future years because the ``rule of  parity'' of section 411(a)(6)(D) does not permit that service to be  disregarded. However, if the plan's experience as to separated employees  returning to service has been such that the exclusion described in this  paragraph (e)(2) would be unreasonable, then no such exclusion is  permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application to partially vested participants. Whether former  employees who are terminated with partially vested benefits are assumed  to return to service is determined under the same rules that apply to  former employees without vested benefits under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anticipated future participants. In making any determination of  the funding target or target normal cost under paragraph (b) of this  section, the actuarial assumptions and funding method used for the plan  must not anticipate the affiliation with the plan of future participants  not employed in the service of the employer on the plan's valuation  date. However, any such determination may anticipate the affiliation  with the plan of current employees who have not yet satisfied the  participation (age and service) requirements of the plan as of the  valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Actuarial assumptions and funding method used in determination  of present value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Selection of actuarial assumptions and funding  method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rules. The determination of any present value or  other computation under section 430 and this section must be made on the  basis of actuarial assumptions and a funding method. Except as otherwise  specifically provided (for example, in Sec. 1.430(h)(2)-1(b)(6) or  section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  of 1974, as amended (ERISA)), the same actuarial assumptions and funding  method must be used for all computations   under sections 430 and 436. For example, the actuarial assumptions and  the funding method used in making a certification of the adjusted  funding target attainment percentage for a plan year must be the same as  those disclosed on the actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB,  ``Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information'' of Form  5500, ``Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in actuarial assumptions and funding method. Actuarial  assumptions established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed  for that plan year unless the Commissioner determines that the  assumptions that were used are unreasonable. Similarly, a funding method  established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed for that plan  year unless the Commissioner determines that the use of that funding  method for that plan year is impermissible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedures for establishing actuarial assumptions and funding  method. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), in the case of a plan for  which an actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB of Form 5500)  is required to be filed for a plan year, actuarial assumptions and the  funding method are established by the filing of the actuarial report if  it is filed no later than the due date (with extensions) for the report.  In the case of a plan for which an actuarial report for a plan year is  not required to be filed, actuarial assumptions and the funding method  are established by the delivery of the completed report to the employer  if it is delivered no later than what would be the due date (with  extensions) for filing the actuarial report were such a filing required.  If the actuarial report is not filed or delivered by the applicable date  described in the two preceding sentences, then the same actuarial  assumptions (such as the same interest rate and mortality table  elections) and funding method as were used for the preceding plan year  apply for all computations under sections 430 and 436 for the current  plan year, unless the Commissioner permits or requires other actuarial  assumptions or another funding method permitted under section 430 to be  used for the current plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Scope of funding method. A plan's funding method includes not  only the overall funding method used by the plan but also each specific  method of computation used in applying the overall method. However, the  choice of which actuarial assumptions are appropriate to the overall  method or to the specific method of computation is not a part of the  funding method. The assumed earnings rate used for purposes of  determining the actuarial value of assets under section 430(g)(3)(B) is  treated as an actuarial assumption, rather than as part of the funding  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>-1 set forth the interest rates, and section 430(h)(3) and  Sec. Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1 and 1.430(h)(3)-2 set forth the mortality  tables, that must be used for purposes of determining any present value  under this section. However, notwithstanding the requirement to use the  mortality tables, in the case of a plan which has fewer than 100  participants and beneficiaries who are not in pay status, the actuarial  assumptions may assume no pre-retirement mortality, but only if that  assumption would be a reasonable assumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, and 430(i)) must, in combination, offer the plan's  enrolled actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the  plan based on information determined as of the valuation date.

This paragraph (f)(4) provides rules relating to  the probability that benefit payments will be paid as single sums or  other optional forms under a plan and the impact of that probability on  the determination of the present value of those benefit payments under  section 430.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rules of application. Any determination of present  value or any other computation under this section must take into  account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The probability that future benefit payments under the plan will  be made in the form of any optional form of benefit provided under the  plan (including single-sum distributions), determined on the basis of  the plan's experience and other related assumptions, in accordance with  paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any difference in the present value of future benefit payments  that results from the use of actuarial assumptions in determining the  amount of benefit payments in any such optional form of benefit that are  different from those prescribed by section 430(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Single-sum and similar distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Distributions using  section 417(e) assumptions. In the case of a distribution that is  subject to section 417(e)(3) and that is determined using the applicable  interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3),  for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, the  computation of the present value of that distribution is treated as  having taken into account any difference in present value that results  from the use of actuarial assumptions that are different from those  prescribed by section 430(h) (as required under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B)  of this section) if and only if the present value of the distribution is  determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Substitution of annuity form. Except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), the present value of a distribution is  determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) if that present  value is determined as the present value, using special actuarial  assumptions, of the annuity (either the deferred or immediate annuity)  which is used under the plan to determine the amount of the  distribution. Under these special assumptions, for the period beginning  with the expected annuity starting date for the distribution, the  current applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would  apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the  valuation date is substituted for the mortality table under section  430(h)(3) that would otherwise be used. In addition, under these special  assumptions, the valuation interest rates under section 430(h)(2) are  used for purposes of discounting the projected annuity payments from  their expected payment dates to the valuation date (as opposed to the  interest rates under section 417(e)(3) which the plan uses to determine  the amount of the benefit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Optional application of generational mortality and phase-in of  interest rates. In determining the present value of a distribution under  this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), if a plan uses the generational mortality  tables under Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) or Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-2, the plan  is permitted to use a 50-50 male-female blend of the annuitant mortality  rates under the Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) generational mortality tables  in lieu of the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that  would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on  the valuation date. Similarly, a plan is permitted to make adjustments  to the interest rates in order to reflect differences between the phase- in of the section 430(h)(2) segment rates under section 430(h)(2)(G) and  the adjustments to the segment rates under section 417(e)(3)(D)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> applies, for example, where a distribution that  is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined as the greater of the  benefit determined using the applicable interest rates and the  applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) and the benefit  determined using some other basis, or where the amount of a distribution  that is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined using an interest  rate other than the applicable interest rates as required under section  415(b)(2)(E)(ii) (see Sec. 1.417(e)-1(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Distributions from applicable defined benefit plans under  section 411(a)(13)(C)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of an applicable  defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount  of a future distribution is based on an interest adjustment applied to  the current accumulated benefit, then the amount of that distribution is  determined by projecting the future interest credits or equivalent  amount under the plan's interest crediting rules using actuarial  assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this  section. Thus, if a plan provides for a single-sum distribution equal to  the balance of a participant's hypothetical account under a cash balance  plan, then the amount of that future distribution is equal to the  projected account balance at the expected date of payment determined  using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annuity distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule.

Section 430 and this section apply to single  employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans) that  are subject to section 412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as  defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth  rules regarding a plan's prefunding balance and a plan sponsor's  election to maintain a funding standard carryover balance. Paragraph (c)  of this section provides rules under which those balances must be  subtracted from plan assets. Paragraph (d) of this section describes a  plan sponsor's election to use those balances to offset the minimum  required contribution. Paragraph (e) of this section describes a plan  sponsor's election to reduce those balances (which will affect the  determination of the value of plan assets for purposes of sections 430  and 436). Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth rules regarding  elections under this section. Paragraph (g) of this section contains  examples.

After that date, the  funding standard carryover balance is decreased to the extent provided  in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and adjusted further for  investment return and interest as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and  (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Decreases.

If the election to use  all or a portion of the prefunding balance or the funding standard  carryover balance to satisfy the required installments under section  430(j)(3) is made after the due date for the required installment, then  the amount used to offset the minimum required contribution for the plan  year is the portion of the balance so used, discounted from the date of  the election to the due date of the required installment at the  effective interest rate plus 5 percentage points, and then further  discounted from the installment due date to the valuation date at the  effective interest rate. For example, if a quarterly installment of  $20,250 is due on April 15 for a calendar year plan with a valuation  date on January 1 and an effective interest rate of 6 percent, and the  installment is satisfied by an election to apply the funding standard  carryover balance that is made on July 1 (2\1/2\; months after the April  15 due date), then the amount used to offset the minimum required  contribution under this paragraph (d)(1)(i) is $19,481 (that is, $20,250  / 1.11(\2.5/12\) / 1.06(\3.5/12\).

In general, the  amount of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances that may be  used to offset the minimum required contribution for a plan year must  take into account any decrease in those balances which results from a  prior election either to use the prefunding balance or funding standard  carryover balance under section 430(f)(3) and this paragraph (d) or to  reduce those balances under section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this  section (including deemed elections under section 436(f)(3) and Sec.  1.436-1(a)(5)). For example, for a calendar plan year with a January 1  valuation date, a deemed election under section 436(f)(3) and Sec.  1.436-1(a)(5) on April 1, 2010 (the first day of the 4th month of the  plan year) will reduce the available prefunding balance or funding  standard carryover balance that can be used with respect to an election  made after April 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception to chronological rule. Notwithstanding the general  rule of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all elections under  section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section to reduce the  prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for the current  plan year (including deemed elections under section 436(f)(3) and Sec.  1.436-1(a)(5)) are deemed to occur on the valuation date for the plan  year and before any election under section 430(f)(3) and this paragraph  (d) to offset the minimum required contribution for the current plan  year. Accordingly, if an election to use the prefunding balance or  funding standard carryover balance to offset the minimum required  contribution for the plan year (including an election to satisfy the  quarterly contribution requirement) has been made prior to the election  to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance,  then the amount available for use to offset the otherwise applicable  minimum required contribution for the plan year under this paragraph (d)  will be retroactively reduced. However, an election to reduce a  prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance for a plan year  does not affect a prior election to use a prefunding balance or funding  standard carryover balance to offset a minimum required contribution for  a prior plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Investment experience. In addition to reflecting any decrease in  the prefunding balance or the funding standard carryover balance which  results from a prior election for the previous year either to use the  prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance under section  430(f)(3) and this paragraph (d) to offset the minimum required  contribution for such prior plan year or to reduce those balances under  section 430(f)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section (including deemed  elections under section 436(f)(3) and Sec. 1.436-1(a)(5)), the prior  plan year's prefunding and funding standard carryover balances must be  adjusted under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section for  investment experience for that prior plan year before determining the  amount of those balances available for such an election for the current  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>. Thus, the amount used to offset the  minimum required contribution for the earlier plan year is subtracted  from the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance as of  the valuation date for that year prior to the adjustment for investment  return under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for that plan year, and  the amount by which the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover  balance is decreased for the second year is based on the elections made  for the second year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirement to use funding standard carryover balance before  prefunding   balance. To the extent that a plan has a funding standard carryover  balance greater than zero, no amount of the plan's prefunding balance  may be used to offset the minimum required contribution.

An election to  use the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance to  offset the minimum required contribution under this paragraph (d) is not  available for a plan year if the plan's prior plan year funding ratio is  less than 80 percent.

To the extent that a plan has a funding standard  carryover balance greater than zero, no election under paragraph (e)(1)  of this section is permitted to be made that reduces the plan's  prefunding balance.

For this purpose, an  election to add to the prefunding balance relates to the plan year for  which excess contributions were made. For example, an election to add to  the prefunding balance as of the first day of the plan year that begins  on January 1, 2010 (in an amount not in excess of the present value of  the excess contribution as of the valuation date in 2009, adjusted for  interest under the rules of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), must  be made no later than September 15, 2010, even though the election is  reported on the 2010 Schedule SB of Form 5500, which is not due until  2011.

The deadline for revoking the  election described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section is generally  the end of the plan year. However, for plans with a valuation date other  than the first day of the plan year, the deadline for the revocation is  the deadline for contributions for the plan year as described in section  430(j)(1). In addition, for the first plan year beginning in 2008, the  deadline for the revocation for all plans is deferred to the due date  (including extensions) of the Schedule SB, ``Single-Employer Defined  Benefit Plan Actuarial Information'' of Form 5500, ``Annual Return/ Report of Employee Benefit Plan''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plan sponsor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The sponsor  of Plan P, Sponsor S, does not elect to use any portion of the balance  to offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 pursuant to  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or to reduce any portion of the  funding standard carryover balance prior to the determination of the  value of plan assets for 2010, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this  section. The actual rate of return on Plan P's assets for 2010 is 2%.  Plan P's effective interest rate for 2010 is 6%. The minimum required  contribution for Plan P under section 430 for 2010 is $100,000, and no  quarterly installments are required for Plan P for the 2010 plan year.  As of January 1, 2010, the value of plan assets is $1,100,000 and the  funding target is $1,000,000. Therefore, the prior plan year funding  ratio for Plan P for 2010, as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this  section, is 110%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sponsor S makes a contribution to Plan P of $150,000 on  December 1, 2010, for the 2010 plan year and makes no other  contributions for the 2010 plan year.

In addition, on February 1, 2011, Sponsor S elects to use  $15,000 of the funding standard carryover balance to offset P's minimum  required contribution for 2010, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this  section.

The prefunding balance of Plan Q as  of the beginning of the 2010 plan year is $0. The actual rate of return  on Plan Q's assets for 2010 is 10%. Plan Q's effective interest rate for  2010 is 6.25%. The funding ratio for Plan Q for 2009 (the prior plan  year funding ratio with respect to 2010, as determined under paragraph  (d)(3) of this section) is 85%, which is not less than 80%. The minimum  required contribution for Plan Q for 2010 is $200,000. Sponsor T makes a  contribution to Plan Q of $190,000 on July 1, 2010, for the 2010 plan  year, and makes no other contributions for the 2010 plan year.

However, Sponsor T does not elect in 2010 to  reduce any portion of the funding standard carryover balance pursuant to  paragraph (e) of this section. The funding standard carryover balance  ($51,539) is subtracted from the value of plan assets, as of July 1,  2010, prior to the determination of the minimum funding contribution,  and $51,539 is the maximum amount that may applied against the minimum  required contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The value of the funding standard carryover balance as of  January 1, 2011, is determined by first discounting the amount used to  offset the minimum required contribution for 2010 from July 1, 2010, to  January 1, 2010, using the effective interest rate of 6.25%, and  subtracting the discounted amount from the January 1, 2010, funding  standard carryover balance. The resulting amount is adjusted for  investment experience to January 1, 2011, using a rate equal to the  actual rate of return on plan assets of 10% during 2010.

The remaining funding standard carryover balance as of January 1,  2010, solely for purposes of determining the adjustment for investment  experience during 2010, is $40,299 ($50,000--$9,701), and the adjustment  for investment experience is $4,030 ($40,299 x 10%).

Accordingly, the available  amount in Plan P's funding standard carryover balance as of January 1,  2012, is zero. The available amount in Plan P's prefunding balance as of  January 1, 2012, is $20,087 ($58,573 minus $39,800, increased by 7%).

This section provides rules relating  to a plan's valuation date and the valuation of a plan's assets for a  plan year under section 430(g). Section 430 and this section apply to  single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans  as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to the rules of section  412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section  414(f)). Paragraph (b) of this section describes valuation date rules.  Paragraph (c) of this section describes rules regarding the  determination of the asset value for purposes of a plan's actuarial  valuation. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules for taking  employer contributions into account in the determination of the value of  plan assets. Paragraph (e) of this section contains examples. Paragraph  (f) of this section sets forth effective/applicability dates and  transition rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for multiple employer plans. In the case of a  multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules  of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer  under the plan as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, in  such a case, the value of plan assets is determined separately for each  employer under the plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to  which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in  section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section  413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are  applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The determination of the funding  target, target normal cost, and value of plan assets for a plan year is  made as of the valuation date for that plan year. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the valuation date for any  plan year is the first day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, all defined  benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans as defined in section  414(f)) maintained by an employer are treated as one plan, but only  participants with respect to that employer are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer determination. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2),  the employer includes all members of the employer's controlled group  determined pursuant to section 414(b), (c), (m), and (o) and includes  any predecessor of the employer that, during the prior year, employed  any employees of the employer who are covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of exception in first plan year. In the case of  the first plan year of any plan, the exception for small plans under  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of   this section is applied by taking into account the number of  participants that the plan is reasonably expected to have on each day  during the first plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Valuation date is part of funding method. The selection of a  plan's valuation date is part of the plan's funding method and,  accordingly, may only be changed with the consent of the Commissioner. A  change of a plan's valuation date that is required by section 430 is  treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require  the Commissioner's prior specific approval. Thus, if a plan that ceases  to be eligible for the small plan exception under this paragraph (b)(2)  for a plan year because the number of participants exceeded 100 in the  prior plan year, then the resulting change in the valuation date to the  first day of the plan year is automatically approved by the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of asset value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General use of  fair market value. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c),  the value of plan assets for purposes of section 430 is equal to the  fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date. Prior year  contributions made after the valuation date and current year  contributions made before the valuation date are taken into account to  the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Averaging of fair market values--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Subject to the  plan asset corridor rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, a  plan is permitted to determine the value of plan assets on the valuation  date as the average of the fair market value of assets on the valuation  date and the adjusted fair market value of assets determined for one or  more earlier determination dates (adjusted using the method described in  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The method of determining the  value of assets is part of the plan's funding method and, accordingly,  may only be changed with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusted fair market value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determination dates. The period  of time between each determination date (treating the valuation date as  a determination date) must be equal and that period of time cannot  exceed 12 months. In addition, the earliest determination date with  respect to a plan year cannot be earlier than the last day of the 25th  month before the valuation date of the plan year (or a similar period in  the case of a valuation date that is not the first day of a month). In a  typical situation, the earlier determination dates will be the two  immediately preceding valuation dates. However, these rules also permit  the use of more frequent determination dates. For example, monthly or  quarterly determination dates may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjustments for contributions and distributions. The adjusted  fair market value of plan assets for a prior determination date is the  fair market value of plan assets on that date, increased for  contributions included in the plan's asset balance on the valuation date  that were not included in the plan's asset balance on the earlier  determination date, reduced for benefits and all other amounts paid from  plan assets during the period beginning with the prior determination  date and ending immediately before the valuation date, and adjusted for  expected earnings as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this  section. For this purpose, the fair market value of assets as of a  determination date includes any contribution for a plan year that ends  with or prior to the determination date that is receivable as of the  determination date (but only if the contribution is actually made within  8\1/2\ months after the end of the applicable plan year). If the  contribution that is receivable as of the determination date is for a  plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, then only the present  value as of the determination date (determined using the effective  interest rate under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year   for which the contribution is made) is included in the fair market value  of assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of spin-offs and plan-to-plan transfers. For purposes  of determining the adjusted fair market value of plan assets, assets  spun-off from a plan as a result of a spin-off described in Sec.  1.414(l)-1(b)(4) are treated as an amount paid from plan assets. Except  as otherwise provided by the Commissioner, for purposes of determining  the adjusted fair market value of plan assets, assets that are added to  a plan as a result of a plan-to-plan transfer described in Sec.  1.414(l)-1(b)(3) are treated in the same manner as contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Adjustments for expected earnings. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Assumed rate of return. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Limitation on the assumed rate of return for periods within plan  years for which the three segment rates were used. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Limitation on the assumed rate of return for periods within plan  years for which the full yield curve was used.

For purposes of this section, except as  otherwise provided under the transition rule of paragraph (h)(4) of this  section, the second segment rate is, with respect to any month, the  single rate of interest determined by the Commissioner on the basis of  the average of the monthly corporate bond yield curves (described in  paragraph (d) of this section) for the 24-month period ending with the  month preceding that month, taking into account only the portion of each  of those yield curves corresponding to the 15-year period that follows  the end of the 5-year period described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Third segment rate. For purposes of this section, except as  otherwise provided under the transition rule of paragraph (h)(4) of this  section, the third segment rate is, with respect to any month, the  single rate of interest determined by the Commissioner on the basis of  the average of the monthly corporate bond yield curves (described in  paragraph (d) of this section) for the 24-month period ending with the  month preceding that month, taking into account only the portion of each  of those yield curves corresponding to the 40-year period that follows  the end of the 15-year period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Monthly corporate bond yield curve--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

This paragraph (e) describes  elections for a plan year that a plan sponsor can make to use  alternative interest rates under this section. Any election under this  paragraph (e) must be made by providing written notification of the  election to the plan's enrolled actuary. Any election in this paragraph  (e) may be adopted for a plan year without obtaining the consent of the  Commissioner, but, once adopted, that election will apply for that plan  year and all future plan years and may be changed only with the consent  of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election for alternative applicable month. As an alternative to  defining the applicable month as the month that includes the valuation  date for the plan year, a plan sponsor that is using segment rates as  provided under paragraph (b) of this section may elect to use one of the  4 months preceding that month as the applicable month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election not to apply transition rule. The plan sponsor may  elect not to apply the transition rule in paragraph (h)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election to use full yield curve--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes  of determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost, and for  all other purposes under section 430 (including the determination of  shortfall amortization installments, waiver installments, and the  present values of those installments as described in paragraph (f)(2) of  this section), the plan sponsor may elect to use interest rates under  the monthly corporate bond yield curve described in paragraph (d) of  this section for the month preceding the month that includes the  valuation date in lieu of the segment rates determined under paragraph  (c) of this section. In order to address the timing of benefit payments  during a year, reasonable approximations are permitted to be used to  value benefit payments that are expected to be made during a plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reasonable techniques permitted. In the case of a plan sponsor  using the   monthly corporate bond yield curve under this paragraph (e)(4), if with  respect to a decrement the benefit is only expected to be paid for one- half of a year (because the decrement was assumed to occur in the middle  of the year), the interest rate for that year can be determined as if  the benefit were being paid for the entire year. See Sec. 1.430(d)- 1(f)(7) for additional reasonable techniques that can be used in  determining present value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plan sponsor. For purposes of the elections described in this  section, any reference to the plan sponsor generally means the employer  or employers responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.  In the case of plans that are multiple employer plans to which section  413(c)(4)(A) does not apply, any reference to the plan sponsor means the  plan administrator within the meaning of section 414(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Interest rates used for other purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effective interest  rate--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)  of this section, the effective interest rate determined under section  430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year is the single interest rate that, if used  to determine the present value of the benefits that are taken into  account in determining the plan's funding target for the plan year,  would result in an amount equal to the plan's funding target determined  for the plan year under section 430(d) as described in Sec. 1.430(d)- 1(b)(2) (without regard to calculations for plans in at-risk status  under section 430</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Zero funding target. If, for the plan year, the plan's funding  target is equal to zero, then the effective interest rate determined  under section 430(h)(2)(A) for the plan year is the single interest rate  that, if used to determine the present value of the benefits that are  taken into account in determining the plan's target normal cost for the  plan year, would result in an amount equal to the plan's target normal  cost determined for the plan year under section 430(b) as described in  Sec. 1.430(d)-1(b)(1) (without regard to calculations for plans in at- risk status under section 430(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the shortfall  amortization installments for a plan year are assumed to be paid on the  valuation date for that plan year. For example, for a plan that uses the  segment rates described in paragraph (c) of this section, the shortfall  amortization installment for the fifth plan year following the current  plan year (the sixth installment) is assumed to be paid on the valuation  date for that year so that such shortfall amortization installment will  be determined using the second segment rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The January 1, 2009, valuation of Plan P is performed  using the segment rates applicable for September 2008 (determined  without regard to the transition rule of section 430(h)(2)(G)), and the  2009 annuitant and nonannuitant (male and female) mortality tables as  published in Notice 2008-85. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) relating to  objectives and standards for publishing regulations, revenue rulings and  revenue procedures in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Plan P provides for  early retirement benefits as early as age 50, and offers a single-sum  distribution payable immediately at retirement. The single-sum payment  is equal to the present value of the participant's accrued benefit,  based on the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality  table under section 417(e)(3). Participant E is the only participant in  the plan, and is a male age 46 as of January 1, 2009, with an annual  accrued benefit of $23,000 payable beginning at age 65. The actuary  assumes a 100% probability that Participant E will terminate at age 50  and will elect to receive his benefit in the form of a single-sum  payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan P's funding target is $68,908 as of January 1, 2009. This  figure is based on the male nonannuitant rates for ages prior to age 50,  the applicable mortality rates under section 417(e)(3) for ages 50 and  later, and segment interest rates of 5.07% for the first 5 years after  the valuation date, 6.09% for the next 15 years, and 6.56% for periods  more than 20 years after the valuation date. (See Sec. 1.430(d)- 1(f)(9), Example 10, for additional details.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The present value of Participant E's benefits as of January 1,  2009, is $68,908 if a single interest rate of 6.52805% is substituted  for the segment interest rates but all other assumptions remain the  same. Thus (rounded), the effective interest rate for Plan P is 6.53%  for 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as for Example 1, except that  Plan P offers a single-sum distribution equal to the present value of  the accrued benefit based on the applicable interest rates under section  417(e)(3) or an interest rate of 6.25%, whichever produces the higher  amount. The applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) is used  for both calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The present value of Participant E's age-50 single-sum  distribution as of January 1, 2009 (when Participant E is age 46) is  $77,392. This amount is determined by calculating the projected single- sum distribution at age 50 using the applicable mortality table under  section 417(e)(3) and an interest rate of 6.25%, and discounting the  result to January 1, 2009, using the first segment rate of 5.07% and  male nonannuitant mortality rates for 2009. Because this amount is  larger than the present value of Participant E's single-sum payment  based on the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3) (that is,  $68,908), the funding target for Plan P is $77,392 as of January 1,  2009. (See Sec. 1.430(d)-1(f)(9), Example 12 for additional details.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The effective interest rate is the single interest rate that  will produce the same funding target if substituted for the segment  interest rates keeping all other assumptions the same, including the  fixed interest rate used by the plan to determine single-sum payments.  The only segment interest rate used to develop the funding target of  $77,392 was the first segment rate of 5.07%. Therefore, considering only  this calculation, the single interest rate that would produce the same  funding target would be 5.07%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> However, the effective interest rate must also reflect the fact  that the single-sum payment under Plan P is equal to the greater of the  present value of Participant E's accrued benefit based on the fixed rate  of 6.25% or the applicable interest rates under section 417(e)(3). If  the single rate of 5.07% is substituted for the segment rates used to  calculate the present value of the single-sum payment based on the  applicable interest rates, the resulting funding target would be higher  than $77,392.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Using a single interest rate of 6.0771%, the January 1, 2009,  present value of Participant E's single-sum payment based on the  applicable interest rates is $77,392, and the present value of  Participant E's single sum payment based on the plan's interest rate of  6.25% is $74,494. Plan P's funding target is the larger of the two, or  $77,392, which is the same as the funding target based on the segment  interest rates used for the 2009 valuation. Therefore, Plan P's  effective interest rate for 2009 (rounded) is 6.08%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability dates and transition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Statutory effective date/applicability date. Section 430 generally  applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.

This section sets  forth rules for the mortality tables to be used in determining present  value or making any computation under section 430. Generally applicable  mortality tables for participants and beneficiaries are set forth in  this section pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A). In lieu of using the  mortality tables provided under this section with respect to  participants and beneficiaries, plan-specific substitute mortality  tables are permitted to be used for this purpose pursuant to section  430(h)(3)(C) provided that the requirements of Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-2 are  satisfied. Mortality tables that may be used with respect to disabled  individuals are to be provided in guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin.

The generally  applicable mortality tables provided under section 430(h)(3)(A) are the  static tables described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and the  generational mortality tables described in paragraph (a)(4) of this  section. A plan is permitted to use either of those sets of mortality  tables with respect to participants and beneficiaries pursuant to this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Static tables. The static mortality tables that are permitted to  be used pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section are updated  annually to reflect expected improvements in mortality experience as  described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

The mortality tables  to be used with respect to valuation dates occurring in later years are  to be provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.  See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Generational mortality tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The generational  mortality tables that are permitted to be used pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2) of this section are determined pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4)  using the base mortality tables and projection factors set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section. Under the generational mortality tables,  the probability of an individual's death at a particular age is  determined as the individual's base mortality rate (that is, the  applicable mortality rate from the table set forth in paragraph (d) of  this section for the age for which the probability of death is being  determined) multiplied by the mortality improvement factor. The  mortality improvement factor is equal to (1-projection factor for that  age)\n\, where n is equal to the projection period. For this purpose,  the projection period is the number of years between 2000 and the year  for which the probability of death is being determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of calculation. As an example of the use of  generational mortality tables under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section,  for purposes of determining the probability of death at age 54 for a  male annuitant born in 1974, the base mortality rate is .005797, the  projection factor is .020, and the projection period (the period from  the year 2000 until the year the participant will attain age 54) is 28  years, so that the mortality improvement factor is   .567976, and the probability of death at age 54 is .003293. Similarly,  under these generational mortality tables, the probability of death at  age 55 for the same male annuitant would be determined by using the base  mortality rate and projection factor at age 55, and a projection period  of 29 years (the period from the year 2000 until the year the  participant will attain age 55). Thus, the base mortality rate is  .005905, the projection factor is .019, so that the mortality  improvement factor is .573325 ((1-.019)\29\), and the probability of  death at age 55 is .003385 (.573325 times .005905). Because these  generational mortality tables reflect expected improvements in mortality  experience, no periodic updates are needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of the tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Separate tables for annuitants and  nonannuitants--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Separate tables are provided for use for  annuitants and nonannuitants. The nonannuitant mortality table is  applied to determine the probability of survival for a nonannuitant for  the period before the nonannuitant is projected to commence receiving  benefits. The annuitant mortality table is applied to determine the  present value of benefits for each annuitant, and for each nonannuitant  for the period beginning when the nonannuitant is projected to commence  receiving benefits. For purposes of this section, an annuitant means a  plan participant who has commenced receiving benefits and a nonannuitant  means a plan participant who has not yet commenced receiving benefits  (for example, an active employee or a terminated vested participant). A  participant whose benefit has partially commenced is treated as an  annuitant with respect to the portion of the benefit which has commenced  and a nonannuitant with respect to the balance of the benefit. In  addition, for any period in which an annuitant is projected to be  receiving benefits, any beneficiary with respect to that annuitant is  also treated as an annuitant for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of calculation. As an example of the use of separate  annuitant and nonannuitant tables under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section, with respect to a 45-year-old active participant who is  projected to commence receiving an annuity at age 55, the funding target  would be determined using the nonannuitant mortality table for the  period before the participant attains age 55 (so that, if the static  mortality tables are used pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  the probability of an active male participant living from age 45 to age  55 using the table that applies for a plan year beginning in 2008 is  98.61%) and the annuitant mortality table for the period ages 55 and  above. Similarly, if a 45-year-old terminated vested participant is  projected to commence an annuity at age 65, the funding target would be  determined using the nonannuitant mortality table for the period before  the participant attains age 65 and the annuitant mortality table for  ages 65 and above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small plan tables. If static mortality tables are used pursuant  to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as an alternative to the separate  static tables specified for annuitants and nonannuitants pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a combined static table that applies  the same mortality rates to both annuitants and nonannuitants is  permitted to be used for a small plan. For this purpose, a small plan is  defined as a plan with 500 or fewer participants (including both active  and inactive participants) on the valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Construction of static tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Source of basic rates. The  static mortality tables that are used pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of  this section are based on the base mortality tables set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Projected mortality improvements. The mortality rates under the  base mortality tables are projected to improve using the projection  factors provided in Projection Scale AA, as set forth in paragraph (d)  of this section. Using these projection factors, the mortality rate for  an individual at each age is determined as the individual's base  mortality rate (that is, the applicable base mortality rate from the  table set forth in paragraph (d) of this section for the individual at  that age) multiplied by the mortality improvement factor. The mortality  improvement factor is equal to (1-projection factor for that age)\n\,  where n is equal   to the projection period. The annuitant mortality rates for a plan year  are determined using a projection period that runs from the calendar  year 2000 until 7 years after the calendar year that contains the  valuation date for the plan year. The nonannuitant mortality rates for a  plan year are determined using a projection period that runs from the  calendar year 2000 until 15 years after the calendar year that contains  the valuation date for the plan year. Thus, for example, for a plan year  with a January 1, 2012, valuation date, the annuitant mortality rates  are determined using a projection period that runs from 2000 until 2019  (19 years) and the nonannuitant mortality rates are determined using a  projection period that runs from 2000 until 2027 (27 years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Construction of combined tables for small plans. The combined  mortality tables that are permitted to be used for small plans pursuant  to paragraph (b)(2) of this section are constructed from the separate  nonannuitant and annuitant tables using the weighting factors for small  plans that are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The weighting  factors are applied to develop these mortality tables using the  following equation: Combined mortality rate = [nonannuitant rate \*\ (1- weighting factor)] + [annuitant rate \*\ weighting factor].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>  in connection with a plan-specific substitute mortality table.

class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/Applicability date. This section applies for plan  years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.  [T.D. 9419, 73 FR 44639, July 31, 2008]    Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-2  Plan-specific substitute mortality tables  used to determine present value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em>. In order to use substitute  mortality tables, a plan sponsor must obtain approval to use substitute  mortality tables for the plan in accordance with the procedures set  forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section  sets forth rules for the development of substitute mortality tables,  including guidelines for determining whether a plan has sufficient  credible mortality experience to use substitute mortality tables.  Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth special rules regarding the use  of substitute mortality tables. The Commissioner may, in revenue rulings  and procedures, notices or other guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter),  provide additional guidance regarding approval and use of substitute  mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(C) and related matters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for obtaining approval to use substitute mortality  tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Written request to use substitute mortality tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General requirements. In order to use substitute mortality tables, a  plan sponsor must submit a written request to the Commissioner that  demonstrates that those substitute mortality tables meet the  requirements of section 430(h)(3)(C) and this section. This request must  state the first plan year and the term of years (not more than 10) that  the tables are requested to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time for written request--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in  this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), substitute mortality tables cannot be used  for a plan year unless the plan sponsor submits the written request  described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section at least 7 months prior  to the first day of the first plan year for which the substitute  mortality tables are to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for requests submitted on or before October 1,  2007. Notwithstanding the rule of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this  section, the timing of the written request described in paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section does not prevent a plan from using substitute  mortality tables for a plan year provided that the written request is  submitted no later than October 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rule for requests submitted on or before October 1,  2008, with respect to plan years beginning during 2009. Notwithstanding  the rule of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the timing of the  written request described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does  not prevent a plan from using substitute mortality tables for a plan  year   that begins during 2009 provided that the written request is submitted  no later than October 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commissioner's review of request--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. During the  180-day period that begins on the date the plan sponsor submits a  request to use substitute mortality tables for a plan pursuant to this  section, the Commissioner will determine whether the request to use  substitute mortality tables satisfies the requirements of this section  (including any published guidance issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this section), and will either approve or deny the request. The  Commissioner will deny a request if the request fails to meet the  requirements of this section or if the Commissioner determines that a  substitute mortality table does not sufficiently reflect the mortality  experience of the applicable plan population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Request for additional information. The Commissioner may  request additional information with respect to the submission. Failure  to provide that information on a timely basis constitutes grounds for  denial of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deemed approval. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of  this section, if the Commissioner does not issue a denial within the  180-day review period, the request is deemed to have been approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Extension of time permitted. The Commissioner and a plan  sponsor may, before the expiration of the 180-day review period, agree  in writing to extend that period, provided that any such agreement also  specifies any revisions in the plan sponsor's request, including any  change in the requested term of use of the substitute mortality tables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Development of substitute mortality tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mortality  experience requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Substitute mortality tables  must reflect the actual mortality experience of the pension plan for  which the tables are to be used and that mortality experience must be  credible mortality experience as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of  this section. Separate mortality tables must be established for each  gender under the plan, and a substitute mortality table is permitted to  be established for a gender only if the plan has credible mortality  experience with respect to that gender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section, there are at least 1,000 deaths within that gender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gender without credible mortality experience--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  If, for the first year for which a plan uses substitute mortality  tables, one gender has credible mortality experience but the other  gender does not have credible mortality experience, the substitute  mortality tables are used for the gender that does have credible  mortality experience and the mortality tables under Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1  are used for the gender that does not have credible mortality  experience. For a subsequent plan year, the plan sponsor may continue to  use substitute mortality tables for the gender with credible mortality  experience without using substitute mortality tables for the other  gender only if the other gender continues to lack credible mortality  experience for that subsequent plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Demonstration of lack of credible mortality experience for a  gender. In general, in order to demonstrate that a gender within a plan  does not have credible mortality experience for a plan year, the  demonstration that the gender population within the plan has fewer than  1,000 deaths over a 4-year period must be made using a 4-year period  that ends less than 3 years before the first day of that plan year. For  example, if a plan uses substitute mortality tables based on credible  mortality experience obtained over a 4-year experience study period for  its male population and the standard mortality tables under Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-1 for its female population, there must be a demonstration  that the plan's female population does not have at least 1,000 deaths in  a 4-year period that ends less than 3 years before the first day of that  plan year. However, if the experience study period described in  paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section exceeds 4 years, then in order  to demonstrate that a gender within a plan does not have credible  mortality experience for a plan year, the mortality experience   of that population must be analyzed over a period that is the same  length as the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables  are based and that ends less than 3 years before the first day of that  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disabled individuals. Under section 430(h)(3)(D), separate  mortality tables are permitted to be used for certain disabled  individuals. If such separate mortality tables are used for those  disabled individuals, then those individuals are disregarded for all  purposes under this section. Thus, if the mortality tables under section  430(h)(3)(D) are used for disabled individuals under a plan, mortality  experience with respect to those individuals must be excluded in  developing mortality rates for substitute mortality tables under this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Base table and base year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Development of a  substitute mortality table under this section requires creation of a  base table and identification of a base year under this paragraph  (c)(2). The base table and base year are then used to determine a  substitute mortality table under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Experience study and base table requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  The base table for a plan population must be developed from an  experience study of the mortality experience of that plan population  that generates amounts-weighted mortality rates based on experience data  for the plan that is collected over an experience study period. The  minimum length of the experience study period is 2 years. The maximum  length of the experience study period is 5 years, but can be extended by  the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter). The last day of the final year  reflected in the experience data must be less than 3 years before the  first day of the first plan year for which the substitute mortality  tables are to apply. For example, if July 1, 2009, is the first day of  the first plan year for which the substitute mortality tables will be  used, then an experience study using calendar year data must include  data collected for a period that ends no earlier than December 31, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amounts-weighted mortality rates. The amounts-weighted mortality  rate for an age is equal to the quotient determined by dividing the sum  of the accrued benefits (or payable benefits, in the case of individuals  in pay status) for all individuals at that age at the beginning of the  year who died during the year, by the sum of the accrued benefits (or  payable benefits, in the case of individuals in pay status) for all  individuals at that age at the beginning of the year, with appropriate  adjustments for individuals who left the relevant plan population during  the year for reasons other than death. Because amounts-weighted  mortality rates for a plan cannot be determined without accrued (or  payable) benefits, the mortality experience study used to develop a base  table cannot include periods before the plan was established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Grouping of ages. Amounts-weighted mortality rates may be  derived from amounts-weighted mortality rates for age groups. The  Commissioner, in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published  in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this  chapter), may specify grouping rules (for example, 5-year age groups,  except for extreme ages such as ages above 100 or below 20) and methods  for developing amounts-weighted mortality rates for individual ages from  amounts-weighted mortality rates initially determined for each age  group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Base table construction. The base tables must be constructed  from the amounts-weighted mortality rates determined in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The base tables must be constructed  either directly through graduation of the amounts-weighted mortality  rates or indirectly by applying a level percentage to the applicable  mortality table set forth in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1, provided that the  adjusted table sufficiently reflects the mortality experience of the  plan. The Commissioner also may permit the use of other recognized  mortality tables in the construction of base tables, applying a similar  mortality experience standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Base year requirements. The base year is the calendar year  that contains   the day before the midpoint of the experience study period. If the base  table is constructed by applying a level percentage to a table set forth  in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1, then the percentage must be applied to the table  under Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1 after it has been projected to the base year  using Projection Scale AA, as set forth in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1(d). Thus,  for example, if the base year of the mortality experience study is 2005,  the applicable base (year 2000) mortality rates must be projected 5  years prior to determining the level percentage to be applied to the  applicable projected base (year 2000) mortality rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Change in number of individuals covered by table. Experience  data cannot be used to develop a base table if the number of individuals  in the population covered by the table (for example, the male annuitant  population) as of the last day of the plan year before the year the  request to use substitute mortality tables is made, compared to the  average number of individuals in that population over the years covered  by the experience study on which the substitute mortality tables are  based, reflects a difference of 20 percent or more, unless it is  demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the experience  data is accurately predictive of future mortality of that plan  population (taking into account the effect of the change in individuals)  after appropriate adjustments to the data are made (for example,  excluding data from individuals with respect to a spun-off portion of  the plan). For this purpose, a reasonable estimate of the number of  individuals in the population covered by the table may be used, such as  the estimated number of participants and beneficiaries used for purposes  of the PBGC Form 1-ES.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of substitute mortality tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  plan's substitute mortality tables must be generational mortality  tables. Substitute mortality tables are determined using the base  mortality tables developed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section  and the projection factors provided in Projection Scale AA, as set forth  in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1(d). Under the generational mortality tables, the  probability of an individual's death at a particular age is determined  as the individual's base mortality rate (that is, the applicable  mortality rate from the base mortality table for the age for which the  probability of death is being determined) multiplied by the mortality  improvement factor. The mortality improvement factor is equal to (1 -  projection factor for that age) \n\, where n is equal to the projection  period (the number of years between the base year for the base mortality  table and the calendar year in which the individual attains the age for  which the probability of death is being determined).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example of calculation. As an example of the use of  generational mortality tables under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,  if approved substitute mortality tables are based on data collected  during 2005 and 2006, the base year would be 2005 because 2005 would be  the year that contains the day before the midpoint of the experience  study period. If the tables show a base mortality rate of .006000 for  male annuitants at age 54, the probability of death at age 54 for a male  annuitant born in 1974 would be determined using the base mortality rate  of .006000, the age-54 projection factor of .020 (pursuant to the Scale  AA Projection Factors set forth in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1(d)) and a  projection period of 23 years. The projection period is the number of  years between the base year of 2005 and the calendar year in which the  individual reaches age 54. Accordingly, the mortality improvement factor  would be .628347 and the probability of death at age 54 would be  .003770.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Separate tables for specified populations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(4), separate substitute  mortality tables are permitted to be used for separate populations  within a gender under a plan only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All individuals of that gender in the plan are divided into  separate populations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each separate population has credible mortality experience as  provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The separate substitute mortality table for each separate  population is developed using mortality experience data for that  population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annuitant and nonannuitant separate populations.  Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section, substitute  mortality tables for separate populations of annuitants and  nonannuitants within a gender may be used even if only one of those  separate populations has credible mortality experience. Similarly, if  separate populations that satisfy paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section  are established, then any of those populations may be further subdivided  into separate annuitant and nonannuitant subpopulations, provided that  at least one of the two resulting subpopulations has credible mortality  experience. The standard mortality tables under Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1 are  used for a resulting subpopulation that does not have credible mortality  experience. For example, in the case of a plan that has credible  mortality experience for both its male hourly and salaried individuals,  if the male salaried annuitant population has credible mortality  experience, the plan may use substitute mortality tables with respect to  that population even if the standard mortality tables under Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-1 are used for the male salaried nonannuitant population  (because that nonannuitant population does not have credible mortality  experience).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section  must be satisfied but, in applying that paragraph, the annuitant (or  nonannuitant) population should be substituted for the particular  gender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All plans in controlled group must use  substitute mortality tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (d)(1), substitute mortality tables are  permitted to be used for a plan for a plan year only if, for that plan  year (or any portion of that plan year), substitute mortality tables are  also approved and used for each other pension plan subject to the  requirements of section 430 that is maintained by the sponsor and by  each member of the plan sponsor's controlled group. For purposes of this  section, the term controlled group means any group treated as a single  employer under paragraph (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plans without credible experience--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For the  first year for which a plan uses substitute mortality tables, the use of  substitute mortality tables for the plan is not prohibited merely  because another plan described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section  cannot use substitute mortality tables because neither the males nor the  females under that other plan have credible mortality experience for a  plan year. For each subsequent plan year, the plan sponsor may continue  to use substitute mortality tables for the plan with credible mortality  experience without using substitute mortality tables for the other plan  only if neither the males nor the females under that other plan have  credible mortality experience for that subsequent plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section must be satisfied for that plan year.  Thus, a plan is not prohibited from using substitute mortality tables  for a plan year merely because another plan in the controlled group of  the plan sponsor does not have at least 1,000 male deaths and does not  have at least 1,000 female deaths in a 4-year period (or a period that  is the length of the experience study period if the experience study  period under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is longer than 4  years) that ends less than 3 years before the first day of that plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Newly affiliated plans not using substitute mortality tables-- (A) In general. The use of substitute mortality   tables for a plan is not prohibited merely because a newly affiliated  plan does not use substitute mortality tables, but only through the last  day of the plan year of the plan using substitute mortality tables that  contains the last day of the period described in section  410(b)(6)(C)(ii) for either the newly affiliated plan or the plan using  substitute mortality tables, whichever is later. Thus, for the following  plan year, the mortality tables prescribed under Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1  apply with respect to the plan (and all other plans within the plan  sponsor's controlled group, including the newly affiliated plan)  unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The newly affiliated plan cannot use substitute mortality tables  because neither the males nor the females under the plan have credible  mortality experience as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section (as determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph  (d)(1)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of newly affiliated plan. For purposes of this  section, a plan is treated as a newly affiliated plan if it becomes  maintained by the plan sponsor (or by a member of the plan sponsor's  controlled group) in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar  transaction described in Sec. 1.410(b)-2(f). A plan also is treated as  a newly affiliated plan for purposes of this section if the plan is  established in connection with a transfer of assets and liabilities from  another employer's plan in connection with a merger, acquisition, or  similar transaction described in Sec. 1.410(b)-2(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Demonstration of credible mortality experience for newly  affiliated plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. In general, in the case of a newly  affiliated plan described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the  demonstration of whether credible mortality experience exists for the  plan for a plan year may be made by either including or excluding  mortality experience data for the period prior to the date the plan  becomes maintained by a member of the new plan sponsor's controlled  group. If a plan sponsor excludes mortality experience data for the  period prior to the date the plan becomes maintained within the new plan  sponsor's controlled group, the exclusion must apply for all populations  within the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Demonstration of credible mortality experience. Regardless of  whether mortality experience data for the period prior to the date a  newly affiliated plan becomes maintained within the new plan sponsor's  controlled group is included or excluded for a plan year, the provisions  of this section, including the demonstration of credible mortality  experience in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, must  be satisfied before substitute mortality tables may be used with respect  to the plan. Thus, for example, the plan must meet the rule in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that the base table be based on mortality  experience data for the plan over a 2-year or longer consecutive period  that ends less than 3 years before the first day of the plan year for  which substitute mortality tables will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Demonstration of lack of credible mortality experience. In the  case of a newly affiliated plan described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of  this section, in order to demonstrate a lack of credible mortality  experience with respect to a gender for a plan year, the rules of  paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section generally will apply. However,  a special rule applies if the plan's mortality experience demonstration  for a plan year is made by excluding mortality experience for the period  prior to the date the plan becomes maintained by a member of the new  plan sponsor's controlled group. In such a case, an employer is  permitted to demonstrate a plan's lack of credible mortality experience  using an experience study period of less than four years, provided that  the experience study period begins with the date the plan becomes  maintained within the sponsor's controlled group and ends not more than  one year and one day before the first day of the plan year with respect  to which the lack of credible mortality experience demonstration is  made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (d)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer A is a corporation and maintains Plan M, which  has a calendar year plan year and has obtained approval to use  substitute mortality tables for 10 years beginning with the plan year  that begins on January 1, 2009. Employer B is a corporation and  maintains Plan N, which does not use substitute mortality tables and has  a calendar year plan year. On July 1, 2010, Employer A acquires 100% of  the stock of Employer B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the  maintenance of Plan N within the controlled group that maintains Plan M  does not impair the use of substitute mortality tables by Plan M through  the end of the plan year that ends on December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section, beginning  with the plan year that begins on January 1, 2012, Plan M continues to  use substitute mortality tables only if either Plan N obtains approval  to use substitute mortality tables or Employer A can demonstrate that  Plan N does not have credible mortality experience. Pursuant to  paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, Employer A is permitted to  either exclude mortality experience date for the period of time before  July 1, 2010 (the date Plan N became maintained with Employer A's  controlled group), or include that mortality experience data for  purposes of demonstrating that Plan N does not have credible mortality  experience. Thus, if there is an experience study that shows that the  male and female populations of Plan N each do not have 1,000 deaths  during the period from July 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, then the  maintenance of Plan N within the Employer A's controlled group does not  impair Plan M's use of substitute mortality tables for Plan M's 2012  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(C)</em> of this section, the maintenance of Plan N within Employer  A's controlled group does not impair Plan M's use of substitute  mortality tables if there is an experience study that shows that the  male and female populations of Plan N each do not have 1,000 deaths  during the period from July 1, 2010, through December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Duration of use of tables. Except as provided in paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, substitute mortality tables are used with  respect to a plan for the term of consecutive plan years specified in  the plan sponsor's written request to use such tables under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section and approved by the Commissioner, or such shorter  period prescribed by the Commissioner in the approval to use substitute  mortality tables. Following the end of such term of use, or following  any early termination of use described in paragraph (d)(4) of this  section, the mortality tables specified in Sec. 1.430(h)(3)-1 apply  with respect to the plan unless approval under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section has been received by the plan sponsor to use substitute  mortality tables for a further term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aggregation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permissive aggregation of plans. In order for a  plan sponsor to use a set of substitute mortality tables with respect to  two or more plans, the rules of this section are applied by treating  those plans as a single plan. In such a case, the substitute mortality  tables must be used for the aggregated plans and must be based on data  collected with respect to those aggregated plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Required aggregation of plans. In general, plans are not  required to be aggregated for purposes of applying the rules of this  section. However, for purposes of this section, a plan is required to be  aggregated with any plan that was previously spun off from that plan for  purposes of this section if the Commissioner determines that one purpose  of the spinoff is to avoid the use of substitute mortality tables for  any of the plans that were involved in the spinoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Early termination of use of tables--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.

However, a change in  coverage is not treated as significant if the plan's actuary certifies  in writing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the substitute  mortality tables used by the plan with respect to the covered population  continue to be accurately predictive of future mortality of that  population (taking into account the effect of the change in the plan  population).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/Applicability date. This section applies for plan  years beginning on or after January 1, 2009.  [T.D. 9419, 73 FR 44644, July 31, 2008]    Sec. 1.430(i)-1  Special rules for plans in at-risk status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview. This section provides special rules  related to determining the funding target and making other computations  for certain defined benefit plans that are in at-risk status for the  plan year. Section 430(i) and this section apply to single employer  defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans) but do not  apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). Paragraph  (b) of this section describes rules for determining whether a plan is in  at-risk status for a plan year, including the determination of a plan's  funding target attainment percentage and at-risk funding target  attainment percentage. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the  funding target for a plan in at-risk status. Paragraph (d) of this  section describes the target normal cost for a plan in at-risk status.  Paragraph (e) of this section describes rules regarding how the funding  target and the target normal cost are determined for a plan that has  been in at-risk status for fewer than 5 consecutive plan years.  Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth effective/applicability dates  and transition rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for multiple employer plans. In the case of a  multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules  of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer  under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. For  example, at-risk status is determined separately for each employer under  such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan  to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described  in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section  413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are  applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of at-risk status of a plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a plan is in at-risk  status for a plan year if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The funding target attainment percentage for the preceding plan  year (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is less than 80  percent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The at-risk funding target attainment percentage for the  preceding plan year (determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section)  is less than 70 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em>, then the plan is  not treated as being in at-risk status for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At-risk funding target attainment percentage. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the at-risk  funding target attainment percentage of a plan for a plan year is a  fraction (expressed as a percentage)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the value of plan assets for the plan  year after subtraction of the prefunding balance and the funding  standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(4)(B); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special rule for new plans. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, in the case  of a new plan that was neither the result of a merger nor involved in a  spinoff, the funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(3)  of this section and the at-risk funding target attainment percentage  under paragraph (b)(4) of this section are equal to 100 percent for  years before the plan exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for plans with zero funding target. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, if the  funding target of the plan is equal to zero for a plan year, then the  funding target attainment percentage under paragraph (b)(3) of this  section and the at-risk funding target attainment percentage under  paragraph (b)(4) of this section are equal to 100 percent for that plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception when plan has predecessor plan that was in at-risk  status.

[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for determining at-risk status of plans of  specified automobile manufacturers. See section 430(i)(4)(C) for special  rules for determining the at-risk status of plans of specified  automobile and automobile parts manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Funding target for plans in at-risk status--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If  the plan has been in at-risk status for 5 consecutive years, including  the current plan year, then the funding target for the plan is the at- risk funding target determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  See paragraph (e) of this section for the determination of the funding  target where the plan is in at-risk status for the plan year but was not  in at-risk status for one or more of the 4 preceding plan years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At-risk funding target--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of modified actuarial  assumptions. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), the  at-risk funding target of the plan under this paragraph (c)(2) for the  plan year is equal to the present value of all benefits accrued or  earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, as  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.430(d)-1 but using the additional  actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Funding target includes load. The at-risk funding target is  increased by the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $700 multiplied by the number of participants in the plan  (including active participants, inactive participants, and  beneficiaries); plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Four percent of the funding target (determined under Sec.  1.430(d)-1(b)(2) as if the plan was not in at-risk status) of the plan  for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimum amount. Notwithstanding any otherwise applicable  provisions of this section, the at-risk funding target of a plan for a  plan year is not less than the plan's funding target for the plan year  determined without regard to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional actuarial assumptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The actuarial  assumptions used to determine a plan's at-risk funding target for a plan  year are the actuarial assumptions that are applied under section 430,  with the modifications described in this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> does not affect the application of plan  assumptions regarding an employee's termination of employment prior to  the employee's earliest retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Participants otherwise assumed to retire immediately. The  special retirement age assumption of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this  section does not apply to a participant to the extent the participant is  otherwise assumed to commence benefits during the current plan year  under the actuarial assumptions for the plan. For example, if generally  applicable retirement assumptions would provide for a 25 percent  probability that a participant will commence benefits during the current  plan year, the special retirement age assumption of paragraph  (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section requires the plan's enrolled actuary to  assume a 75 percent probability that the participant will commence  benefits at the end of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Definition of earliest retirement date. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(3)(ii), a plan's earliest retirement date for an employee  is the earliest date on which the employee can commence receiving an  immediate distribution of a fully vested benefit under the plan. See  Sec. 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-17;(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirement to assume most valuable benefit. All participants  and beneficiaries who are assumed to retire on a particular date are  assumed to elect the optional form of benefit available under the plan  that would result in the highest present value of benefits commencing at  that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonable techniques permitted. The plan's actuary is  permitted to use reasonable techniques in determining the actuarial  assumptions that are required to be used pursuant to this paragraph  (c)(3). For example, the plan's actuary is permitted to use reasonable  assumptions in determining the optional form of benefit under the plan  that would result in the highest present value of benefits for this  purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Target normal cost of plans in at-risk status--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.  If the plan has been in at-risk status for 5 consecutive years,  including the current plan year, then the target normal cost for the  plan is the at-risk target normal cost determined under paragraph (d)(2)  of this section. See paragraph (e) of this section for the determination  of the target normal cost where the plan is in at-risk status for the  plan year but was not in at-risk status for one or more of the 4  preceding plan years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At-risk target normal cost--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of modified actuarial  assumptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph (d)(2), the at-risk target normal cost of a plan for the plan  year is equal to the present value (determined as of the valuation date)  of all benefits that accrue during, are earned during, or are otherwise  allocated to service in the plan year, as determined in accordance with  Sec. 1.430(d)-1 but using the additional actuarial assumptions  described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special adjustments. The target normal cost of the plan for the  plan year (determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section) is  adjusted (not below zero) by adding the amount of plan-related expenses  expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year and  subtracting the amount of any mandatory employee contributions expected  to be made during the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Plan-related expenses. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2),  plan-related expenses are determined using the rules of Sec. 1.430(d)- 1(b)(1)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, (C), or (D),  determined as if the plan were not in at-risk status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimum amount. The at-risk target normal cost of a plan for a  plan year is not less than the plan's target normal cost determined  without regard to section 430(i) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transition between applicable funding targets and applicable  target normal costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Funding target. If a plan that is in at-risk  status for the plan year has not been in at-risk status for one or more  of the preceding 4 plan years, the plan's funding target for the plan  year is determined as the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  and this section; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The phase-in percentage for the plan year multiplied by the  excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The at-risk funding target determined under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section (determined taking into account paragraph (e)(4) of this  section); over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The funding target determined without regard to section 430(i)  and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Target normal cost. If a plan that is in at-risk status for the  plan year has not been in at-risk status for one or more of the  preceding 4 plan years, the plan's target normal cost for the plan year  is determined as the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and this section; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The phase-in percentage for the plan year multiplied by the  excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The at-risk target normal cost determined under paragraph (d)(2)  of this section (determined taking into account paragraph (e)(4) of this  section); over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The target normal cost determined without regard to section  430(i) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Phase-in percentage. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the  phase-in percentage is 20 percent multiplied by the number of  consecutive plan years that the plan has been in at-risk status  (including the current plan year) and not taking into account years  before the first effective plan year for a plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transition funding target and target normal cost determined  without load. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if a  plan has not been in at-risk status for 2 or more of the preceding 4  plan years (not taking into account years before the first effective  plan year for a plan), then the plan's at-risk funding target that is  used for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (to  calculate the plan's funding target where the plan has been in at-risk  status for fewer than 5 plan years) is determined without regard to the  loading factor set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  Similarly, if a plan has not been in at-risk status for 2 or more of the  preceding 4 plan years (not taking into account years before the first  effective plan year for a plan), then the plan's at-risk target normal  cost that is used for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this  section (to calculate the plan's target normal cost where the plan has  been in at-risk status for fewer than 5 plan years) is determined  without regard to the loading factor set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability dates and transition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Statutory effective date/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Section  430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1,  2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the  minimum required contribution is delayed for   certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of the Pension  Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicability of special adjustments to target normal cost. The  special adjustments of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section (relating  to adjustments to the target normal cost for plan-related expenses and  mandatory employee contributions) apply to plan years beginning after  December 31, 2008. In addition, a plan sponsor may elect to make the  special adjustments of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section for plan  years beginning in 2008. This election is made in the same manner and is  subject to the same rules as an election to add an amount to the plan's  prefunding balance pursuant to Sec. 1.430(f)-1(f). Thus, the election  can be made no later than the last day for making the minimum required  contribution for the plan year to which the election relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date/applicability date of regulations. This section  applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. For plan  years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on  the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the  requirements of section 430.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First effective plan year. For purposes of this section, the  first effective plan year for a plan is the first plan year to which  section 430 applies to the plan for purposes of determining the minimum  required contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transition rule for determining at-risk status. In the case of  plan years beginning in 2008, 2009, and 2010, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of  this section is applied by substituting the following percentages for  ``80 percent''--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 65 percent in the case of 2008;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 70 percent in the case of 2009; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 75 percent in the case of 2010.
