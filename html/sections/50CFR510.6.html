Such statements should be received at least one week in advance  of the scheduled meeting at which they are expected to be considered by  the committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Opportunities will ordinarily be afforded to interested persons  to speak to agenda items during that portion of the open meeting during  which that item is to be considered by the committee, subject to such  reasonable time limits as the committee may establish, and consideration  of the extent to which the committee has received the benefit of  comments by interested persons, the complexity and the importance of the  subject, the time constraints under which the meeting is to be  conducted, the number of persons who wish to speak during the meeting,  and the extent to which the statement provides the committee with  information which has not previously been available and is relevant to  its decision or other action on that subject. Interested persons may be  required to serve reasonable notice of their intentions to speak so that  the committee may assess whether procedures and scheduling for the  meeting can be adjusted to accommodate large numbers of participants.</p>
