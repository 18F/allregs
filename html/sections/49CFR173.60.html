                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>,  packaging used for Class 1 (explosives) materials must meet Packing  Group II requirements. Each packaging used for an explosive must be  capable of meeting the test requirements of subpart M of part 178 of  this subchapter, at the specified level of performance, and the  applicable general packaging requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The general requirements for packaging of explosives are as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nails, staples, and other closure devices, made of metal, having  no protective covering may not penetrate to the inside of the outer  packaging unless the inner packaging adequately protects the explosive  against contact with the metal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The closure device of containers for liquid explosives must  provide double protection against leakage, such as a screw cap secured  in place with tape.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inner packagings, fittings, and cushioning materials, and the  placing of explosive substances or articles in packages, must be such  that the explosive substance is prevented from becoming loose in the  outer packaging during transportation. Metallic components of articles  must be prevented from making contact with metal packagings. Articles  containing explosive substances not enclosed in an outer casing must be  separated from each other in order to prevent friction and impact.  Padding, trays, partitioning in the inner or outer packaging, molded  plastics or receptacles may be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the packaging includes water that could freeze during  transportation, a sufficient amount of anti-freeze, such as denatured  ethyl alcohol, must be added to the water to prevent freezing. If the  anti-freeze creates a fire hazard, it may not be used. When a percentage  of water in the substance is specified, the combined weight of water and  anti-freeze may be substituted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an article is fitted with its own means of ignition or  initiation, it must be effectively protected from accidental actuation  during normal conditions of transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The entry of explosive substances into the recesses of double- seamed metal packagings must be prevented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The closure device of a metal drum must include a suitable  gasket; if the closure device includes metal-to-metal screw-threads, the  ingress of explosive substances into the threading must be prevented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Whenever loose explosive substances or the explosive substance  of an uncased or partly cased article may come into contact with the  inner surface of metal packagings (1A2, 1B2, 4A, 4B and metal  receptacles), the metal packaging should be provided with an inner liner  or coating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Packagings must be made of materials compatible with, and  impermeable to, the explosives contained in the package, so that neither  interaction between the explosives and the packaging materials, nor  leakage, causes the explosive to become unsafe in transportation, or the  hazard division or compatibility group to change (see  Sec. 173.24(e)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> An explosive article containing an electrical means of  initiation that is sensitive to external electromagnetic radiation, must  have its means of initiation effectively protected from electromagnetic  radiation sources (for example, radar or radio transmitters) through  either design of the packaging or of the article, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Plastic packagings may not be able to generate or accumulate  sufficient static electricity to cause the packaged explosive substances  or articles to initiate, ignite or inadvertently function. Metal  packagings must be compatible with the explosive substance they contain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Explosive substances may not be packed in inner or outer  packagings where the differences in internal and external pressures, due  to thermal or other effects, could cause an explosion or rupture of the  package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Packagings for water soluble substances must be water  resistant. Packagings for desensitized or phlegmatized substances must  be closed to prevent changes in concentration during transport. When  containing less alcohol, water, or phlegmatizer than specified   in its proper shipping description, the substance is a ``forbidden''  material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em>  above subject to approval by the Associate Administrator.  [Amdt. 173-260, 62 FR 24719, May 6, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 50461,  Aug. 18, 2000; 76 FR 43529, July 20, 2011]</p>
