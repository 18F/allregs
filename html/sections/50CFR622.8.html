                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Quotas apply for the fishing year for each species, species  group, sector or component, unless accountability measures are  implemented during the fishing year pursuant to the applicable annual  catch limits and accountability measures sections of subparts B through  V of this part due to a quota overage occurring the previous year, in  which case a reduced quota will be specified through notification in the  Federal Register. Annual quota increases are contingent on the total  allowable catch for the applicable species not being exceeded in the  previous fishing year. If the total allowable catch is exceeded in the  previous fishing year, the RA will file a notification with the Office  of the Federal Register to maintain the quota for the applicable  species, sector or component from the previous fishing year for  following fishing years, unless NMFS determines based upon the best  scientific information available that maintaining the quota from the  previous year is unnecessary. Except for the quotas for Gulf and South  Atlantic coral, the quotas include species harvested from state waters  adjoining the EEZ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quota closures. When a quota specified in this part is reached,  or is projected to be reached, the Assistant Administrator will file a  notification to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register. On  and after the effective date of such notification, for the remainder of  the fishing year, the applicable closure restrictions for such a quota,  as specified in this part apply. (See the applicable annual catch limits  (ACLs), annual catch targets (ACTs), and accountability measures (AMs)  sections of subparts B through V of this part for closure provisions  when an applicable ACL or ACT is reached or projected to be reached).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reopening. When a species, sector or component has been closed  based on   a projection of the quota specified in this part, or the ACL specified  in the applicable annual catch limits and accountability measures  sections of subparts B through V of this part being reached and  subsequent data indicate that the quota or ACL was not reached, the  Assistant Administrator may file a notification to that effect with the  Office of the Federal Register. Such notification may reopen the  species, sector or component to provide an opportunity for the quota or  ACL to be harvested.
