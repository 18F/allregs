attainment demonstration a SIP revision demonstrating that it has adopted all reasonably available control measures (including RACT for stationary sources) necessary to demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable and to meet any RFP requirements. The SIP revision shall contain the list of the potential measures considered by the State, and information and analysis sufficient to support the State's judgment that it has adopted all RACM, including RACT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining whether a particular emission reduction measure or set of measures must be adopted as RACM under section 172(c)(1) of the Act, the State must consider the cumulative impact of implementing the available measures. Potential measures that are reasonably available considering technical and economic feasibility must be adopted as RACM if, considered collectively, they would advance the attainment date by one year or more.</p>
