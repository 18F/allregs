than the stated interest rate of the early-redeemed SLGS security. The total redemption value for bonds and notes can be determined by the following two steps. First, calculate accrued interest payable in accordance with Sec. 344.6(d)(1) using the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE00.007
