In  the event this information is not furnished to the Assistant Secretary  within sixty (60) days of the date of the request, the complaint may be  closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of complaint--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written complaints.

Complaints may be reasonably and fairly  amended at any time. Such amendments may include, but are not limited  to, amendments to cure, technical defects or omissions, including  failure to sign or affirm a complaint, to clarify or amplify the  allegations in a complaint, or to join additional or substitute  respondents. Except for the purposes of notifying respondents, amended  complaints will be considered as having been made as of the original  filing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Resolution of complaint by recipient. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within ten (10) days  of timely filing of a complaint that contains complete information (in  accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), the Assistant  Secretary shall determine whether the complainant alleges an action or  omission by a recipient or the recipient's contractor that if proven  qualifies as noncompliance with section 3. If a determination is made  that there is an allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the  complaint shall be sent to the recipient for resolution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the recipient believes that the complaint lacks merit, the  recipient must notify the Assistant Secretary in writing of this  recommendation with supporting reasons, within 30 days of the date of  receipt of the complaint. The determination that a complaint lacks merit  is reserved to the Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the recipient determines that there is merit to the  complaint, the recipient will have sixty (60) days from the date of  receipt of the complaint to resolve the matter with the complainant.

Upon receipt of the recipient's written  recommendation that there is no merit to the complaint, or upon failure  of the recipient and complainant to reach resolution, the Assistant  Secretary shall review the complaint to determine whether it presents a  valid   allegation of noncompliance with section 3. The Assistant Secretary may  conduct further investigation if deemed necessary. Where the complaint  fails to present a valid allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the  Assistant Secretary will dismiss the complaint without further action.  The Assistant Secretary shall notify the complainant of the dismissal of  the complaint and the reasons for the dismissal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Informal resolution. Where the allegations in a complaint on  their face, or as amplified by the statements of the complainant,  present a valid allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the  Assistant Secretary will attempt, through informal methods, to obtain a  voluntary and just resolution of the complaint. Where attempts to  resolve the complaint informally fail, the Assistant Secretary will  impose a resolution on the recipient and complainant. Any resolution  imposed by the Assistant Secretary will be in accordance with  requirements and procedures concerning the imposition of sanctions or  resolutions as set forth in the regulations governing the HUD program  under which the section 3 covered assistance was provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date of informal resolution. The imposed resolution  will become effective and binding at the expiration of 15 days following  notification to recipient and complainant by certified mail of the  imposed resolution, unless either party appeals the resolution before  the expiration of the 15 days.
