                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of this section. Emissions that do not exceed the  standards comply with the standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gaseous and particulate standards. Gaseous and particulate  emission standards are expressed as gram per brake horsepower hour (g/ bhp-hr). Non-methane hydrocarbon standards apply to locomotives and  locomotive engines fueled with natural gas, and any combination of  natural gas and other fuels where natural gas is the primary fuel; total  hydrocarbon equivalent standards apply to locomotives and locomotive  engines fueled with an alcohol, and any combination of alcohol and other  fuels where alcohol is the primary fuel. Total hydrocarbon standards  apply to all other locomotives and locomotive engines; that is, those  not fueled by natural gas or alcohol. The line-haul duty-cycle standards  and switch duty-cycle standards apply to the respective cycle-weighted  emission rates as calculated in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tier 0. The following locomotives (and the engines used in the  following locomotives) are subject to the Tier 0 emission standards  listed in table A8-1 of this section: Locomotives manufactured on, or  after, January 1, 1973, and   before January 1, 2002; and upgraded locomotives manufactured prior to  January 1, 1973. The standards apply when such a locomotive or  locomotive engine is manufactured, remanufactured, or imported on or  after January 1, 2002; except where the locomotive was previously  certified to one or more FELs under subpart D of this part instead of  the applicable standards, in which case, the applicable standards are  replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the FELs specified by the  previous certificate. Example: a locomotive that is certified to a  NOX FEL of 8.0 g/bhp-hr must be recertified to a  NOX FEL of 8.0 g/bhp-hr at each subsequent remanufacture,  except as allowed by paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tier 1. Locomotives and engines used in locomotives  manufactured on, or after, January 1, 2002, and before January 1, 2005  are subject to the Tier 1 standards listed in table A8-2 of this  section. The standards apply when such a locomotive or locomotive engine  is manufactured or imported, and each time it is remanufactured; except  where the locomotive was previously certified to one or more FELs under  subpart D of this part instead of the applicable standard, in which  case, the standards are replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the  FELs specified by the previous certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Tier 2. Locomotives and engines used in locomotives  manufactured on, or after, January 1, 2005 are subject to the Tier 2  standards listed in table A8-3 of this section. The standards apply when  such a locomotive or locomotive engine is manufactured or imported, and  each time it is remanufactured except where the locomotive was  previously certified to one or more FELs under subpart D of this part  instead of the applicable standard, in which case, the standards are  replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the FELs specified by the  previous certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Smoke standards. The smoke opacity standards listed in table A8- 4 of this section apply, as specified in the table, to locomotives and  locomotive engines subject to the Tier 0, Tier 1, or Tier 2 standards.  Smoke emissions, when measured in accordance with the provisions of  subpart B of this part, shall not exceed the standards of table A8-4 of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternate standards. In lieu of the CO and PM standards  specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, manufacturers and  remanufacturers may elect to comply with the alternate CO and PM  standards listed in table A8-5 of this section. Manufacturers and  remanufacturers electing to comply with these alternate standards must  comply with both the CO and PM standards listed in table A8-5 of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Averaging, banking and trading. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In lieu of the  NOX and/or PM standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, manufacturers and remanufacturers may elect to include engine  families in the averaging, banking, and trading program, the provisions  of which are specified in subpart D of this part. The manufacturer or  remanufacturer must set family emission limits (FEL) for the applicable  duty-cycle. This FEL serves as the standard for that family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When a locomotive is certified to an FEL other than the  applicable standard, it must be recertified to that same FEL at all  subsequent remanufactures, except as specified otherwise in paragraph  (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After a locomotive has been certified to any given FEL other  than the applicable standard, it may be recertified to a different FEL  at a subsequent remanufacture, as allowed by subpart D of this part. For  subsequent remanufactures (i.e. those remanufactures that occur after  the recertification to a different FEL), the locomotive must be  recertified to the FEL(s) and standards that were applicable to the  locomotive during its previous useful life, except where specified  otherwise by subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Tables.
