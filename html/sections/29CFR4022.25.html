                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to the guarantee of benefit  increases which have been in effect for less than five years with  respect to participants other than substantial owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phase-in formula. The amount of a benefit increase computed  pursuant to Sec. 4022.24 shall be guaranteed to the extent provided in  the following formula: the number of years the benefit increase has been  in effect, not to exceed five, multiplied by the greater of (1) 20  percent of the amount computed pursuant to Sec. 4022.24; or (2) $20 per  month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of years. In computing the number of years a benefit  increase has been in effect, each complete 12-month period ending on or  before the termination date during which such benefit increase was in  effect constitutes one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiple benefit increases. In applying the formula contained in  paragraph (b) of this section, multiple benefit increases within any 12- month period ending on or before the termination date and calculated  from that date are aggregated and treated as one benefit increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section,  a benefit increase described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  guaranteed only if PBGC determines that the plan was terminated for a  reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the  payment of benefits by PBGC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy  termination, ``bankruptcy filing date'' is substituted for ``termination  date'' each place that ``termination date'' appears in paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section. Example: A plan amendment that was adopted and  effective in February 2007 increased a participant's benefit by $300 per  month (as computed under Sec. 4022.24). The contributing sponsor of the  plan filed a bankruptcy petition in March 2009 and the plan has a  termination date in April 2010. PBGC's guarantee of the participant's  benefit increase is limited to $120 ($300 x 40%), because the increase  was made more than 2 years but less than 3 years before the bankruptcy  filing date.
