                            <p class="depth0">Critical habitat is designated for the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Distinct

Population Segment of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as described in this section. The textual descriptions of critical habitat in this section are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. For nearshore reproductive areas, the areas extend directly from the mean high water (MHW) line datum at each end of the area seaward 1.6 km. Where beaches are within 1.6 km of each other, nearshore areas are connected, either along the shoreline (MHW line) or by delineating on GIS a straight line from the end of one beach to the beginning of another (either from island to island, or across an inlet or the mouth of an estuary). Although generally following these rules, the exact delineation of each area was determined individually because each was unique. The overview maps are provided for general guidance only and not as a definitive source for determining critical habitat boundaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Critical habitat boundaries.

The physical or biological features (PBFs) and primary constituent elements (PCEs) essential for conservation of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS of the loggerhead sea turtle are identified by habitat type below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nearshore reproductive habitat. The PBF of nearshore reproductive habitat as a portion of the nearshore waters adjacent to nesting beaches that are used by hatchlings to egress to the open-water environment as well as by nesting females to transit between beach and open water during the nesting season. The following PCEs support this habitat:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nearshore waters directly off the highest density nesting beaches and their adjacent beaches, as identified in 50 CFR 17.95(c), to 1.6 km offshore;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Waters sufficiently free of obstructions or artificial lighting to allow transit through the surf zone and outward toward open water; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Waters with minimal manmade structures that could promote predators (i.e., nearshore predator concentration caused by submerged and emergent offshore structures), disrupt wave patterns necessary for orientation, and/or create excessive longshore currents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Winter habitat. We describe the PBF of the winter habitat as warm water habitat south of Cape Hatteras near the western edge of the Gulf Stream used by a high concentration of juveniles and adults during the winter months. PCEs that support this habitat are the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Water temperatures above 10 [deg]C from November through April;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Continental shelf waters in proximity to the western boundary of the Gulf Stream; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Water depths between 20 and 100 m.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Breeding habitat. We describe the PBF of concentrated breeding habitat as those sites with high densities of both male and female adult individuals during the breeding season. PCEs that support this habitat are the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> High densities of reproductive male and female loggerheads;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proximity to primary Florida migratory corridor; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Proximity to Florida nesting grounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Constricted migratory habitat. We describe the PBF of constricted migratory habitat as high use migratory corridors that are constricted (limited in width) by land on one side and the edge of the continental shelf and Gulf Stream on the other side. PCEs that support this habitat are the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constricted continental shelf area relative to nearby continental shelf waters that concentrate migratory pathways; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Passage conditions to allow for migration to and from nesting, breeding, and/or foraging areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sargassum habitat. We describe the PBF of loggerhead Sargassum habitat as developmental and foraging habitat for young loggerheads where surface waters form accumulations of floating material, especially Sargassum. PCEs that support this habitat are the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Convergence zones, surface-water downwelling areas, the margins of major boundary currents (Gulf Stream), and other locations where there are concentrated components of the Sargassum community in water temperatures suitable for the optimal growth of Sargassum and inhabitance of loggerheads;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sargassum in concentrations that support adequate prey abundance and cover;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Available prey and other material associated with Sargassum habitat including, but not limited to, plants and cyanobacteria and animals native to the Sargassum community such as hydroids and copepods; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sufficient water depth and proximity to available currents to ensure offshore transport (out of the surf zone), and foraging and cover requirements by Sargassum for post-hatchling loggerheads, i.e., 10 m depth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Areas not included in critical habitat. Critical habitat does not include the following particular areas where they overlap with the areas described in paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to ESA section 4(a)(3)(B), all areas subject to the Naval Air Station Key West Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to ESA section 3(5)(A)(i), all federally authorized or permitted manmade structures such as aids-to-navigation, boat ramps, platforms, docks, and pilings existing within the legal boundaries on August 11, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maps of loggerhead critical habitat follow:
