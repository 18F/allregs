Through the application review process, the CDFI Fund will evaluate Qualified Issuer applicants on a merit basis and in a fair and consistent manner. Each Qualified Issuer applicant will be reviewed on its ability to successfully implement the activities proposed in its Qualified Issuer Application and carry out the responsibilities of a Qualified Issuer over the life of the Bond. The CDFI Fund will periodically reevaluate the Qualified Issuer over the life of the Bond to ensure it meets the performance standards over the life of the facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility and completeness.

The CDFI Fund reserves the right to request additional information
