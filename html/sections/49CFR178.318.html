                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This specification pertains to a container to be used for the transportation of detonators and percussion caps in connection with the transportation of liquid nitroglycerin, desensitized liquid nitroglycerin or diethylene glycol dinitrate, where any or all of such types of caps may be used for the detonation of liquid nitroglycerin, desentitized liquid nitroglycerin or diethylene glycol dinitrate in blasting operations. This specification is not intended to take the place of any shipping or packing requirements of this Department where the caps in question are themselves articles of commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
[29 FR 18975, Dec. 29, 1964. Redesignated at 32 FR 5606, Apr. 5, 1967, and amended by Amdt. 178-60, 44 FR 70733, Dec. 10, 1979]


Sec. 178.318-2  Container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Every container for detonators and percussion caps coming within the scope of this specification shall be constructed entirely of hard rubber, phenolresinous or other resinous material, or other nonmetallic, nonsparking material, except that metal parts may be used in such locations as not in any event to come in contact with any of the caps. Space shall be provided so that each detonator of whatever nature may be inserted in an individual cell in the body of the container, into which each such cap shall snugly fit. There shall be provided no more than twenty (20) such cellular spaces. Space may be provided into which a plurality of percussion caps may be carried, provided that such space may be closed with a screw cap, and further provided that each or any such space is entirely separate from any space provided for any detonator. Each cellular space into which a detonator is to be inserted and carried shall be capable of being covered by a rotary cover so arranged as to expose not more than one cell at any time, and capable of rotation to such a place that all cells will be covered at the same time, at which place means shall be provided to lock the cover in place. Means shall be provided to lock in place the cover for the cells provided for the carrying of detonators. The requirement that not more than one cell be exposed at one time need not apply in the case of detonators, although spaces for such caps and detonators shall be separate. Sufficient annular space shall be provided inside the cover for such detonators that, when the cover is closed, there will be sufficient space to accommodate the wires customarily attached to such caps. If the material is of such a nature as to require treatment to prevent the absorption of moisture, such treatment shall be applied as shall be necessary in order to provide against the penetration of water by permeation. A suitable carrying handle shall be provided, except for which handle no part of the container may project beyond the exterior of the body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exhibited in plates I and II are line drawings of a container for detonators and percussion caps, illustrative of the requirements set forth in Sec. 178.318-2(a). These plates shall not be construed as a part of this specification.
