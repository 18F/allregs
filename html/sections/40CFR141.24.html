(i.e., when water representative of all sources is being used).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each community and non-transient non-community water system shall take four consecutive quarterly samples for each contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (2) through (21) during each compliance period, beginning in the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the initial monitoring for contaminants listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (1) through (8) and the monitoring for the contaminants listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (9) through (21) as allowed in paragraph (f)(18) has been completed by December 31, 1992, and the system did not detect any contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (1) through (21), then each ground and surface water system shall take one sample annually beginning with the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> After a minimum of three years of annual sampling, the State may allow groundwater systems with no previous detection of any contaiminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) to take one sample during each compliance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each community and non-transient non-community ground water system which does not detect a contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (1) through (21) may apply to the State for a waiver from the requirements of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(6) of this section after completing the initial monitoring. (For purposes of this section, detection is defined as =0.0005 mg/l.) A waiver shall be effective for no more than six years (two compliance periods). States may also issue waivers to small systems for the initial round of monitoring for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A State may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factor(s):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Knowledge of previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence of the system. If a determination by the State reveals no previous use of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If previous use of the contaminant is unknown or it has been used previously, then the following factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Previous analytical results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The proximity of the system to a potential point or non-point source of contamination. Point sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a water treatment facility or at manufacturing, distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling or treatment facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The environmental persistence and transport of the contaminants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The number of persons served by the public water system and the proximity of a smaller system to a larger system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> How well the water source is protected against contamination, such as whether it is a surface or groundwater system. Groundwater systems must consider factors such as depth of the well, the type of soil, and wellhead protection. Surface water systems must consider watershed protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> As a condition of the waiver a groundwater system must take one sample at each sampling point during the time the waiver is effective (i.e., one sample during two compliance periods or six years) and update its vulnerability assessment considering the factors listed in paragraph (f)(8) of this section. Based on this vulnerability assessment the State must reconfirm that the system is non-vulnerable. If the State does not make this reconfirmation within three years of the initial determination, then the waiver is invalidated and the system is required to sample annually as specified in paragraph (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Each community and non-transient non-community surface water system which does not detect a contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (1) through (21) may apply to the State for a waiver from the requirements of (f)(5) of this section after completing the initial monitoring. Composite samples from a maximum of five sampling points are allowed, provided that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is less than one-fifth of the MCL. Systems meeting this criterion must be determined by the State to be non-vulnerable based on a vulnerability assessment during each compliance period. Each system receiving a waiver shall sample at the frequency specified by the State (if any).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> If a contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a) (2) through (21) is detected at a level exceeding 0.0005 mg/l in any sample, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The system must monitor quarterly at each sampling point which resulted in a detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement speci fied in paragraph (f)(11)(i) of this section provided it has determined that the system is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level.

Systems which monitor annually must monitor during the quarter(s) which previously yielded the highest analytical result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Systems which have three consecutive annual samples with no detection of a contaminant may apply to the State for a waiver as specified in paragraph (f)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Groundwater systems which have detected one or more of the following two-carbon organic compounds: trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, or 1,1-dichloroethylene shall monitor quarterly for vinyl chloride. A vinyl chloride sample shall be taken at each sampling point at which one or more of the two-carbon organic compounds was detected. If the results of the first analysis do not detect vinyl chloride, the State may reduce the quarterly monitoring frequency of vinyl chloride monitoring to one sample during each compliance period. Surface water systems are required to monitor for vinyl chloride as specified by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Systems which violate the requirements of Sec.  141.61(a) (1) through (21), as determined by paragraph (f)(15) of this section, must monitor quarterly. After a minimum of four consecutive quarterly samples which show the system is in compliance as specified in paragraph (f)(15) of this section the system and the State determines that the system is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level, the system may monitor at the frequency and times specified in paragraph (f)(11)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The State may require a confirmation sample for positive or negative results. If a confirmation sample is required by the State, the result must be averaged with the first sampling result and the average is used for the compliance determination as specified by paragraph (f)(15). States have discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors from this calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> The State may reduce the total number of samples a system must analyze by allowing the use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five sampling points are allowed, provided that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is less than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of samples must be done in the laboratory and analyzed within 14 days of sample collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the concentration in the composite sample is greater than or equal to 0.0005 mg/l for any contaminant listed in Sec.  141.61(a), then a follow-up sample must be taken within 14 days at each sampling point included in the composite, and be analyzed for that contaminant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling point used in the composite sample are available, the system may use these instead of resampling. The duplicates must be analyzed and the results reported to the State within 14 days after completing analysis of the composite sample, provided the holding time of the sample is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the population served by the system is 3,300 persons, then compositing may only be permitted by the State at sampling points within a single system. In systems serving <=3,300 persons, the State may permit compositing among different systems provided the 5-sample limit is maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Compositing samples prior to GC analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Add 5 ml or equal larger amounts of each sample (up to 5 samples are allowed) to a 25 ml glass syringe.
