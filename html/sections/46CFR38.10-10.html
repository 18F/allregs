                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The piping shall be designed for a working pressure of not less  than the maximum pressure to which it may be subjected but in no case  less than the design pressure of the cargo tanks. In the case of piping  on the discharge side of the liquid pumps or vapor compressors, the  design pressure shall not be less than the pump or compressor discharge  relief valve setting; or, provided the piping is not protected by relief  valves, the design pressure shall not be less than the total discharge  head of the pump or compressor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Piping subject to tank pressure shall be seamless drawn steel or  electric resistance welded steel. Pipe used in refrigerated tank systems  shall be of a material which is suitable for the minimum service  temperature to which it may be subjected, according to the requirements  of part 56 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Piping shall be provided with adequate support to take the  weight of the piping off valves and fittings and to prevent excessive  vibration and stresses on tank connections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For nonpressure vessel type tanks, the cargo handling  arrangements and piping shall provide for emptying of a damaged tank,  including cargo contained by a secondary barrier.
