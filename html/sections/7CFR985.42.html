At the end of a marketing year, funds in excess of  the year's expenses may be placed in an operating reserve not to exceed  approximately one marketing year's operational expenses or such lower  limits as the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may  establish. Funds in such reserve shall be available for use by the  Committee for expenses authorized pursuant to Sec. 985.40. Funds in  excess of those placed in the operating reserve shall be refunded to  handlers: Provided, That any sum paid by a first handler in excess of  that handler's pro rata share of the expenses during any marketing year  may be applied by the Committee at the end of such marketing year to any  outstanding obligations due the Committee from such person. Each  handler's share of such excess funds shall be the amount of assessments  paid in excess of that handler's pro rata share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of funds upon termination of order. Upon termination  of   this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of  liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may  determine to be appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practicable,  such funds will be returned pro rata to the first handler from whom such  funds were collected.</p><p class="depth2">Volume Limitations</p>
