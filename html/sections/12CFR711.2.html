For purposes of that section 202, shares held by an individual include shares held by members of his or her immediate family. ``Immediate family'' means spouse, mother, father, child, grandchild, sister, brother, or any of their spouses, whether or not any of their shares are held in trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term affiliate has the meaning given in section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201). For purposes of that section 202, shares held by an individual include shares held by members of his or her immediate family. ``Immediate family'' means spouse, mother, father, child, grandchild, sister, brother, or any of their spouses, whether or not any of their shares are held in trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of section 202(3)(B) of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201(3)(B)), an affiliate relationship involving a depository institution based on common ownership does not exist if the appropriate federal supervisory agency determines, after giving the affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the asserted affiliation was established in order to avoid the prohibitions of the Interlocks Act and does not represent a true commonality of interest between the depository organizations. In making this determination, the appropriate Federal supervisory agency considers, among other things, whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family, whose shares are necessary to constitute the group owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Area median income means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The median family income for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA), if a depository organization is located in an MSA; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The statewide nonmetropolitan median family income, if a depository organization is located outside an MSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Community means a city, town, or village, and contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages means cities, towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points.
