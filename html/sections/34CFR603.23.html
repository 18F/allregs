                            <p class="depth0">For initial recognition and for renewal of recognition, the State agency will furnish information establishing its compliance with the criteria set forth in Sec.  603.24. This information may

be supplemented by personal interviews or by review of the agency's facilities, records, personnel qualifications, and administrative management. Each agency listed will be reevaluated by the Secretary at his discretion, but at least once every four years. No adverse decision will become final without affording an opportunity for a hearing.
