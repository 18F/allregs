The tank opening in way of pipe  connections shall be properly reinforced where necessary. Where liquid  level indicating devices are attached to the tank, they shall be of heat  resistant materials adequately protected from mechanical damage and  provided at the tank connections with devices which will automatically  close in the event of rupture of the gage or gage lines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All tanks exceeding 30 inches in any horizontal dimension shall  be fitted with vertical baffle plates where necessary for strength or  for control of excessive surge. In general, baffle plates installed at  intervals not exceeding 30 inches will be considered as meeting this  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Baffle plates, where required, shall be of the same material and  not less than the minimum thickness required in the tank walls and shall  be connected to the tank walls by welding or brazing.

No tank shall be located in a compartment where the  temperature may exceed 150 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When cylindrical tanks are installed, longitudinal seams shall  be located as near the top of the tank as possible. Fuel tanks shall be  located in, or as close as practicable, to the machinery space which is  served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel tanks shall be so installed as to permit examination,  testing, or removal for cleaning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fuel tanks shall be adequately supported and braced to prevent  movement.

A standpipe of 11\1/2\ feet in height  attached to the tank may be filled with water to accomplish the 5 pounds  per square inch test. Permanent deformation of the tank will not be  cause for rejection unless accompanied by leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After installation of the fuel tank on a vessel the complete  installation shall be tested in the presence of a marine inspector to a  head not less than   that to which the tank may be subjected in service. Fuel may be used as  a testing medium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All tanks not vented to atmosphere shall be constructed and  tested in accordance with part 54 of this subchapter.
