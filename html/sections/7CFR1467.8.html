The State Conservationist shall submit geographic area rate caps and supporting documentation to the Chief for approval. Each State Conservationist will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include: Soil types, type(s) of crops capable of being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance of offered easement compensation. (1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim to additional compensation based on fair market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS.

NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the option agreement to purchase, warranty easement deed, or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses. For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse participants for their fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as
