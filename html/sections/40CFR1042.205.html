                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies the information that must be in your application,

unless we ask you to include less information under Sec.  1042.201(c). We may require you to provide additional information to evaluate your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Describe the engine family's specifications and other basic parameters of the engine's design and emission controls. List the fuel type on which your engines are designed to operate (for example, ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel). List each distinguishable engine configuration in the engine family. For each engine configuration, list the maximum engine power and the range of values for maximum engine power resulting from production tolerances, as described in Sec.  1042.140.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explain how the emission control system operates. Describe in detail all system components for controlling exhaust emissions, including all auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) and all fuel-system components you will install on any production or test engine. Identify the part number of each component you describe. For this paragraph (b), treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate differently from each other. Include all the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give a general overview of the engine, the emission control strategies, and all AECDs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe each AECD's general purpose and function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the parameters that each AECD senses (including measuring, estimating, calculating, or empirically deriving the values). Include vessel-based parameters and state whether you simulate them during testing with the applicable procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe the purpose for sensing each parameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify the location of each sensor the AECD uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identify the threshold values for the sensed parameters that activate the AECD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Describe the parameters that the AECD modulates (controls) in response to any sensed parameters, including the range of modulation for each parameter, the relationship between the sensed parameters and the controlled parameters and how the modulation achieves the AECD's stated purpose. Use graphs and tables, as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Describe each AECD's specific calibration details. This may be in the form of data tables, graphical representations, or some other description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Describe the hierarchy among the AECDs when multiple AECDs sense or modulate the same parameter. Describe whether the strategies interact in a comparative or additive manner and identify which AECD takes precedence in responding, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Explain the extent to which the AECD is included in the applicable test procedures specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Do the following additional things for AECDs designed to protect engines or vessels:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the engine and/or vessel design limits that make protection necessary and describe any damage that would occur without the AECD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe how each sensed parameter relates to the protected components' design limits or those operating conditions that cause the need for protection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the relationship between the design limits/parameters being protected and the parameters sensed or calculated as surrogates for those design limits/parameters, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describe how the modulation by the AECD prevents engines and/or vessels from exceeding design limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Explain why it is necessary to estimate any parameters instead of measuring them directly and describe how the AECD calculates the estimated value, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Describe how you calibrate the AECD modulation to activate only during conditions related to the stated need to protect components and only as needed to sufficiently protect those components in a way that minimizes the emission impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Include any other information required by this part with respect to AECDs. For example, see Sec.  1042.115 for requirements related to on-off technologies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your engines are equipped with an engine diagnostic system, explain how it works, describing especially the engine conditions (with the corresponding diagnostic trouble codes)

that cause the malfunction-indicator light to go on.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Describe the engines you selected for testing and the reasons for selecting them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used, including the duty cycle(s) and the corresponding engine applications. Also describe any special or alternate test procedures you used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Describe how you operated the emission-data engine before testing, including the duty cycle and the number of engine operating hours used to stabilize emission levels. Explain why you selected the method of service accumulation.

Present any emission test data you used for this.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> State that you operated your emission-data engines as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Present emission data for HC, NOX, PM, and CO on an emission-data engine to show your engines meet emission standards as specified in Sec. Sec.  1042.101 or 1042.104. Note that you must submit PM data for all engines, whether or not a PM standard applies. Show emission figures before and after applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors for each pollutant and for each engine. If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for example, high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuel), you need to submit test data only for one grade, unless the regulations of this part specify otherwise for your engine. Include emission results for each mode for Category 3 engines or for other engines if you do discrete-mode testing under Sec.  1042.505. Note that Sec. Sec.  1042.235 and 1042.245 allows you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, state that all the engines in the engine family comply with the applicable not-to-exceed emission standards in Sec.  1042.101 for all normal operation and use when tested as specified in Sec.  1042.515. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support your statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Report test results as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report all test results involving measurement of pollutants for which emission standards apply.
