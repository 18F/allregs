under a TERA adequately document essential transactions, furnish information necessary to protect its legal and financial rights, and enable the Secretary to discharge the trust responsibility if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any other party violates the terms of any lease, business agreement, or right-of-way; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any provision of a lease, business agreement or right-of-way violates the TERA.</p>
