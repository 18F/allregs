                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preventers. (1) When preventers are used they shall be of sufficient strength for the intended purpose. They shall be secured to the head of the boom independent of working guys unless, for cast fittings, the strength of the fitting exceeds the total strength of all lines secured to it. Any tails, fittings, or other means of making the preventers fast on the deck shall provide strength equal to that of the preventer itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When preventers are used they shall be of sufficient strength for the intended purpose.

Any tails, fittings, or other means of making the preventers fast on the deck shall provide strength equal to that of the preventer itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wire rope clips or knots shall not be used to form eyes in, nor to join sections of, preventer guys.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stoppers. (1) Chain topping lift stoppers shall be in good condition, equipped with fiber tails, and long enough to allow not fewer than three half-hitches in the chain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chain topping lift stoppers shall be in good condition, equipped with fiber tails, and long enough to allow not fewer than three half-hitches in the chain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chain stoppers shall be shackled or otherwise secured so that their links are not bent by being passed around fittings. The point of attachment shall be of sufficient strength and so placed that the stoppers are in line with the normal topping lift lead at the time the stopper is applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Patent stoppers of the clamp type shall be appropriate for the size of the rope used. Clamps shall be in good condition and free of any substance that would prevent their being drawn tight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Falls. (1) The end of the winch fall shall be secured to the drum by clamps, U-bolts, shackles, or other equally strong methods. Fiber rope fastenings shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The end of the winch fall shall be secured to the drum by clamps, U-bolts, shackles, or other equally strong methods. Fiber rope fastenings shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Winch falls shall not be used with fewer than three turns on the winch drum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Eyes in the ends of wire rope cargo falls shall not be formed by knots and, in single part falls, shall not be formed by wire rope clips.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the design of the winch permits, the fall shall be wound on the drum so that the cargo hook rises when the winch control lever is pulled back and lowers when the lever is pushed forward.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Heel blocks. (1) When an employee works in the bight formed by the heel block, a preventer at least three-quarters of an inch (1.91 cm) in diameter wire rope shall be securely rigged, or equally effective means shall be taken, to hold the block and fall if the heel block attachments fail. Where physical limitations prohibit the fitting of a wire rope preventer of the required size, two turns of a one-half inch (1.27 cm) diameter wire rope shall be sufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an employee works in the bight formed by the heel block, a preventer at least three-quarters of an inch (1.91 cm) in diameter wire rope shall be securely rigged, or equally effective means shall be taken, to hold the block and fall if the heel block attachments fail.

This requirement shall not apply when the heel block is at least 10 feet (3.05 m) above the deck when at its lowest point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coaming rollers. Portable coaming rollers shall be secured by wire preventers in addition to the regular coaming clamps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cargo hooks. Cargo hooks shall be as close to the junction of the falls as the assembly permits, but never farther than two feet (.61 m) from it. Exception: This provision shall not apply when the construction of the vessel and the operation in progress are such that fall angles are less than 120 degrees. Overhaul chains shall not be shortened by bolting or knotting.
