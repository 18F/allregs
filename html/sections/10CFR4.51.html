                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an opportunity for hearing is required by Sec. 4.48,  the responsible NRC official shall serve on the applicant or recipient,  by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice of  opportunity for hearing which will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inform the applicant or recipient of his right within twenty  (20) days of the date of the notice of opportunity for hearing, or such  other period as may be specified in the notice, to request a hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set forth the alleged item or items of noncompliance with this  subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State that compliance with this subpart may be effected by an  order providing for the termination of or refusal to grant or to  continue assistance, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide that the applicant or recipient may file a written  answer to the notice of opportunity for hearing under oath or  affirmation within twenty (20) days of its date, or such other period as  may be specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant or recipient may respond to a notice of  opportunity for hearing by filing a written answer under oath or  affirmation. The answer shall specifically admit or deny each  allegation, or, where the applicant or recipient does not have knowledge  or information sufficient to form a belief, the answer may so state and  the statements shall have the effect of a denial. Allegations of fact  not denied shall be deemed to be admitted. The answer shall separately  state and identify matters alleged as affirmative defenses and may also  set forth the matters of fact and law on which the applicant or  recipient relies. The answer may request a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the answer requests a hearing, the Commission will issue a  notice of hearing specifying:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The time, place, and nature thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is  to be held; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The matters of fact and law asserted or to be considered. The  time and place of hearing will be fixed with due regard for the  convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives and  for the public interest. An answer to a notice of hearing is not  required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An applicant or recipient may file an answer, and waive or fail  to request a hearing, without waiving the requirement for findings of  fact and conclusions of law or the right to seek Commission review in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 4.71 through 4.74. At the  time an answer is filed the applicant or recipient may also submit  written information or argument for the record if he does not request a  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An answer or stipulation may consent to the entry of an order in  substantially the form set forth in the notice of opportunity for  hearing; such order may be entered by the responsible Commission  official. The consent of the applicant or recipient to the entry of an  order shall constitute a waiver by him of a right to: (1) A hearing  under the Act and Sec. 4.48, (2) findings of fact and conclusions of  law, and (3) seek Commission review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The failure of an applicant or recipient to file an answer  within the period prescribed, or, if he requests a hearing, his failure  to appear therefor, shall constitute a waiver by him of a right to: (1)  A hearing under the Act and Sec. 4.48, (2) conclusions of law, and (3)  seek Commission review. In the event of such waiver, the responsible NRC  official may find the facts on the basis of the record available and  enter an order in substantially the form set forth in the notice of  opportunity for hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An order entered in accordance with paragraph (e) or (f) of this  section shall constitute the final decision of the Commission, unless  the Commission, on its own motion, within forty-five (45) days after  entry of the order, issues its own decision, which shall then constitute  the final decision of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A copy of an order entered by the responsible NRC official shall  be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Nothing in this section shall be deemed to place the burden of  proof on the applicant or recipient.
