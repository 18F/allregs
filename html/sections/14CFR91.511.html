However, a receiver that  can receive both communications and required navigational signals may be  used in place of a separate communications receiver and a separate  navigational signal receiver or unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (a)(2) of this  section, a receiver or electronic navigation unit is independent if the  function of any part   of it does not depend on the functioning of any part of another receiver  or electronic navigation unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section,  a person may operate an airplane on which no passengers are carried from  a place where repairs or replacement cannot be made to a place where  they can be made, if not more than one of each of the dual items of  radio communication and navigational equipment specified in paragraphs  (a)(1) (i) through (iv) and (a)(2) of this section malfunctions or  becomes inoperative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section,  when both VHF and HF communications equipment are required for the route  and the airplane has two VHF transmitters and two VHF receivers for  communications, only one HF transmitter and one HF receiver is required  for communications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As used in this section, the term shore means that area of the  land adjacent to the water which is above the high-water mark and  excludes land areas which are intermittently under water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section, a person may operate in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea,  and the Atlantic Ocean west of a line which extends from 444700" N /  670000" W to 390000" N / 670000" W to 383000" N / 600000" W  south along the 600000" W longitude line to the point where the line  intersects with the northern coast of South America, when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A single long-range navigation system is installed, operational,  and appropriate for the route; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flight conditions and the aircraft's capabilities are such that  no more than a 30-minute gap in two-way radio very high frequency  communications is expected to exist.
