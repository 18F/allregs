                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Refinancings. A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation that was subject to this subpart is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same consumer. A refinancing is a new transaction requiring new disclosures to the consumer. The new finance charge shall include any unearned portion of the old finance charge that is not credited to the existing obligation. The following shall not be treated as a refinancing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A renewal of a single payment obligation with no change in the original terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A reduction in the annual percentage rate with a corresponding change in the payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An agreement involving a court proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A change in the payment schedule or a change in collateral requirements as a result of the consumer's default or delinquency, unless the rate is increased, or the new amount financed exceeds the unpaid balance plus earned finance charge and premiums for continuation of insurance of the types described in Sec. 1026.4(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The renewal of optional insurance purchased by the consumer and added to an existing transaction, if disclosures relating to the initial purchase were provided as required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assumptions. An assumption occurs when a creditor expressly agrees in writing with a subsequent consumer to accept that consumer as a primary obligor on an existing residential mortgage transaction. Before the assumption occurs, the creditor shall make new disclosures to the subsequent consumer, based on the remaining obligation. If the finance charge originally imposed on the existing obligation was an add-on or discount finance charge, the creditor need only disclose:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The unpaid balance of the obligation assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total charges imposed by the creditor in connection with the assumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The information required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(k), (l), (m), and (n).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The annual percentage rate originally imposed on the obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The payment schedule under Sec. 1026.18(g) and the total of payments under Sec. 1026.18(h) based on the remaining obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rate adjustments with a corresponding change in payment. The creditor, assignee, or servicer of an adjustable-rate mortgage shall provide consumers with disclosures, as described in this paragraph (c), in connection with the adjustment of interest rates pursuant to the loan contract that results in a corresponding adjustment to the payment. To the extent that other provisions of this subpart C govern the disclosures required by this paragraph (c), those provisions apply to assignees and servicers as well as to creditors. The disclosures required by this paragraph (c) also shall be provided for an interest rate adjustment resulting from the conversion of an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate transaction, if that interest rate adjustment results in a corresponding payment change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coverage--(i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an adjustable-rate mortgage or ``ARM'' is a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling in which the annual percentage rate may increase after consummation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exemptions. The requirements of this paragraph (c) do not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> ARMs with terms of one year or less;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The first interest rate adjustment to an ARM if the first payment at the adjusted level is due within 210 days after consummation and the new interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d) was not an estimate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The creditor, assignee or servicer of an adjustable-rate mortgage when the servicer on the loan is subject to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA) (15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq.) with regard to the loan and the consumer has sent a notification pursuant to FDCPA section 805(c) (15 U.S.C. 1692c(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing and content. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the disclosures required by this paragraph (c) shall be provided to consumers at least 60, but no more than 120, days before the first payment at the adjusted level is due. The disclosures shall be provided to consumers at least 25, but no more than 120, days before the first payment at the adjusted level is due for ARMs with uniformly scheduled interest rate adjustments occurring every 60 days or more frequently and for ARMs originated prior to January 10, 2015 in which the loan contract requires the adjusted interest rate and payment to be calculated based on the index figure available as of a date that is less than 45 days prior to the adjustment date. The disclosures shall be provided to consumers as soon as practicable, but not less than 25 days before the first payment at the adjusted level is due, for the first adjustment to an ARM if it occurs within 60 days of consummation and the new interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d) was an estimate. The disclosures required by this paragraph (c) shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement providing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An explanation that under the terms of the consumer's adjustable-rate mortgage, the specific time period in which the current interest rate has been in effect is ending and the interest rate and mortgage payment will change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The effective date of the interest rate adjustment and when additional future interest rate adjustments are scheduled to occur; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other changes to loan terms, features, or options taking effect on the same date as the interest rate adjustment, such as the expiration of interest-only or payment-option features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A table containing the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The current and new interest rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The current and new payments and the date the first new payment is due; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For interest-only or negatively-amortizing payments, the amount of the current and new payment allocated to principal, interest, and taxes and insurance in escrow, as applicable. The current payment allocation disclosed shall be the payment allocation for the last payment prior to the date of the disclosure. The new payment allocation disclosed shall be the expected payment allocation for the first payment for which the new interest rate will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An explanation of how the interest rate is determined, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The specific index or formula used in making interest rate adjustments and a source of information about the index or formula; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The type and amount of any adjustment to the index, including any margin and an explanation that the margin is the addition of a certain number of percentage points to the index, and any application of previously foregone interest rate increases from past interest rate adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any limits on the interest rate or payment increases at each interest rate adjustment and over the life of the loan, as applicable, including the extent to which such limits result in the creditor, assignee, or servicer foregoing any increase in the interest rate and the earliest date that such foregone interest rate increases may apply to future interest rate adjustments, subject to those limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An explanation of how the new payment is determined, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The index or formula used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any adjustment to the index or formula, such as the addition of a margin or the application of any previously

foregone interest rate increases from past interest rate adjustments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The loan balance expected on the date of the interest rate adjustment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The length of the remaining loan term expected on the date of the interest rate adjustment and any change in the term of the loan caused by the adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If applicable, a statement that the new payment will not be allocated to pay loan principal and will not reduce the loan balance. If the new payment will result in negative amortization, a statement that the new payment will not be allocated to pay loan principal and will pay only part of the loan interest, thereby adding to the balance of the loan. If the new payment will result in negative amortization as a result of the interest rate adjustment, the statement shall set forth the payment required to amortize fully the remaining balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The circumstances under which any prepayment penalty, as defined in Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(i), may be imposed, such as when paying the loan in full or selling or refinancing the principal dwelling; the time period during which such a penalty may be imposed; and a statement that the consumer may contact the servicer for additional information, including the maximum amount of the penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Format. (i) The disclosures required by this paragraph (c) shall be provided in the form of a table and in the same order as, and with headings and format substantially similar to, forms H-4(D)(1) and (2) in appendix H to this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The disclosures required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be in the form of a table located within the table described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. These disclosures shall appear in the same order as, and with headings and format substantially similar to, the table inside the larger table in forms H-4(D)(1) and (2) in appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Initial rate adjustment. The creditor, assignee, or servicer of an adjustable-rate mortgage shall provide consumers with disclosures, as described in this paragraph (d), in connection with the initial interest rate adjustment pursuant to the loan contract. To the extent that other provisions of this subpart C govern the disclosures required by this paragraph (d), those provisions apply to assignees and servicers as well as to creditors. The disclosures required by this paragraph (d) shall be provided as a separate document from other documents provided by the creditor, assignee, or servicer. The disclosures shall be provided to consumers at least 210, but no more than 240, days before the first payment at the adjusted level is due. If the first payment at the adjusted level is due within the first 210 days after consummation, the disclosures shall be provided at consummation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coverage--(i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an adjustable-rate mortgage or ``ARM'' is a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling in which the annual percentage rate may increase after consummation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exemptions. The requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply to ARMs with terms of one year or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content. If the new interest rate (or the new payment calculated from the new interest rate) is not known as of the date of the disclosure, an estimate shall be disclosed and labeled as such. This estimate shall be based on the calculation of the index reported in the source of information described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section within fifteen business days prior to the date of the disclosure. The disclosures required by this paragraph (d) shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date of the disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement providing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An explanation that under the terms of the consumer's adjustable-rate mortgage, the specific time period in which the current interest rate has been in effect is ending and that any change in the interest rate may result in a change in the mortgage payment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The effective date of the interest rate adjustment and when additional future interest rate adjustments are scheduled to occur; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other changes to loan terms, features, or options taking effect on

the same date as the interest rate adjustment, such as the expiration of interest-only or payment-option features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A table containing the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The current and new interest rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The current and new payments and the date the first new payment is due; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For interest-only or negatively-amortizing payments, the amount of the current and new payment allocated to principal, interest, and taxes and insurance in escrow, as applicable.
