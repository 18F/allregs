                            <p class="depth0">A conversion is an acquisition within the meaning of the act.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Assume that acquiring person ``A'' wishes to convert convertible voting securities of issuer X, and is to receive common stock of X valued in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). If ``A'' and ``X'' satisfy the criteria of Section 7A(a)(1) and Section 7A(a)(2)(B)(ii), then ``A'' and ``X'' must file notification and observe the waiting period before ``A'' completes the acquisition of the X common stock, unless exempted by Section 7A(c) or the regulations in this part. Since Sec. 801.30 applies, the waiting period begins upon notification by ``A,'' and ``X'' must file notification within 15 days.
