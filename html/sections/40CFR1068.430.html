                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We may suspend your certificate of conformity for a family if it fails the SEA under Sec.  1068.420. The suspension may apply to all facilities producing engines/equipment from a family even if you find noncompliant engines/equipment only at one facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will tell you in writing if we suspend your certificate in whole or in part. We will not suspend a certificate until at least 15 days after the family fails the SEA. The suspension is effective when you receive our notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may ask for a hearing to determine whether the tests and sampling methods were proper (see subpart G of this part) up to 15 days after we suspend the certificate for a family. If we agree that we used erroneous information in deciding to suspend the certificate before a hearing is held, we will reinstate the certificate.</p>
