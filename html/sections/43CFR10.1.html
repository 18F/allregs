                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. These regulations carry out provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101-601; 25 U.S.C. 3001-3013;104 Stat. 3048-3058). These regulations develop a systematic process for determining the rights of lineal descendants and Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to certain Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony with which they are affiliated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) These regulations pertain to the identification and appropriate disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> These regulations pertain to the identification and appropriate disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In Federal possession or control; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the possession or control of any institution or State or local government receiving Federal funds; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently on Federal or tribal lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These regulations apply to human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony which are indigenous to Alaska, Hawaii, and the continental United States, but not to territories of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Throughout this part are decision points which determine how this part applies in particular circumstances, e.g., a decision as to whether a museum ``controls'' human remains and cultural objects within the meaning of the regulations, or a decision as to whether an object is a ``human remain,'' ``funerary object,'' ``sacred object,'' or ``object of cultural patrimony'' within the meaning of the regulations. Any final determination making the Act or this part inapplicable is subject to review under section 15 of the Act. With respect to Federal agencies, the final denial of a request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization for the repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony brought under, and in compliance with, the Act and this part constitutes a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned control number 1024-0144. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
