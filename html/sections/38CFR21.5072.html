                            <p class="depth0">The Department of Veterans Affairs shall determine the entitlement  charge for each payment in the same manner for all individuals  regardless of whether they are on active duty. Unless the circumstances  described in paragraph (i) of this section apply to a servicemember or  veteran, VA will use paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section to  determine an entitlement charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (i) of  this section, VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual who  is a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each monthly benefit  paid to him or her.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual  who is other than a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each sum  of money paid equivalent to what the individual would have been paid had  he or she been a full-time student for 1 month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the computation results in a period of time other than a  full month, the entitlement charge will be prorated.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Secondary school program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs  will make no charge against the entitlement of an individual:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Who is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education  leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whose educational assistance allowance is the monthly rate of  the tuition and fees being charged to him or her for the course.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department of Veterans Affairs will make a charge (in the  same manner as for any other residence training) against the entitlement  of an individual who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education leading  to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Elects to receive educational assistance allowance calculated  according to Sec. 21.5136.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3241, 3491)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correspondence training courses. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A charge against the period  of entitlement for a program consisting exclusively of correspondence  training will be made on the basis of 1 month for each sum of money paid  equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined  under Sec. 21.5138(a)(2)(viii), which is paid to the individual as an  educational assistance allowance for this training. When computation  results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be  prorated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time  that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums,  the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly  rate arrived at by applying the formula is determined to be $150 at the  time a benefit program for correspondence training is computed, the  individual will be charged 1 month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If  a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment  for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged  for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's  entitlement may vary from payment to payment.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Apprenticeship or other on-job training. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The VA will  determine the entitlement charge for a veteran in apprenticeship or  other on-job training as stated in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entitlement charge will be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 75 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's  monthly payment is based upon 75 percent of the monthly benefit  otherwise payable to him or her;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 55 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's  monthly payment is based upon 55 percent of the monthly benefit  otherwise payable to him or her; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 35 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's  monthly payment is based upon 35 percent of the monthly benefit  otherwise payable to him or her.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The charge against the veteran's entitlement will be prorated  if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The veteran's enrollment period ends in the middle of a month,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The veteran's monthly rate is reduced in the middle of a month,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The veteran's monthly payment is reduced because he or she  worked less than 120 hours during the month. In this instance the number  of hours worked will be rounded to the nearest multiple of eight, and  the entitlement charge will be reduced proportionately.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3233(c); Pub. L. 99-576)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cooperative training. VA will make a charge against entitlement  of 80 percent of a month for each month for which a veteran is paid  educational assistance allowance at the cooperative training rate as  provided in Sec. 21.5138(a). If the veteran is paid for a partial month  of training, the entitlement charge will be prorated.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(d); Pub. L. 100-689)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Training while the veteran is incarcerated. If the veteran must  be paid educational assistance allowance at a reduced rate because he or  she is incarcerated as provided in Sec. 21.5139 of this part, VA will  make a charge against entitlement of one month for each amount of  educational assistance allowance paid to the veteran which is the  equivalent of one month's benefits as provided in Sec. 21.5138 of this  part for the appropriate type of training pursued.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(e); Pub. L. 100-689)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Tutorial assistance. If an individual is paid tutorial  assistance as provided in Sec. 21.5141 of this part, the following  provisions will apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There will be no charge to entitlement for the first $600 of  tutorial assistance paid to an individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement for each  amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600  that is equal to   the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise  eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of a residence course as  provided in Sec. 21.5138(c) of this part. When the amount of tutorial  assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 is less than the  amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise  eligible to receive, the entitlement charge will be prorated.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3234; Pub. L. 100-689)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Flight training courses. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A charge against the period of  entitlement for pursuit of a flight training course will be one month  for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of  entitlement as determined under Sec. 21.5138(a)(5)(viii). When this  computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the  charge will be prorated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time  that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums,  the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly  rate arrived at under Sec. 21.5138(a)(5)(viii) is $150 at the time  educational assistance allowance is paid for a period of flight  training, the individual will be charged one month of entitlement for  each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a  subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the  entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of  each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.
