                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section no cable operator  shall devote more than 40 percent of its activated channels to the  carriage of national video programming services owned by the cable  operator or in which the cable operator has an attributable interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The channel occupancy limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this  section shall apply only to channel capacity up to 75 channels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A cable operator may devote two additional channels or up to 45  percent of its channel capacity, whichever is greater, to the carriage  of video programming services owned by the cable operator or in which  the cable operator has an attributable interest provided such video  programming services are minority-controlled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cable operators carrying video programming services owned by the  cable operator or in which the cable operator holds an attributable  interest in excess of limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section  as of December 4, 1992, shall not be precluded by the restrictions in  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minority-controlled means more than 50 percent owned by one or  more members of a minority group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Minority means Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native,  Asian and Pacific Islander.</p><p class="depth0">Note 1: Attributable interest shall be defined by reference to the  criteria set forth in Notes 1 through 5 to Sec.  76.501 provided  however, that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notes 2(f) and 2(g) to Sec.  76.501 to shall not apply;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to Note 2(i) to Sec.  76.501, a limited partnership  interest shall be attributed to a limited partner unless that partner is  not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or  operation of the video programming-related activities of the partnership  and the relevant entity so certifies. An interest in a Limited Liability  Company (``LLC'') or Registered Limited Liability Partnership (``RLLP'')  shall be attributed to the interest holder unless that interest holder  is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or  operation of the video programming-related activities of the partnership  and the relevant entity so certifies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a limited partnership, in order for an entity to  make the certification set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it  must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited  partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from  attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material  involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of  the video programming activities of the partnership. In the case of an  LLC or RLLP, in order for an entity to make the certification set forth  in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it must verify that the  organizational document, with respect to the particular interest holder  exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt interest holder has  no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or  operation of the video programming activities of the LLC or RLLP. The  criteria which would assume adequate insulation for purposes of these  certifications are described in the Report and Order, FCC No. 99-288, CS  Docket No. 98-82 (released October 20, 1999). In order for the  Commission to accept the certification, the certification must be  accompanied by facts, e.g. in the form of documents, affidavits or  declarations, that demonstrate that these insulation criteria are met.  Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or  partnership agreement, or other organizational document in the case of  an LLC or RLLP, however, no such certification shall be made if the  individual or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of  any material involvement of the limited partners, or other interest  holders in the case of an LLC or RLLP, in the management or operation of  the video-programming activities of the partnership or LLC or RLLP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an LLC or RLLP, the entity seeking insulation  shall certify, in addition, that the relevant state statute authorizing  LLCs permits an LLC member to insulate itself as required by our  criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Officers and directors of an entity covered by this rule are  considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with which they  are so associated. If any such entity engages in activities other than  video-programming activities, it may request the Commission to waive  attribution for any officer or director whose duties and  responsibilities are wholly unrelated to the entity's video-programming  activities. In the case of common or appointed directors and officers,  if common or appointed directors or officers have duties and  responsibilities that are wholly unrelated to video-programming  activities for both entities, the relevant entity may request the  Commission to waive attribution of the director or officer. The officers  and directors of a parent company of a video-programming business, with  an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed  to have a cognizable interest in   the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the officer or  director involved are wholly unrelated to the video-programming  subsidiary, and a certification properly documenting this fact is  submitted to the Commission. The officers and directors of a sister  corporation of a cable system shall not be attributed with ownership of  that entity by virtue of such status.</p><p class="depth2">Note 2 to Sec.  76.504: Section 76.1710 contains recordkeeping  requirements for cable operators with regard to attributable interests.
