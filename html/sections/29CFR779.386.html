Sec. 779.387  ``Restaurant'' exemption under section 13(b) (8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As amended in 1966, the Act, in section 13(b) (8), exempts from  its overtime pay provisions ``any employee employed by an establishment  which is a * * * restaurant''. The term restaurant as used in section  13(b)(8) of the Act means an establishment which is primarily engaged in  selling and serving to purchasers at retail prepared food and beverages  for immediate consumption on the premises. This includes such  establishments commonly known as lunch counters, refreshment stands,  cafes, cafeterias, coffee shops, diners, dining rooms, lunch rooms, or  tea rooms. The term ``restaurant'' does not include drinking  establishments, such as bars or cocktail lounges, whose sales of  alcoholic beverages exceed the receipts from sales of prepared foods and  nonalcoholic beverages. Certain food or beverage service employees of  establishments such as bars and cocktail lounges, however, may be exempt  under section 13(b)(18).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(8)</em>, nor are the dining facilities of a boarding school,  college or university which serve its students and faculty, nor are the  luncheon facilities provided for private and public day school students,  nor are other institutional food service facilities providing long-term  meal service to stable groups of individuals as an incident to  institutional operations in a manner wholly dissimilar to the typical  transactions between a restaurant and its customers.</p>
