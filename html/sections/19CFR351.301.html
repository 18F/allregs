                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section sets forth the time limits for submitting factual information, as defined by Sec. 351.102(b)(21). The Department obtains most of its factual information in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings from submissions made by interested parties during the course of the proceeding. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may request any person to submit factual information at any time during a proceeding or provide additional opportunities to submit factual information. Section 351.302 sets forth the procedures for requesting an extension of such time limits, and provides that, unless expressly precluded by statute, the Secretary may, for good cause, extend any time limit established in the Department's regulations. Section 351.303 contains the procedural rules regarding filing (including procedures for filing on non-business days), format, translation, service, and certification of documents. In the Secretary's written request to an interested party for a response to a questionnaire or for other factual information, the Secretary will specify the following: The time limit for the response; the information to be provided; the form and manner in which the interested party must submit the information; and that failure to submit the requested information in the requested form and manner by the date specified may result in use of the facts available under section 776 of the Act and Sec. 351.308.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of factual information. Every submission of factual information must be accompanied by a written explanation identifying the subsection of Sec. 351.102(b)(21) under which the information is being submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an interested party states that the information is submitted under Sec. 351.102(b)(21)(v), the party must explain why the information does not satisfy the definitions described in Sec. 351.102(b)(21)(i)-(iv).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the factual information is being submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information on the record, the submitter must provide a written explanation identifying the information which is already on the record that the factual information seeks to rebut, clarify, or correct, including the name of the interested party that submitted the information and the date on which the information was submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time limits. The type of factual information determines the time limit for submission to the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factual information submitted in response to questionnaires. During a proceeding, the Secretary may issue to any person questionnaires, which includes both initial and supplemental questionnaires. The Secretary will not consider or retain in the official record of the proceeding unsolicited questionnaire responses, except as provided under Sec. 351.204(d)(2), or untimely filed questionnaire responses. The Secretary will reject any untimely filed or unsolicited questionnaire response and provide, to the extent practicable, written

notice stating the reasons for rejection (see Sec. 351.302(d)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initial questionnaire responses are due 30 days from the date of receipt of such questionnaire. The time limit for response to individual sections of the questionnaire, if the Secretary requests a separate response to such sections, may be less than the 30 days allotted for response to the full questionnaire. In general, the date of receipt will be considered to be seven days from the date on which the initial questionnaire was transmitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Supplemental questionnaire responses are due on the date specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A notification by an interested party, under section 782(c)(1) of the Act, of difficulties in submitting information in response to a questionnaire issued by the Secretary is to be submitted in writing within 14 days after the date of the questionnaire or, if the questionnaire is due in 14 days or less, within the time specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A respondent interested party may request in writing that the Secretary conduct a questionnaire presentation. The Secretary may conduct a questionnaire presentation if the Secretary notifies the government of the affected country and that government does not object.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Factual information submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct questionnaire responses. Within 14 days after an initial questionnaire response and within 10 days after a supplemental questionnaire response has been filed with the Department, an interested party other than the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the questionnaire response. Within seven days of the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction to a questionnaire response, the original submitter of the questionnaire response is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification or correction. The Secretary will reject any untimely filed rebuttal, clarification, or correction submission and provide, to the extent practicable, written notice stating the reasons for rejection (see Sec. 351.302). If insufficient time remains before the due date for the final determination or final results of review, the Secretary may specify shorter deadlines under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factual information submitted in support of allegations. Factual information submitted in support of allegations must be accompanied by a summary, not to exceed five pages, of the allegation and supporting data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Market viability and the basis for determining normal value. Allegations regarding market viability in an antidumping investigation or administrative review, including the exceptions in Sec. 351.404(c)(2), are due, with all supporting factual information, 10 days after the respondent interested party files the response to the relevant section of the questionnaire, unless the Secretary alters this time limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sales at prices below the cost of production. Allegations of sales at prices below the cost of production made by the petitioner or other domestic interested party are due within:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In an antidumping investigation, on a country-wide basis, 20 days after the date on which the initial questionnaire was issued to any person, unless the Secretary alters this time limit; or, on a company-specific basis, 20 days after a respondent interested party files the response to the relevant section of the questionnaire, unless the relevant questionnaire response is, in the Secretary's view, incomplete, in which case the Secretary will determine the time limit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In an administrative review, new shipper review, or changed circumstances review, on a company-specific basis, 20 days after a respondent interested party files the response to the relevant section of the questionnaire, unless the relevant questionnaire response is, in the Secretary's view, incomplete, in which case the Secretary will determine the time limit; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In an expedited antidumping review, on a company-specific basis, 10 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Purchases of major inputs from an affiliated party at prices below the affiliated party's cost of production. An allegation of purchases of major inputs from an affiliated party at prices below the affiliated party's cost of production made by the petitioner or other domestic interested party is due within 20 days after a respondent interested party files the response to the relevant section of the questionnaire, unless the relevant questionnaire response is, in the Secretary's view, incomplete, in which case the Secretary will determine the time limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Countervailable subsidy; upstream subsidy. A countervailable subsidy allegation made by the petitioner or other domestic interested party is due no later than:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In a countervailing duty investigation, 40 days before the scheduled date of the preliminary determination, unless the Secretary extends this time limit for good cause; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In an administrative review, new shipper review, or changed circumstances review, 20 days after all responses to the initial questionnaire are filed with the Department, unless the Secretary alters this time limit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Exception for upstream subsidy allegation in an investigation. In a countervailing duty investigation, an allegation of upstream subsidies made by the petitioner or other domestic interested party is due no later than 60 days after the date of the preliminary determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other allegations. An interested party may submit factual information in support of other allegations not specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)-(iv) of this section. Upon receipt of factual information under this subsection, the Secretary will issue a memorandum accepting or rejecting the information and, to the extent practicable, will provide written notice stating the reasons for rejection. If the Secretary accepts the information, the Secretary will issue a schedule providing deadlines for submission of factual information to rebut, clarify or correct the factual information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Rebuttal, clarification, or correction of factual information submitted in support of allegations. An interested party is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in support of allegations 10 days after the date such factual information is served on an interested party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factual information submitted to value factors under Sec. 351.408(c) or to measure the adequacy of remuneration under Sec. 351.511(a)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Antidumping or countervailing duty investigations. All submissions of factual information to value factors of production under Sec. 351.408(c) in an antidumping investigation, or to measure the adequacy of remuneration under Sec. 351.511(a)(2) in a countervailing duty investigation, are due no later than 30 days before the scheduled date of the preliminary determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Administrative review, new shipper review, or changed circumstances review. All submissions of factual information to value factors under Sec. 351.408(c), or to measure the adequacy of remuneration under Sec. 351.511(a)(2), are due no later than 30 days before the scheduled date of the preliminary results of review; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expedited antidumping review. All submissions of factual information to value factors under Sec. 351.408(c) are due on a date specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Rebuttal, clarification, or correction of factual information submitted to value factors under Sec. 351.408(c) or to measure the adequacy of remuneration under Sec. 351.511(a)(2). An interested party is permitted one opportunity to submit publicly available information to rebut, clarify, or correct such factual information submitted pursuant to Sec. 351.408(c) or Sec. 351.511(a)(2) 10 days after the date such factual information is served on the interested party. An interested party may not submit additional, previously absent-from-the-record alternative surrogate value information under this subsection. Additionally, all factual information submitted under this subsection must be accompanied by a written explanation identifying what information already on the record of the ongoing proceeding the factual information is rebutting, clarifying, or correcting. Information submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted pursuant to Sec. 351.408(c) will not be used to value factors under Sec. 351.408(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Factual information placed on the record of the proceeding by the Department. The Department may place factual information on the record of the proceeding at any time. An interested party is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information placed on the record of the proceeding by the Department by a date specified by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Factual information not directly responsive to or relating to paragraphs (c)(1)-(4) of this section).
