                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purposes of the standards in this chapter, the terms  ``claim'' and ``debt'' are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to  an amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an  agency official to be due the United States from any person,  organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes  of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms ``claim'' and  ``debt'' include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person  to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the  District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin  Islands, the   Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A debt is ``delinquent'' if it has not been paid by the date  specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or  applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment  agreement), unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In parts 900-904 of this chapter, words in the plural form shall  include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine  gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms ``includes''  and ``including'' do not exclude matters not listed but do include  matters that are in the same general class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recoupment is a special method for adjusting debts arising under  the same transaction or occurrence. For example, obligations arising  under the same contract generally are subject to recoupment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of the standards in this chapter, unless otherwise  stated, ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Treasury or the  Secretary's delegate.</p>
