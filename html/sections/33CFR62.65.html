As a result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properly and on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will be enhanced if persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, off station, or showing characteristics other than those advertised in the Light List, or other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard. When making the report to the Coast Guard the mariner should consult the Light List to ensure the correct geographical information is used due to the similarity of names and geographical areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Radio messages should be prefixed ``Coast Guard'' and transmitted directly to a Government shore radio station listed in Chapter three of Radio Navigation Aids Publication, 117, for relay to the relevant District Commander.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Telephone, e-mail, or facsimile messages may also be used to advise the nearest Coast Guard unit of defects or discrepancies in aids to navigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Via our Web portal at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov.
