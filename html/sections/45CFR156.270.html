A QHP issuer must establish a standard

This policy for the termination of enrollment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must include the grace period for enrollees receiving advance payments of the premium tax credits as described in paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must be applied uniformly to enrollees in similar circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grace period for recipients of advance payments of the premium tax credit. A QHP issuer must provide a grace period of three consecutive months if an enrollee receiving advance payments of the premium tax credit has previously paid at least one full month's premium during the benefit year. During the grace period, the QHP issuer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pay all appropriate claims for services rendered to the enrollee during the first month of the grace period and may pend claims for services rendered to the enrollee in the second and third months of the grace period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify HHS of such non-payment; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notify providers of the possibility for denied claims when an enrollee is in the second and third months of the grace period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Advance payments of the premium tax credit.

If an enrollee is delinquent on premium payment, the QHP issuer must provide the enrollee with notice of such payment delinquency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exhaustion of grace period. If an enrollee receiving advance payments of the premium tax credit exhausts the 3-month grace period in paragraph (d) of this section without paying all outstanding premiums, the QHP issuer must terminate the enrollee's enrollment through the Exchange on the effective date described in Sec. 155.430(d)(4) of this subchapter, provided that the QHP issuer meets the notice requirement specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records of termination of coverage.
