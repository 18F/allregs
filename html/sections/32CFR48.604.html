                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A retired member who is participating in the Plan without  inclusion of former option 4, which provided for restoration of retired  pay when no eligible beneficiary remained in his election, may before  September 1, 1969, elect to have that option included in his election.  The election to include such option 4 becomes effective on the first day  of the month following the month in which that election was made. The  retired member must on or before the effective date agree to pay to the  Treasury both the total additional amount to cover the option had it  been effective when he retired, and the interest which would have  accrued on the additional amount up to the effective date of the new  option 4. No such additional amount (except interest) shall accrue for  months after the first month for which the individual had no eligible  beneficiary. However, if undue hardship or financial burden would  result, payments may be made in from 2 to 12 monthly installments when  the monthly amount involved is $25 or less, or in from 2 to 36  installments when the monthly amounts involved exceed $25. No amounts by  which a member's retired pay was reduced may be refunded to, or credited  on behalf of, the retired member by virtue of an application made by him  under this section. A retired member who does not make the additional  election provided under this section within the time limits will not be  allowed to reduce an annuity or withdraw from participation in the Plan  as provided by Sec. 48.406.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Members who have elected and are not yet retired will  automatically participate under the provisions of Sec. 48.201.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Elections in effect on August 13, 1968, will remain under the  cost tables applicable on the date of the member's retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any member who has filed an election, modification, or  revocation prior to August 13, 1968, may before September 1, 1969,  submit a written application to the Secretary concerned requesting that  such election, modification, or revocation remain under the time-of- election provisions of the law applicable on the date it was filed.</p>
