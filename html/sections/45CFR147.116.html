                                Sec. 147.116  Prohibition on waiting periods that exceed 90 days.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> solely because individuals take, or are permitted to  take, additional time (beyond the end of the 90-day waiting period) to  elect coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Waiting period defined. For purposes of this part, a waiting  period is the period that must pass before coverage for an individual  who is otherwise eligible to enroll under the terms of a group health  plan can become effective. If an individual enrolls as a late enrollee  (as defined under Sec. 144.103 of this subchapter) or special enrollee  (as described in Sec. 146.117 of this subchapter), any period before  such late or special enrollment is not a waiting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relation to a plan's eligibility criteria--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section,  being otherwise eligible to enroll under the terms of a group health  plan means having met the plan's substantive eligibility conditions  (such as, for example, being in an eligible job classification,  achieving job-related licensure requirements specified in the plan's  terms, or satisfying a reasonable and bona fide employment-based  orientation period). Moreover, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)  and (c)(3) of this section, nothing in this section requires a plan  sponsor to offer coverage to any particular individual or class of  individuals (including, for example, part-time employees). Instead, this  section prohibits requiring otherwise eligible individuals to wait more  than 90 days before coverage is effective. See also section 4980H of the  Code and its implementing regulations for an applicable large employer's  shared responsibility to provide health coverage to full-time employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility conditions based solely on the lapse of time.  Eligibility conditions that are based solely on the lapse of a time  period are permissible for no more than 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application to variable-hour employees in cases in which a  specified number of hours of service per period is a plan eligibility  condition. If a group health plan conditions eligibility on an employee  regularly having a specified number of hours of service per period (or  working full-time), and it cannot be determined that a newly-hired  employee is reasonably expected to regularly work that number of hours  per period (or work full-time), the plan may take a reasonable period of  time, not to exceed 12 months and beginning on any date between the  employee's start date and the first day of the first calendar month  following the employee's start date, to determine whether the employee  meets the plan's eligibility condition. Except in cases in which a  waiting period that exceeds 90 days is imposed in addition to a  measurement period, the time period for determining whether such an  employee meets the plan's eligibility condition will not be considered  to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period  limitation if coverage is made effective no later than 13 months from  the employee's start date plus, if the employee's start date is not the  first day of a calendar month, the time remaining until the first day of  the next calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cumulative service requirements. If a group health plan or  health insurance   issuer conditions eligibility on an employee's having completed a number  of cumulative hours of service, the eligibility condition is not  considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting  period limitation if the cumulative hours-of-service requirement does  not exceed 1,200 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitation on orientation periods. To ensure that an  orientation period is not used as a subterfuge for the passage of time,  or designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period  limitation, an orientation period is permitted only if it does not  exceed one month. For this purpose, one month is determined by adding  one calendar month and subtracting one calendar day, measured from an  employee's start date in a position that is otherwise eligible for  coverage. For example, if an employee's start date in an otherwise  eligible position is May 3, the last permitted day of the orientation  period is June 2. Similarly, if an employee's start date in an otherwise  eligible position is October 1, the last permitted day of the  orientation period is October 31. If there is not a corresponding date  in the next calendar month upon adding a calendar month, the last  permitted day of the orientation period is the last day of the next  calendar month. For example, if the employee's start date is January 30,  the last permitted day of the orientation period is February 28 (or  February 29 in a leap year). Similarly, if the employee's start date is  August 31, the last permitted day of the orientation period is September  30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application to rehires. A plan or issuer may treat an employee  whose employment has terminated and who then is rehired as newly  eligible upon rehire and, therefore, required to meet the plan's  eligibility criteria and waiting period anew, if reasonable under the  circumstances (for example, the termination and rehire cannot be a  subterfuge to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period  limitation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Counting days. Under this section, all calendar days are counted  beginning on the enrollment date (as defined in Sec. 144.103),  including weekends and holidays. A plan or issuer that imposes a 90-day  waiting period may, for administrative convenience, choose to permit  coverage to become effective earlier than the 91st day if the 91st day  is a weekend or holiday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides that full-time  employees are eligible for coverage under the plan. Employee A begins  employment as a full-time employee on January 19.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, any waiting period for A would  begin on January 19 and may not exceed 90 days. Coverage under the plan  must become effective no later than April 19 (assuming February lasts 28  days).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides that only  employees with job title M are eligible for coverage under the plan.  Employee B begins employment with job title L on January 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, B is not eligible for coverage  under the plan, and the period while B is working with job title L and  therefore not in an eligible class of employees, is not part of a  waiting period under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as in Example 2, except that B  transfers to a new position with job title M on April 11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, B becomes eligible for coverage  on April 11, but for the waiting period. Any waiting period for B begins  on April 11 and may not exceed 90 days; therefore, coverage under the  plan must become effective no later than July 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides that only  employees who have completed specified training and achieved specified  certifications are eligible for coverage under the plan. Employee C is  hired on May 3 and meets the plan's eligibility criteria on September  22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, C becomes eligible for coverage  on September 22, but for the waiting period. Any waiting period for C  would begin on September 22 and may not exceed 90 days; therefore,  coverage under the plan must become effective no later than December 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides that employees  are eligible for coverage after one year of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the plan's eligibility condition  is based solely on the lapse of time and, therefore, is impermissible  under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because it exceeds 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer V's group health plan provides for  coverage to begin on the first day of the first payroll period on or  after the date an employee is hired and completes the applicable  enrollment forms. Enrollment forms are distributed on an employee's  start date and may be completed within   90 days. Employee D is hired and starts on October 31, which is the  first day of a pay period. D completes the enrollment forms and submits  them on the 90th day after D's start date, which is January 28. Coverage  is made effective 7 days later, February 4, which is the first day of  the next pay period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, under the terms of V's plan,  coverage may become effective as early as October 31, depending on when  D completes the applicable enrollment forms. Under the terms of the  plan, when coverage becomes effective depends solely on the length of  time taken by D to complete the enrollment materials. Therefore, under  the terms of the plan, D may elect coverage that would begin on a date  that does not exceed the 90-day waiting period limitation, and the plan  complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Under Employer W's group health plan, only  employees who are full-time (defined under the plan as regularly  averaging 30 hours of service per week) are eligible for coverage.  Employee E begins employment for Employer W on November 26 of Year 1.  E's hours are reasonably expected to vary, with an opportunity to work  between 20 and 45 hours per week, depending on shift availability and  E's availability. Therefore, it cannot be determined at E's start date  that E is reasonably expected to work full-time. Under the terms of the  plan, variable-hour employees, such as E, are eligible to enroll in the  plan if they are determined to be a full-time employee after a  measurement period of 12 months that begins on the employee's start  date. Coverage is made effective no later than the first day of the  first calendar month after the applicable enrollment forms are received.  E's 12-month measurement period ends November 25 of Year 2. E is  determined to be a full-time employee and is notified of E's plan  eligibility. If E then elects coverage, E's first day of coverage will  be January 1 of Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 7, the measurement period is  permissible because it is not considered to be designed to avoid  compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation. The plan may use a  reasonable period of time to determine whether a variable-hour employee  is a full-time employee, provided that (a) the period of time is no  longer than 12 months; (b) the period of time begins on a date between  the employee's start date and the first day of the next calendar month  (inclusive); (c) coverage is made effective no later than 13 months from  E's start date plus, if the employee's start date is not the first day  of a calendar month, the time remaining until the first day of the next  calendar month; and (d) in addition to the measurement period, no more  than 90 days elapse prior to the employee's eligibility for coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee F begins working 25 hours per week  for Employer X on January 6 and is considered a part-time employee for  purposes of X's group health plan. X sponsors a group health plan that  provides coverage to part-time employees after they have completed a  cumulative 1,200 hours of service. F satisfies the plan's cumulative  hours of service condition on December 15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 8, the cumulative hours of service  condition with respect to part-time employees is not considered to be  designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation.  Accordingly, coverage for F under the plan must begin no later than the  91st day after F completes 1,200 hours. (If the plan's cumulative hours- of-service requirement was more than 1,200 hours, the requirement would  be considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting  period limitation.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A multiemployer plan operating pursuant to an  arms-length collective bargaining agreement has an eligibility provision  that allows employees to become eligible for coverage by working a  specified number of hours of covered employment for multiple  contributing employers. The plan aggregates hours in a calendar quarter  and then, if enough hours are earned, coverage begins the first day of  the next calendar quarter. The plan also permits coverage to extend for  the next full calendar quarter, regardless of whether an employee's  employment has terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 9, these eligibility provisions are  designed to accommodate a unique operating structure, and, therefore,  are not considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day  waiting period limitation, and the plan complies with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee G retires at age 55 after 30 years  of employment with Employer Y with no expectation of providing further  services to Employer Y. Three months later, Y recruits G to return to  work as an employee providing advice and transition assistance for G's  replacement under a one-year employment contract. Y's plan imposes a 90- day waiting period from an employee's start date before coverage becomes  effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 10, Y's plan may treat G as newly  eligible for coverage under the plan upon rehire and therefore may  impose the 90-day waiting period with respect to G for coverage offered  in connection with G's rehire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee H begins working full time for  Employer Z on October 16. Z sponsors a group health plan, under which  full time employees are eligible for coverage after they have  successfully completed a bona fide one-month orientation period. H  completes the orientation period on November 15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 11, the orientation period is not  considered a subterfuge for the passage of time and is not considered to  be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period  limitation. Accordingly, plan coverage for H must begin no later than  February 14, which is the 91st day after H completes the orientation  period. (If the orientation period was longer than one month, it would  be considered to be a subterfuge for the passage of time and designed to  avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation. Accordingly  it would violate the rules of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special rule for health insurance issuers. To the extent  coverage under a group health plan is insured by a health insurance  issuer, the issuer is permitted to rely on the eligibility information  reported to it by the employer (or other plan sponsor) and will not be  considered to violate the requirements of this section with respect to  its administration of any waiting period, if both of the following  conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The issuer requires the plan sponsor to make a representation  regarding the terms of any eligibility conditions or waiting periods  imposed by the plan sponsor before an individual is eligible to become  covered under the terms of the plan (and requires the plan sponsor to  update this representation with any changes), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The issuer has no specific knowledge of the imposition of a  waiting period that would exceed the permitted 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> No effect on other laws. Compliance with this section is not  determinative of compliance with any other provision of State or Federal  law (including ERISA, the Code, or other provisions of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act). See e.g., Sec. 146.121 of this  subchapter and Sec. 147.110, which prohibits discrimination in  eligibility for coverage based on a health factor and Code section  4980H, which generally requires applicable large employers to offer  coverage to full-time employees and their dependents or make an  assessable payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicability date. The provisions of this section apply for  plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. See Sec. 147.140  providing that the prohibition on waiting periods exceeding 90 days  applies to all group health plans and group health insurance issuers,  including grandfathered health plans.
