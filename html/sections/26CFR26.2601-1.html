                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Transfers subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions  of chapter 13 of the   Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) apply to any generation-skipping  transfer (as defined in section 2611) made after October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain transfers treated as if made after October 22, 1986.  Solely for purposes of chapter 13, an inter vivos transfer is treated as  if it were made on October 23, 1986, if it was--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to chapter 12 (regardless of whether a tax was actually  incurred or paid); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Made after September 25, 1985, but before October 23, 1986. For  purposes of this paragraph, the value of the property transferred shall  be the value of the property on the date the property was transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> do not apply in determining the  value of the property under chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principle that  paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not applicable to transfers under a  revocable trust that became irrevocable by reason of the transferor's  death after September 25, 1985, but before October 23, 1986:</p><p class="depth0">Example. T created a revocable trust on September 30, 1985, that  became irrevocable when T died on October 10, 1986. Although the trust  terminated in favor of a grandchild of T, the transfer to the grandchild  is not treated as occurring on October 23, 1986, pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2) of this section because it is not an inter vivos transfer subject  to chapter 12. The transfer is not subject to chapter 13 because it is  in the nature of a testamentary transfer that occurred prior to October  23, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> does not apply to a transfer of property  pursuant to the exercise, release, or lapse of a general power of  appointment that is treated as a taxable transfer under chapter 11 or  chapter 12. The transfer is made by the person holding the power at the  time the exercise, release, or lapse of the power becomes effective, and  is not considered a transfer under a trust that was irrevocable on  September 25, 1985. See paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section regarding  the treatment of the release, exercise, or lapse of a power of  appointment that will result in a constructive addition to a trust. See  Sec. 26.2652-1(a) for the definition of a transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Irrevocable trust defined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Unless otherwise  provided in either paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section, any  trust (as defined in section 2652(b)) in existence on September 25,  1985, is considered an irrevocable trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Property includible in the gross estate under section 2038. For  purposes of this chapter a trust is not an irrevocable trust to the  extent that, on September 25, 1985, the settlor held a power with  respect to such trust that would have caused the value of the trust to  be included in the settlor's gross estate for Federal estate tax  purposes by reason of section 2038 (without regard to powers  relinquished before September 25, 1985) if the settlor had died on  September 25, 1985. A trust is considered subject to a power on  September 25, 1985, even though the exercise of the power was subject to  the   precedent giving of notice, or even though the exercise could take  effect only on the expiration of a stated period, whether or not on or  before September 25, 1985, notice had been given or the power had been  exercised. A trust is not considered subject to a power if the power is,  by its terms, exercisable only on the occurrence of an event or  contingency not subject to the settlor's control (other than the death  of the settlor) and if the event or contingency had not in fact taken  place on September 25, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Property includible in the gross estate under section 2042. A  policy of insurance on an individual's life that is treated as a trust  under section 2652(b) is not considered an irrevocable trust to the  extent that, on September 25, 1985, the insured possessed any incident  of ownership (as defined in Sec. 20.2042-1(c) of this chapter, and  without regard to any incidents of ownership relinquished before  September 25, 1985), that would have caused the value of the trust,  (i.e., the insurance proceeds) to be included in the insured's gross  estate for Federal estate tax purposes by reason of section 2042, if the  insured had died on September 25, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Section 2038 applicable. On September 25, 1985, T, the  settlor of a trust that was created before September 25, 1985, held a  testamentary power to add new beneficiaries to the trust. T held no  other powers over any portion of the trust. The testamentary power held  by T would have caused the trust to be included in T's gross estate  under section 2038 if T had died on September 25, 1985. Therefore, the  trust is not an irrevocable trust for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Section 2038 not applicable when power held by a person  other than settlor. On September 25, 1985, S, the spouse of the settlor  of a trust in existence on that date, had an annual right to withdraw a  portion of the principal of the trust. The trust was otherwise  irrevocable on that date. Because the power was not held by the settlor  of the trust, it is not a power described in section 2038. Thus, the  trust is considered an irrevocable trust for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Section 2038 not applicable. In 1984, T created a trust  and retained the right to expand the class of remaindermen to include  any of T's afterborn grandchildren. As of September 25, 1985, all of T's  grandchildren were named remaindermen of the trust. Since the exercise  of T's power was dependent on there being afterborn grandchildren who  were not members of the class of remaindermen, a contingency that did  not exist on September 25, 1985, the trust is not considered subject to  the power on September 25, 1985, and is an irrevocable trust for  purposes of this section. The result is not changed even if  grandchildren are born after September 25, 1985, whether or not T  exercises the power to expand the class of remaindermen.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Section 2042 applicable. On September 25, 1985, T  purchased an insurance policy on T's own life and designated child, C,  and grandchild, GC, as the beneficiaries. T retained the power to obtain  from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of the policy. T's  insurance policy is a trust (as defined in section 2652(b)) for chapter  13 purposes. The trust is not considered an irrevocable trust because,  on September 25, 1985, T possessed an incident of ownership that would  have caused the value of the policy to be included in T's gross estate  under section 2042 if T had died on that date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Trust partially irrevocable. In 1984, T created a trust  naming T's grandchildren as the income and remainder beneficiaries. T  retained the power to revoke the trust as to one-half of the principal  at any time prior to T's death. T retained no other powers over the  trust principal. T did not die before September 25, 1985, and did not  exercise or release the power before that date. The half of the trust  not subject to T's power to revoke is an irrevocable trust for purposes  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trust containing qualified terminable interest property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  In general. For purposes of chapter 13, a trust described in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section that holds qualified terminable interest  property by reason of an election under section 2056(b)(7) or section  2523(f) (made either on, before or after September 25, 1985) is treated  in the same manner as if the decedent spouse or the donor spouse (as the  case may be) had made an election under section 2652(a)(3). Thus,  transfers from such trusts are not subject to chapter 13, and the  decedent spouse or the donor spouse (as the case may be) is treated as  the transferor of such property. The rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii)  does not apply to that portion of the trust that is subject to chapter  13 by reason of an addition to the trust occurring after September 25,  1985. See Sec. 26.2652-2(a) for rules where an election under section  2652(a)(3) is made. See Sec. 26.2652-2(c) for rules where a portion of  a trust   is subject to an election under section 2652(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(1)(iii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. QTIP election made after September 25, 1985. On March 28,  1985, T established a trust. The trust instrument provided that the  trustee must distribute all income annually to T's spouse, S, during S's  life. Upon S's death, the remainder is to be distributed to GC, the  grandchild of T and S. On April 15, 1986, T elected under section  2523(f) to treat the property in the trust as qualified terminable  interest property. On December 1, 1987, S died and soon thereafter the  trust assets were distributed to GC. Because the trust was irrevocable  on September 25, 1985, the transfer to GC is not subject to tax under  chapter 13. T is treated as the transferor with respect to the transfer  of the trust assets to GC in the same manner as if T had made an  election under section 2652(a)(3) to reverse the effect of the section  2523(f) election for chapter 13 purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Section 2652(a)(3) election deemed to have been made.  Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except the trust instrument  provides that after S's death all income is to be paid annually to C,  the child of T and S. Upon C's death, the remainder is to be distributed  to GC. C died on October 1, 1992, and soon thereafter the trust assets  are distributed to GC. Because the trust was irrevocable on September  25, 1985, the termination of C's interest is not subject to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> requires separate portions of one trust only for  purposes of determining inclusion ratios. For purposes of chapter 13, a  constructive addition under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section is  treated as an addition. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for  exceptions to the additions rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(iv). See Sec.  26.2654-1(a)(2) for rules treating additions to a trust by an individual  other than the initial transferor as a separate trust for purposes of  chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Terminations of interests in and distributions from trusts.  Where a termination or distribution described in section 2612 occurs  with respect to a trust to which an addition has been made, the portion  of such termination or distribution allocable to the chapter 13 portion  is determined by reference to the allocation fraction, as defined in  paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section. In the case of a termination  described in section 2612(a) with respect to a trust, the portion of  such termination that is subject to chapter 13 is the product of the  allocation fraction and the value of the trust (to the extent of the  terminated interest therein). In the case of a distribution described in  section 2612(b) from a trust, the portion of such distribution that is  subject to chapter 13 is the product of the allocation fraction and the  value of the property distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, the   total value of the entire trust is the fair market value of the property  held in trust (determined under the rules of section 2031), reduced by  any amount attributable to or paid by the trust and attributable to the  transfer to the trust that is similar to an amount that would be  allowable as a deduction under section 2053 if the addition had occurred  at the death of the transferor, and further reduced by the same amount  that the numerator was reduced to reflect Federal or state estate or  gift tax incurred by and subsequently paid by the recipient trust with  respect to the addition. Where there is more than one addition to  principal after September 25, 1985, the portion of the trust subject to  chapter 13 after each such addition is determined pursuant to a revised  fraction. In each case, the numerator of the revised fraction is the sum  of the value of the chapter 13 portion of the trust immediately before  the latest addition, and the amount of the latest addition. The  denominator of the revised fraction is the total value of the entire  trust immediately after the addition. If the transfer to the trust is a  generation-skipping transfer, the numerator and denominator are reduced  by the amount of the generation-skipping transfer tax, if any, that is  imposed by chapter 13 on the transfer and actually recovered from the  trust. The allocation fraction is rounded off to five decimal places  (.00001).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. In each of the examples, assume  that the recipient trust does not pay any Federal or state transfer tax  by reason of the addition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On August  16, 1980, T established an irrevocable trust. Under the trust  instrument, the trustee is required to distribute the entire income  annually to T's child, C, for life, then to T's grandchild, GC, for  life. Upon GC's death, the remainder is to be paid to GC's issue. On  October 1, 1986, when the total value of the entire trust is $400,000, T  transfers $100,000 to the trust. The allocation fraction is computed as  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27DE95.002</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thus, immediately after the transfer, 20 percent of the value  of future generation-skipping transfers under the trust will be subject  to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Effect of expenses. Assume the same facts as in Example  1, except immediately prior to the transfer on October 1, 1986, the fair  market value of the individual assets in the trust totaled $400,000.  Also, assume that the trust had accrued and unpaid debts, expenses, and  taxes totaling $300,000. Assume further that the entire $300,000  represented amounts that would be deductible under section 2053 if the  trust were includible in the transferor's gross estate. The numerator of  the allocation fraction is $100,000 and the denominator of the  allocation fraction is $200,000 (($400,000-$300,000)+$100,000). Thus,  the allocation fraction is .5 ($100,000/$200,000) and 50 percent of the  value of future generation-skipping transfers will be subject to chapter  13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in  Example 1, except on January 30, 1988, when the total value of the  entire trust is $600,000, T transfers an additional $40,000 to the  trust. Before the transfer, the value of the portion of the trust that  was attributable to the prior addition was $120,000 ($600,000x.2). The  new allocation fraction is computed as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27DE95.003</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thus, immediately after the transfer, 25 percent of the value  of future generation-skipping transfers under the trust will be subject  to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Allocation fraction at time of generation-skipping  transfer. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except on March 1,  1989, when the value of the trust is $800,000, C dies. A generation- skipping transfer occurs at C's death because of the termination of C's  life estate. Therefore, $200,000 ($800,000x.25) is subject to tax under  chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Constructive additions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Powers of Appointment. Except as  provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section, where any portion of  a trust remains in the trust after the post-September 25, 1985, release,  exercise, or lapse of a power of appointment over that portion of the  trust, and the release, exercise, or lapse is treated to any extent as a  taxable transfer under chapter 11 or chapter 12, the value of the entire  portion of the trust subject to the power that was released, exercised,  or lapsed is treated as if that portion had been withdrawn and  immediately retransferred to the trust at the time of the release,  exercise, or lapse. The creator of the power will be considered the  transferor of the addition except to the extent that the release,  exercise, or lapse of the power is treated as a taxable transfer under  chapter 11 or chapter 12. See Sec. 26.2652-1 for rules for determining  the identity of the transferor of property for purposes of chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for certain powers of appointment. The release,  exercise, or lapse of a power of appointment (other than a general power  of appointment as defined in section 2041(b)) is not treated as an  addition to a trust if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the exercise of a power of appointment that validly  postpones or suspends the vesting, absolute ownership or power of  alienation of an interest in property for a term of years that will not  exceed 90 years (measured from the date of creation of the trust) will  not be considered an exercise that postpones or suspends vesting,  absolute ownership or the power of alienation beyond the perpetuities  period. If a power is exercised by creating another power, it is deemed  to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Constructive addition if liability is not paid out of trust  principal. Where a trust described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section  is relieved of any liability properly payable out of the assets of such  trust, the person or entity who actually satisfies the liability is  considered to have made a constructive addition to the trust in an  amount equal to the liability. The constructive addition occurs when the  trust is relieved of liability (e.g., when the right of recovery is no  longer enforceable). But see Sec. 26.2652-1(a)(3) for rules involving  the application of section 2207A in the case of an election under  section 2652(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(1)(v):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Lapse of a power of appointment. On June 19, 1980, T  established an irrevocable trust with a corpus of $500,000. The trust  instrument provides that the trustee shall distribute the entire income  from the trust annually to T's spouse, S, during S's life. At S's death,  the remainder is to be distributed to T and S's grandchild, GC. T also  gave S a general power of appointment over one-half of the trust assets.  On December 21, 1989, when the value of the trust corpus is $1,500,000,  S died without having exercised the general power of appointment. The  value of one-half of the trust corpus, $750,000 ($1,500,000 x .5) is  included in S's gross estate under section 2041(a) and is subject to tax  under Chapter 11. Because the value of one-half of the trust corpus is  subject to tax under Chapter 11 with respect to S's estate, S is treated  as the transferor of that property for purposes of Chapter 13 (see  section 2652(a)(1)(A)). For purposes of the generation-skipping transfer  tax, the lapse of S's power of appointment is treated as if $750,000  ($1,500,000 x .5) had been distributed to S and then transferred back to  the trust. Thus, S is considered to have added $750,000 ($1,500,000 x  .5) to the trust at the date of S's death. Because this constructive  addition occurred after September 25, 1985, 50 percent of the corpus of  the trust became subject to Chapter 13 at S's death.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Multiple actual additions. On June 19, 1980, T  established an irrevocable trust with a principal of $500,000. The trust  instrument provides that the trustee shall distribute the entire income  from the trust annually to T's spouse, S, during S's life. At S's death,  the remainder is to be distributed to GC, the grandchild of T and S. On  October 1, 1985, when the trust assets were valued at $800,000, T added  $200,000 to the trust. After the transfer on October 1, 1985, the  allocation fraction was .2 ($200,000/$1,000,000). On December 21, 1989,  when the value of the trust principal is $1,000,000, T adds $1,000,000  to the trust. After this addition, the new allocation fraction is 0.6  ($1,200,000/$2,000,000). The numerator of the fraction is the value of  that portion of trust assets that were subject to chapter 13 immediately  prior to the addition (by reason of the first addition), $200,000 (.2 x  $1,000,000), plus the value of the second transfer, $1,000,000, which  equals $1,200,000. The denominator of the fraction, $2,000,000, is the  total value of the trust assets immediately after the second transfer.  Thus, 60 percent of the principal of the trust becomes subject to  chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Entire portion of trust subject to lapsed power is  treated as an addition. On September 25, 1985, B possessed a general  power of appointment over the assets of an irrevocable trust that had  been created by T in 1980. Under the terms of the trust, B's power  lapsed on July 20, 1987. For Federal gift tax purposes, B is treated as  making a gift of ninety-five percent (100%--5%) of the value of the  principal (see section 2514). However, because the entire trust was  subject to the power of appointment, 100 percent (that portion of the  trust subject to the power) of the assets of the trust are treated as a  constructive addition. Thus, the entire amount of all generation- skipping transfers occurring pursuant to the trust instrument after July  20, 1987, are subject to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Exercise of power of appointment in favor of another  trust. On March 1, 1985, T established an irrevocable trust as defined  in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the terms of the trust  instrument, the trustee is required to distribute the entire income  annually to T's child, C, for life, then to T's grandchild, GC, for  life. GC has the power to appoint any or all of the trust assets to  Trust 2 which is an irrevocable trust (as defined in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section) that was established on August 1, 1985. The  terms of Trust 2's governing instrument provide that the trustee shall  pay income to T's great grandchild, GGC, for life. Upon GGC's death, the  remainder is to be paid to GGC's issue. GGC was alive on March 1, 1985,  when Trust 1 was created. C died on April 1, 1986. On July 1, 1987, GC  exercised the power of appointment. The exercise of GC's power does not  subject future transfers from Trust 2 to tax under chapter 13 because  the exercise of the power in favor of Trust 2 does not suspend the  vesting, absolute ownership, or power of alienation of an interest in  property for a period, measured from the date of creation of Trust 1,  extending beyond the life of GGC (a beneficiary under Trust 2 who was in  being at the date of creation of Trust 1) plus a period of 21 years. The  result would be the same if Trust 2 had been created after the effective  date of chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Exercise of power of appointment in favor of another  trust. Assume the same facts as in Example 4, except that GGC was born  on March 28, 1986. The valid exercise of GC's power in favor of Trust 2  causes the principal of Trust 1 to be subject to chapter 13, because GGC  was not born until after the creation of Trust 1. Thus, such exercise  may suspend the vesting, absolute ownership, or power of alienation of  an interest in the trust principal for a period, measured from the date  of creation of Trust 1, extending beyond the life of GGC (a beneficiary  under Trust 2 who was not a life in being at the date of creation of  Trust 1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Extension for the longer of two periods. Prior to the  effective date of chapter 13, GP established an irrevocable trust under  which the trust income was to be paid to GP's child, C, for life. C was  given a testamentary power to appoint the remainder in further trust for  the benefit of C's issue. In default of C's exercise of the power, the  remainder was to pass to charity. C died on February 3, 1995, survived  by a child who was alive when GP established the trust. C exercised the  power in a manner that validly extends the trust in favor of C's issue  until the latter of May 15, 2064 (80 years from the date the trust was  created), or the death of C's child plus 21 years. C's exercise of the  power is a constructive addition to the trust because the exercise may  extend the trust for a period longer than the permissible periods of  either the life of C's child (a life in being at the creation of the  trust) plus 21 years or a term not more than 90 years measured from the  creation of the trust. On the other hand, if C's exercise of the power  could extend the trust based only on the life of C's child plus 21 years  or only for a term of 80 years from the creation of the trust (but not  the later of the two periods) then the exercise of the power would not  have been a constructive addition to the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Extension for the longer of two periods. The facts are  the same as in Example 6 except local law provides that the effect of  C's exercise is to extend the term of the trust until May 15, 2064,  whether or not C's child predeceases that date by more than 21 years.  C's exercise is not a constructive addition to the trust because C  exercised the power in a manner that cannot postpone or suspend vesting,  absolute ownership, or power of alienation for a term of years that will  exceed 90 years. The result would be the   same if the effect of C's exercise is either to extend the term of the  trust until 21 years after the death of C's child or to extend the term  of the trust until the first to occur of May 15, 2064 or 21 years after  the death of C's child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Appreciation and income. Except to the extent that the  provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section allocate  subsequent appreciation and accumulated income between the original  trust and additions thereto, appreciation in the value of the trust and  undistributed income added thereto are not considered an addition to the  principal of a trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule for wills or revocable trusts executed before  October 22, 1986--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The provisions of chapter 13 do not  apply to any generation-skipping transfer under a will or revocable  trust executed before October 22, 1986, provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The document in existence on October 21, 1986, is not amended at  any time after October 21, 1986, in any respect which results in the  creation of, or an increase in the amount of, a generation-skipping  transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a revocable trust, no addition is made to the  revocable trust after October 21, 1986, that results in the creation of,  or an increase in the amount of, a generation-skipping transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The decedent dies before January 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revocable trust defined. For purposes of this section, the term  revocable trust means any trust (as defined in section 2652(b)) except  to the extent that, on October 22, 1986, the trust--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Was an irrevocable trust described in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Would have been an irrevocable trust described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section had it not been created or become irrevocable  after September 25, 1985, and before October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this  section apply to any will or revocable trust within the scope of the  transition rule of this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amendments to will or revocable trust. For purposes of this  paragraph (b)(2), an amendment to a will or a revocable trust in  existence on October 21, 1986, is not considered to result in the  creation of, or an increase in the amount of, a generation-skipping  transfer where the amendment is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Basically administrative or clarifying in nature and only  incidentally increases the amount transferred; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Designed to ensure that an existing bequest or transfer  qualifies for the applicable marital or charitable deduction for estate,  gift, or generation-skipping transfer tax purposes and only incidentally  increases the amount transferred to a skip person or to a generation- skipping trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Creation of, or increase in the amount of, a GST. In determining  whether a particular amendment to a will or revocable trust creates, or  increases the amount of, a generation-skipping transfer for purposes of  this paragraph (b)(2), the effect of the instrument(s) in existence on  October 21, 1986, is measured against the effect of the instrument(s) in  existence on the date of death of the decedent or on the date of any  prior generation-skipping transfer. If the effect of an amendment cannot  be immediately determined, it is deemed to create, or increase the  amount of, a generation-skipping transfer until a determination can be  made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additions to revocable trusts. Any addition made after October  21, 1986, but before the death of the settlor, to a revocable trust  subjects all subsequent generation-skipping transfers under the trust to  the provisions of chapter 13. Any addition made to a revocable trust  after the death of the settlor (if the settlor dies before January 1,  1987) is treated as an addition to an irrevocable trust. See paragraph  (b)(1)(v) of this section for rules involving constructive additions to  trusts. See paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section for rules providing  that certain transfers to trusts are not treated as additions for  purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facts applicable to Examples 1 through 5. In each of Examples 1  through 5 assume that T executed a   will prior to October 22, 1986, and that T dies on December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Administrative change. On November 1, 1986, T executes a  codicil to T's will removing one of the co-executors named in the will.  Although the codicil may have the effect of lowering administrative  costs and thus increasing the amount transferred, it is considered  administrative in nature and thus does not cause generation-skipping  transfers under the will to be subject to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Effect of amendment not immediately determinable. On  November 1, 1986, T executes a codicil to T's will revoking a bequest of  $100,000 to C, a non-skip person (as defined under section 2613(b)) and  causing that amount to be added to a residuary trust held for a skip  person. The amendment is deemed to increase the amount of a generation- skipping transfer and prevents any transfers under the will from  qualifying under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. If, however, C  dies before T and under local law the property would have been added to  the residue in any event because the bequest would have lapsed, the  codicil is not considered an amendment that increases the amount of a  generation-skipping transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Refund of tax paid because of amendment. T's will  provided that an amount equal to the maximum allowable marital deduction  would pass to T's spouse with the residue of the estate passing to a  trust established for the benefit of skip persons. On October 23, 1986,  the will is amended to provide that the marital share passing to T's  spouse shall be the lesser of the maximum allowable marital deduction or  the minimum amount that will result in no estate tax liability for T's  estate. The amendment may increase the amount of a generation-skipping  transfer. Therefore, any generation-skipping transfers under the will  are subject to tax under chapter 13. If it becomes apparent that the  amendment does not increase the amount of a generation-skipping  transfer, a claim for refund may be filed with respect to any  generation-skipping transfer tax that was paid within the period set  forth in section 6511. For example, it would become apparent that the  amendment did not result in an increase in the residue if it is  subsequently determined that the maximum marital deduction and the  minimum amount that will result in no estate tax liability are equal in  amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. An amendment that increases a generation-skipping  transfer causes complete loss of exempt status. T's will provided for  the creation of two trusts for the benefit of skip persons. On November  1, 1986, T executed a codicil to the will specifically increasing the  amount of a generation-skipping transfer under the will. All transfers  made pursuant to the will or either of the trusts created thereunder are  precluded from qualifying under the transition rule of paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section and are subject to tax under chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Corrective action effective. Assume that T in Example 4  later executes a second codicil deleting the increase to the generation- skipping transfer. Because the provision increasing a generation- skipping transfer does not become effective, it is not considered an  amendment to a will in existence on October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Facts applicable to Examples 6 through 8. T created a trust on  September 30, 1985, in which T retained the power to revoke the transfer  at any time prior to T's death. The trust provided that, upon the death  of T, the income was to be paid to T's spouse, W, for life and then to  A, B, and C, the children of T's sibling, S, in equal shares for life,  with one-third of the principal to be distributed per stirpes to each  child's surviving issue upon the death of the child. The trustee has the  power to make discretionary distributions of trust principal to T's  sibling, S.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Amendment that affects only a person who is not a skip  person. A became disabled, and T modified the trust on December 1, 1986,  to increase A's share of the income. Since the amendment does not result  in the creation of, or increase in the amount of, a generation-skipping  transfer, transfers pursuant to the trust are not subject to chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Amendment that adds a skip person. Assume that T amends  the trust to add T's grandchild, D, as an income beneficiary. The trust  will be subject to the provisions of chapter 13 because the amendment  creates a generation-skipping transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Refund of tax paid during interim period when effect of  amendment is not determinable. Assume that T amends the trust to provide  that the issue of S are to take a one-fourth share of the principal per  stirpes upon S's death. Because the distribution to be made upon S's  death may involve skip persons, the amendment is considered an amendment  that creates or increases the amount of a generation-skipping transfer  until a determination can be made. Accordingly, any distributions from  (or terminations of interests in) such trust are subject to chapter 13  until it is determined that no skip person has been added to the trust.  At that time, a claim for refund may be filed within the period set  forth in section 6511 with respect to any generation-skipping transfer  tax that was paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition rule in the case of mental incompetency--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If an individual was under a mental disability to change the  disposition of his or her property continuously from October 22, 1986,  until the date of his or her death, the provisions of chapter 13 do not  apply to any generation-skipping transfer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under a trust (as defined in section 2652(b)) to the extent such  trust consists of property, or the proceeds of property, the value of  which was included in the gross estate of the individual (other than  property transferred by or on behalf of the individual during the  individual's life after October 22, 1986); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Which is a direct skip (other than a direct skip from a trust)  that occurs by reason of the death of the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mental disability defined. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(2), the term mental disability means mental incompetence to execute  an instrument governing the disposition of the individual's property,  whether or not there was an adjudication of incompetence and regardless  of whether there has been an appointment of a guardian, fiduciary, or  other person charged with either the care of the individual or the care  of the individual's property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Decedent who has not been adjudged mentally incompetent. If  there has not been a court adjudication that the decedent was mentally  incompetent on or before October 22, 1986, the executor must file, with  Form 706, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A certification from a qualified physician stating that the  decedent was--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mentally incompetent at all times on and after October 22, 1986;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Did not regain competence to modify or revoke the terms of the  trust or will prior to his or her death; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sufficient other evidence demonstrating that the decedent was  mentally incompetent at all times on and after October 22, 1986, as well  as a statement explaining why no certification is available from a  physician; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any judgement or decree relating to the decedent's incompetency  that was made after October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such items in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(1), (2), and (3) of this  section will be considered relevant, but not determinative, in  establishing the decedent's state of competency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Decedent who has been adjudged mentally incompetent. If the  decedent has been adjudged mentally incompetent on or before October 22,  1986, a copy of the judgment or decree, and any modification thereof,  must be filed with the Form 706.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Rule applies even if another person has power to change trust  terms. In the case of a transfer from a trust, this paragraph (b)(3)  applies even though a person charged with the care of the decedent or  the decedent's property has the power to revoke or modify the terms of  the trust, provided that the power is not exercised after October 22,  1986, in a manner that creates, or increases the amount of, a  generation-skipping transfer. See paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section  for rules concerning amendments that create or increase the amount of a  generation-skipping transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. T was mentally incompetent on October 22, 1986, and  remained so until death in 1993. Prior to becoming incompetent, T  created a revocable generation-skipping trust that was includible in T's  gross estate. Prior to October 22, 1986, the appropriate court issued an  order under which P, who was thereby charged with the care of T's  property, had the power to modify or revoke the revocable trust.  Although P exercised the power after October 22, 1986, and while T was  incompetent, the power was not exercised in a manner that created, or  increased the amount of, a generation-skipping transfer. Thus, the  existence and exercise of P's power did not cause the trust to lose its  exempt status under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The result would  be the same if the court order was issued after October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Retention of trust's exempt status in the case of modifications,  etc.--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (b)(4) provides rules for  determining when a modification, judicial construction, settlement  agreement, or trustee action with respect to a trust that is exempt from  the generation-skipping transfer tax under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3)  of this section (hereinafter referred to as an   exempt trust) will not cause the trust to lose its exempt status. In  general, unless specifically provided otherwise, the rules contained in  this paragraph are applicable only for purposes of determining whether  an exempt trust retains its exempt status for generation-skipping  transfer tax purposes. Thus (unless specifically noted), the rules do  not apply in determining, for example, whether the transaction results  in a gift subject to gift tax, or may cause the trust to be included in  the gross estate of a beneficiary, or may result in the realization of  gain for purposes of section 1001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Discretionary powers. The distribution of trust principal from  an exempt trust to a new trust or retention of trust principal in a  continuing trust will not cause the new or continuing trust to be  subject to the provisions of chapter 13, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The terms of the governing instrument of the exempt trust  authorize distributions to the new trust or the retention of trust  principal in a continuing trust, without the consent or approval of any  beneficiary or court; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time the exempt trust became irrevocable, state law  authorized distributions to the new trust or retention of principal in  the continuing trust, without the consent or approval of any beneficiary  or court; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The terms of the governing instrument of the new or continuing  trust do not extend the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in  the trust in a manner that may postpone or suspend the vesting, absolute  ownership, or power of alienation of an interest in property for a  period, measured from the date the original trust became irrevocable,  extending beyond any life in being at the date the original trust became  irrevocable plus a period of 21 years, plus if necessary, a reasonable  period of gestation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A), the  exercise of a trustee's distributive power that validly postpones or  suspends the vesting, absolute ownership, or power of alienation of an  interest in property for a term of years that will not exceed 90 years  (measured from the date the original trust became irrevocable) will not  be considered an exercise that postpones or suspends vesting, absolute  ownership, or the power of alienation beyond the perpetuities period. If  a distributive power is exercised by creating another power, it is  deemed to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be  exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Settlement. A court-approved settlement of a bona fide issue  regarding the administration of the trust or the construction of terms  of the governing instrument will not cause an exempt trust to be subject  to the provisions of chapter 13, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The settlement is the product of arm's length negotiations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The settlement is within the range of reasonable outcomes under  the governing instrument and applicable state law addressing the issues  resolved by the settlement. A settlement that results in a compromise  between the positions of the litigating parties and reflects the  parties' assessments of the relative strengths of their positions is a  settlement that is within the range of reasonable outcomes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Judicial construction. A judicial construction of a governing  instrument to resolve an ambiguity in the terms of the instrument or to  correct a scrivener's error will not cause an exempt trust to be subject  to the provisions of chapter 13, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The judicial action involves a bona fide issue; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The construction is consistent with applicable state law that  would be applied by the highest court of the state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other changes. (1) A modification of the governing instrument of  an exempt trust (including a trustee distribution, settlement, or  construction that does not satisfy paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C)  of this section) by judicial reformation, or nonjudicial reformation  that is valid under applicable state law, will not cause an exempt trust  to be subject to the provisions of chapter 13, if the modification does  not shift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary who  occupies a lower generation (as defined in section 2651) than the person  or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the modification,  and the modification does not extend the time for vesting of any  beneficial interest in the   trust beyond the period provided for in the original trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, a modification of an exempt trust  will result in a shift in beneficial interest to a lower generation  beneficiary if the modification can result in either an increase in the  amount of a GST transfer or the creation of a new GST transfer. To  determine whether a modification of an irrevocable trust will shift a  beneficial interest in a trust to a beneficiary who occupies a lower  generation, the effect of the instrument on the date of the modification  is measured against the effect of the instrument in existence  immediately before the modification. If the effect of the modification  cannot be immediately determined, it is deemed to shift a beneficial  interest in the trust to a beneficiary who occupies a lower generation  (as defined in section 2651) than the person or persons who held the  beneficial interest prior to the modification. A modification that is  administrative in nature that only indirectly increases the amount  transferred (for example, by lowering administrative costs or income  taxes) will not be considered to shift a beneficial interest in the  trust. In addition, administration of a trust in conformance with  applicable local law that defines the term income as a unitrust amount  (or permits a right to income to be satisfied by such an amount) or that  permits the trustee to adjust between principal and income to fulfill  the trustee's duty of impartiality between income and principal  beneficiaries will not be considered to shift a beneficial interest in  the trust, if applicable local law provides for a reasonable  apportionment between the income and remainder beneficiaries of the  total return of the trust and meets the requirements of Sec. 1.643(b)-1  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(4). In each example, assume that the trust  established in 1980 was irrevocable for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)  of this section and that there have been no additions to any trust after  September 25, 1985. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Trustee's power to distribute principal authorized under  trust instrument. In 1980, Grantor established an irrevocable trust  (Trust) for the benefit of Grantor's child, A, A's spouse, and A's  issue. At the time Trust was established, A had two children, B and C. A  corporate fiduciary was designated as trustee. Under the terms of Trust,  the trustee has the discretion to distribute all or part of the trust  income to one or more of the group consisting of A, A's spouse or A's  issue. The trustee is also authorized to distribute all or part of the  trust principal to one or more trusts for the benefit of A, A's spouse,  or A's issue under terms specified by the trustee in the trustee's  discretion. Any trust established under Trust, however, must terminate  21 years after the death of the last child of A to die who was alive at  the time Trust was executed. Trust will terminate on the death of A, at  which time the remaining principal will be distributed to A's issue, per  stirpes. In 2002, the trustee distributes part of Trust's principal to a  new trust for the benefit of B and C and their issue. The new trust will  terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of B and C, at which  time the trust principal will be distributed to the issue of B and C,  per stirpes. The terms of the governing instrument of Trust authorize  the trustee to make the distribution to a new trust without the consent  or approval of any beneficiary or court. In addition, the terms of the  governing instrument of the new trust do not extend the time for vesting  of any beneficial interest in a manner that may postpone or suspend the  vesting, absolute ownership or power of alienation of an interest in  property for a period, measured from the date of creation of Trust,  extending beyond any life in being at the date of creation of Trust plus  a period of 21 years, plus if necessary, a reasonable period of  gestation. Therefore, neither Trust nor the new trust will be subject to  the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Trustee's power to distribute principal pursuant to state  statute. In 1980, Grantor established an irrevocable trust (Trust) for  the benefit of Grantor's child, A, A's spouse, and A's issue. At the  time Trust was established, A had two children, B and C. A corporate  fiduciary was designated as trustee. Under the terms of Trust, the  trustee has the discretion to distribute all or part of the trust income  or principal to one or more of the group consisting of A, A's spouse or  A's issue. Trust will terminate on the death of A, at which time, the  trust principal will be distributed to A's issue, per stirpes. Under a  state statute enacted after 1980 that is applicable to Trust, a trustee  who has the absolute discretion under the terms of a testamentary  instrument or irrevocable inter vivos trust agreement to invade the  principal of a trust for the benefit of the income beneficiaries of the  trust, may exercise the discretion by appointing so much or all of   the principal of the trust in favor of a trustee of a trust under an  instrument other than that under which the power to invade is created,  or under the same instrument. The trustee may take the action either  with consent of all the persons interested in the trust but without  prior court approval, or with court approval, upon notice to all of the  parties. The exercise of the discretion, however, must not reduce any  fixed income interest of any income beneficiary of the trust and must be  in favor of the beneficiaries of the trust. Under state law prior to the  enactment of the state statute, the trustee did not have the authority  to make distributions in trust. In 2002, the trustee distributes one- half of Trust's principal to a new trust that provides for the payment  of trust income to A for life and further provides that, at A's death,  one-half of the trust remainder will pass to B or B's issue and one-half  of the trust will pass to C or C's issue. Because the state statute was  enacted after Trust was created and requires the consent of all of the  parties, the transaction constitutes a modification of Trust. However,  the modification does not shift any beneficial interest in Trust to a  beneficiary or beneficiaries who occupy a lower generation than the  person or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the  modification. In addition, the modification does not extend the time for  vesting of any beneficial interest in Trust beyond the period provided  for in the original trust. The new trust will terminate at the same date  provided under Trust. Therefore, neither Trust nor the new trust will be  subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Construction of an ambiguous term in the instrument. In  1980, Grantor established an irrevocable trust for the benefit of  Grantor's children, A and B, and their issue. The trust is to terminate  on the death of the last to die of A and B, at which time the principal  is to be distributed to their issue. However, the provision governing  the termination of the trust is ambiguous regarding whether the trust  principal is to be distributed per stirpes, only to the children of A  and B, or per capita among the children, grandchildren, and more remote  issue of A and B. In 2002, the trustee files a construction suit with  the appropriate local court to resolve the ambiguity. The court issues  an order construing the instrument to provide for per capita  distributions to the children, grandchildren, and more remote issue of A  and B living at the time the trust terminates. The court's construction  resolves a bona fide issue regarding the proper interpretation of the  instrument and is consistent with applicable state law as it would be  interpreted by the highest court of the state. Therefore, the trust will  not be subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue  Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Change in trust situs. In 1980, Grantor, who was  domiciled in State X, executed an irrevocable trust for the benefit of  Grantor's issue, naming a State X bank as trustee. Under the terms of  the trust, the trust is to terminate, in all events, no later than 21  years after the death of the last to die of certain designated  individuals living at the time the trust was executed. The provisions of  the trust do not specify that any particular state law is to govern the  administration and construction of the trust. In State X, the common law  rule against perpetuities applies to trusts. In 2002, a State Y bank is  named as sole trustee. The effect of changing trustees is that the situs  of the trust changes to State Y, and the laws of State Y govern the  administration and construction of the trust. State Y law contains no  rule against perpetuities. In this case, however, in view of the terms  of the trust instrument, the trust will terminate at the same time  before and after the change in situs. Accordingly, the change in situs  does not shift any beneficial interest in the trust to a beneficiary who  occupies a lower generation (as defined in section 2651) than the person  or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the transfer.  Furthermore, the change in situs does not extend the time for vesting of  any beneficial interest in the trust beyond that provided for in the  original trust. Therefore, the trust will not be subject to the  provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. If, in this  example, as a result of the change in situs, State Y law governed such  that the time for vesting was extended beyond the period prescribed  under the terms of the original trust instrument, the trust would not  retain exempt status.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Division of a trust. In 1980, Grantor established an  irrevocable trust for the benefit of his two children, A and B, and  their issue. Under the terms of the trust, the trustee has the  discretion to distribute income and principal to A, B, and their issue  in such amounts as the trustee deems appropriate. On the death of the  last to die of A and B, the trust principal is to be distributed to the  living issue of A and B, per stirpes. In 2002, the appropriate local  court approved the division of the trust into two equal trusts, one for  the benefit of A and A's issue and one for the benefit of B and B's  issue. The trust for A and A's issue provides that the trustee has the  discretion to distribute trust income and principal to A and A's issue  in such amounts as the trustee deems appropriate. On A's death, the  trust principal is to be distributed equally to A's issue, per stirpes.  If A dies with no living descendants, the principal will be added to the  trust for B and B's issue. The trust for B and B's issue is identical  (except for the beneficiaries), and terminates at B's death at which  time the trust principal is to be distributed equally to B's issue, per  stirpes. If B dies with no living   descendants, principal will be added to the trust for A and A's issue.  The division of the trust into two trusts does not shift any beneficial  interest in the trust to a beneficiary who occupies a lower generation  (as defined in section 2651) than the person or persons who held the  beneficial interest prior to the division. In addition, the division  does not extend the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the  trust beyond the period provided for in the original trust. Therefore,  the two partitioned trusts resulting from the division will not be  subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Merger of two trusts. In 1980, Grantor established an  irrevocable trust for Grantor's child and the child's issue. In 1983,  Grantor's spouse also established a separate irrevocable trust for the  benefit of the same child and issue. The terms of the spouse's trust and  Grantor's trust are identical. In 2002, the appropriate local court  approved the merger of the two trusts into one trust to save  administrative costs and enhance the management of the investments. The  merger of the two trusts does not shift any beneficial interest in the  trust to a beneficiary who occupies a lower generation (as defined in  section 2651) than the person or persons who held the beneficial  interest prior to the merger. In addition, the merger does not extend  the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the  period provided for in the original trust. Therefore, the trust that  resulted from the merger will not be subject to the provisions of  chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Modification that does not shift an interest to a lower  generation. In 1980, Grantor established an irrevocable trust for the  benefit of Grantor's grandchildren, A, B, and C. The trust provides that  income is to be paid to A, B, and C, in equal shares for life. The trust  further provides that, upon the death of the first grandchild to die,  one-third of the principal is to be distributed to that grandchild's  issue, per stirpes. Upon the death of the second grandchild to die, one- half of the remaining trust principal is to be distributed to that  grandchild's issue, per stirpes, and upon the death of the last  grandchild to die, the remaining principal is to be distributed to that  grandchild's issue, per stirpes. In 2002, A became disabled.  Subsequently, the trustee, with the consent of B and C, petitioned the  appropriate local court and the court approved a modification of the  trust that increased A's share of trust income. The modification does  not shift a beneficial interest to a lower generation beneficiary  because the modification does not increase the amount of a GST transfer  under the original trust or create the possibility that new GST  transfers not contemplated in the original trust may be made. In this  case, the modification will increase the amount payable to A who is a  member of the same generation as B and C. In addition, the modification  does not extend the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the  trust beyond the period provided for in the original trust. Therefore,  the trust as modified will not be subject to the provisions of chapter  13 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the modification increasing  A's share of trust income is a transfer by B and C to A for Federal gift  tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Conversion of income interest into unitrust interest. In  1980, Grantor established an irrevocable trust under the terms of which  trust income is payable to A for life and, upon A's death, the remainder  is to pass to A's issue, per stirpes. In 2002, the appropriate local  court approves a modification to the trust that converts A's income  interest into the right to receive the greater of the entire income of  the trust or a fixed percentage of the trust assets valued annually  (unitrust interest) to be paid each year to A for life. The modification  does not result in a shift in beneficial interest to a beneficiary who  occupies a lower generation (as defined in section 2651) than the person  or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the modification.  In this case, the modification can only operate to increase the amount  distributable to A and decrease the amount distributable to A's issue.  In addition, the modification does not extend the time for vesting of  any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in  the original trust. Therefore, the trust will not be subject to the  provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Allocation of capital gain to income. In 1980, Grantor  established an irrevocable trust under the terms of which trust income  is payable to Grantor's child, A, for life, and upon A's death, the  remainder is to pass to A's issue, per stirpes. Under applicable state  law, unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, capital gain is  allocated to principal. In 2002, the trust is modified to allow the  trustee to allocate capital gain to the income. The modification does  not shift any beneficial interest in the trust to a beneficiary who  occupies a lower generation (as defined in section 2651) than the person  or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the modification.  In this case, the modification can only have the effect of increasing  the amount distributable to A, and decreasing the amount distributable  to A's issue. In addition, the modification does not extend the time for  vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period  provided for in the original trust. Therefore, the trust will not be  subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Administrative change to terms of a trust. In 1980,  Grantor executed an irrevocable trust for the benefit of Grantor's   issue, naming a bank and five other individuals as trustees. In 2002,  the appropriate local court approves a modification of the trust that  decreases the number of trustees which results in lower administrative  costs. The modification pertains to the administration of the trust and  does not shift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary who  occupies a lower generation (as defined in section 2651) than the person  or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the modification.  In addition, the modification does not extend the time for vesting of  any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in  the original trust. Therefore, the trust will not be subject to the  provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Conversion of income interest to unitrust interest under  state statute. In 1980, Grantor, a resident of State X, established an  irrevocable trust for the benefit of Grantor's child, A, and A's issue.  The trust provides that trust income is payable to A for life and upon  A's death the remainder is to pass to A's issue, per stirpes. In 2002,  State X amends its income and principal statute to define income as a  unitrust amount of 4% of the fair market value of the trust assets  valued annually. For a trust established prior to 2002, the statute  provides that the new definition of income will apply only if all the  beneficiaries who have an interest in the trust consent to the change  within two years after the effective date of the statute. The statute  provides specific procedures to establish the consent of the  beneficiaries. A and A's issue consent to the change in the definition  of income within the time period, and in accordance with the procedures,  prescribed by the state statute. The administration of the trust, in  accordance with the state statute defining income to be a 4% unitrust  amount, will not be considered to shift any beneficial interest in the  trust. Therefore, the trust will not be subject to the provisions of  chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, under these facts, no  trust beneficiary will be treated as having made a gift for federal gift  tax purposes, and neither the trust nor any trust beneficiary will be  treated as having made a taxable exchange for federal income tax  purposes. Similarly, the conclusions in this example would be the same  if the beneficiaries' consent was not required, or, if the change in  administration of the trust occurred because the situs of the trust was  changed to State X from a state whose statute does not define income as  a unitrust amount or if the situs was changed to such a state from State  X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Equitable adjustments under state statute. The facts are  the same as in Example 11, except that in 2002, State X amends its  income and principal statute to permit the trustee to make adjustments  between income and principal when the trustee invests and manages the  trust assets under the state's prudent investor standard, the trust  describes the amount that shall or must be distributed to a beneficiary  by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee after applying the  state statutory rules regarding allocation of receipts between income  and principal is unable to administer the trust impartially. The  provision permitting the trustees to make these adjustments is effective  in 2002 for trusts created at any time. The trustee invests and manages  the trust assets under the state's prudent investor standard, and  pursuant to authorization in the state statute, the trustee allocates  receipts between the income and principal accounts in a manner to ensure  the impartial administration of the trust. The administration of the  trust in accordance with the state statute will not be considered to  shift any beneficial interest in the trust. Therefore, the trust will  not be subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue  Code. Further, under these facts, no trust beneficiary will be treated  as having made a gift for federal gift tax purposes, and neither the  trust nor any trust beneficiary will be treated as having made a taxable  exchange for federal income tax purposes. Similarly, the conclusions in  this example would be the same if the change in administration of the  trust occurred because the situs of the trust was changed to State X  from a state whose statute does not authorize the trustee to make  adjustments between income and principal or if the situs was changed to  such a state from State X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective dates. The rules in this paragraph (b)(4) are  generally applicable on and after December 20, 2000. However, the rule  in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(D)(2) of this section and  Example 11 and Example 12 in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section  regarding the administration of a trust and the determination of income  in conformance with applicable state law applies to trusts for taxable  years ending after January 2, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions to additions rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Any addition to a  trust made pursuant to an instrument or arrangement covered by the  transition rules in paragraph (b) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is not  treated as an addition for purposes of this section. Moreover, any  property transferred inter vivos to a trust is not treated as an  addition if the same property would have been added to the trust  pursuant to an instrument covered by the transition rules in paragraph  (b) (2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Addition pursuant to terms of exempt instrument. On  December 31, 1980, T created an irrevocable trust having a principal of  $100,000. Under the terms of the trust, the principal was to be held for  the benefit of T's grandchild, GC. Pursuant to the terms of T's will, a  document entitled to relief under the transition rule of paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, the residue of the estate was paid to the trust.  Because the addition to the trust was paid pursuant to the terms of an  instrument (T's will) that is not subject to the provisions of chapter  13 because of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the payment to the trust  is not considered an addition to the principal of the trust. Thus,  distributions to or for the benefit of GC, are not subject to the  provisions of chapter 13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Property transferred inter vivos that would have been  transferred to the same trust by the transferor's will. T is the grantor  of a trust that was irrevocable on September 25, 1985. T's will, which  was executed before October 22, 1986, and not amended thereafter,  provides that, upon T's death, the entire estate will pour over into T's  trust. On October 1, 1985, T transfers $100,000 to the trust. While T's  will otherwise qualifies for relief under the transition rule in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the transition rule is not applicable  unless T dies prior to January 1, 1987. Thus, if T dies after December  31, 1986, the transfer is treated as an addition to the trust for  purposes of any distribution made from the trust after the transfer to  the trust on October 1, 1985. If T dies before January 1, 1987, the  entire trust (as well as any distributions from or terminations of  interests in the trust prior to T's death) is exempt, under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, from chapter 13 because the $100,000 would have  been added to the trust under a will that would have qualified under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In either case, for any generation- skipping transfers made after the transfer to the trust on October 1,  1985, but before T's death, the $100,000 is treated as an addition to  the trust and a proportionate amount of the trust is subject to chapter  13.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Pour over to a revocable trust. T and S are the settlors  of separate revocable trusts with equal values. Both trusts were  established for the benefit of skip persons (as defined in section  2613). S dies on December 1, 1985, and under the provisions of S's  trust, the principal pours over into T's trust. If T dies before January  1, 1987, the entire trust is excluded under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section from the operation of chapter 13. If T dies after December 31,  1986, the entire trust is subject to the generation-skipping transfer  tax provisions because T's trust is not a trust described in paragraph  (b)(1) or (2) of this section. In the latter case, the fact that S died  before January 1, 1987, is irrelevant because the principal of S's trust  was added to a trust that never qualified under the transition rules of  paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Pour over to exempt trust. Assume the same facts as in  Example 3, except upon the death of S on December 1, 1985, S's trust  continues as an irrevocable trust and that the principal of T's trust is  to be paid over upon T's death to S's trust. Again, if T dies before  January 1, 1987, S's entire trust falls within the provisions of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, if T dies after December 31,  1986, the pour-over is considered an addition to the trust. Therefore,  S's trust is not a trust excluded under paragraph (b)(2) of this section  because an addition is made to the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Lapse of a general power of appointment. S, the spouse of  the settlor of an irrevocable trust that was created in 1980, had, on  September 25, 1985, a general power of appointment over the trust  assets. The trust provides that should S fail to exercise the power of  appointment the property is to remain in the trust. On October 21, 1986,  S executed a will under which S failed to exercise the power of  appointment. If S dies before January 1, 1987, without having exercised  the power in a manner which results in the creation of, or increase in  the amount of, a generation-skipping transfer (or amended the will in a  manner that results in the creation of, or increase in the amount of, a  generation-skipping transfer), transfers pursuant to the trust or the  will are not subject to chapter 13 because the trust is an irrevocable  trust and the will qualifies under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Lapse of general power of appointment held by intestate  decedent. Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except on October 22,  1986, S did not have a will and that S dies after that date. Upon S's  death, or upon the prior exercise or release of the power, the value of  the entire trust is treated as having been distributed to S, and S is  treated as having made an addition to the trust in the amount of the  entire principal. Any distribution or termination pursuant to the trust  occurring after S's death is subject to chapter 13. It is immaterial  whether S's death occurs before January 1, 1987, since paragraph (b)(2)  of this section is only applicable where a will or revocable trust was  executed before October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Additional effective dates. Except as otherwise provided, the  regulations under Sec. Sec. 26.2611-1, 26.2612-1, 26.2613-1, 26.2632-1,  26.2641-1, 26.2642-1, 26.2642-2, 26.2642-3, 26.2642-4, 26.2642-5,  26.2652-1, 26.2652-2, 26.2653-1, 26.2654-1, 26.2663-1, and 26.2663-2 are  effective with respect   to generation-skipping transfers as defined in Sec. 26.2611-1 made on  or after December 27, 1995. However, taxpayers may, at their option,  rely on these regulations in the case of generation-skipping transfers  made, and trusts that became irrevocable, after December 23, 1992, and  before December 27, 1995. The last four sentences in paragraph (b)(1)(i)  of this section are applicable on and after November 18, 1999.
