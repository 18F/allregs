                            <p class="depth0">Any miner who wishes to obtain a medical examination at the miner's own expense at an approved spirometry or radiography facility and to have the complete examination submitted to NIOSH may do so, provided that the examination is made no sooner than 6 months after the most recent examination of the miner submitted to NIOSH. NIOSH will provide interpretation and radiographic classification and reporting of the results of examinations made at the miner's expense in the same manner as if they were submitted under an operator's plan. Any change in the miner's transfer rights under the Act that may result from this examination will be subject to the terms of Sec.  37.102.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart_Autopsies</p><p class="depth0">Authority: Sec. 508, 83 Stat. 803; 30 U.S.C. 957.</p><p class="depth0">Source: 36 FR 8870, May 14, 1971, unless otherwise noted.</p>
