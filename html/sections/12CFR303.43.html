Absent such removal, an application processed under expedited processing will be deemed approved on the latest of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 21st day after receipt by the FDIC of a substantially complete filing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 5th day after expiration of the comment period described in Sec. 303.44; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an application to establish and operate a de novo branch in a state that is not the applicant's home state and in which the applicant does not maintain a branch, the 5th day after the FDIC receives confirmation from the host state that the applicant has both complied with the filing requirements of the host state and submitted a copy of the application with the FDIC to the host state bank supervisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard processing. For those applications which are not processed pursuant to the expedited procedures, the FDIC will provide the applicant with written notification of the final action when the decision is rendered.</p>
