                                Sec. 30.4  Electronic Export Information filing procedures, deadlines,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Two electronic filing options (predeparture and postdeparture) for  transmitting EEI are available to the USPPI or authorized agent. The  electronic postdeparture filing takes into account that complete  information concerning export shipments may not always be available  prior to exportation and accommodates these circumstances by providing,  when authorized, for filing of EEI after departure. For example, for  exports of seasonal and agricultural commodities, only estimated  quantities, values, and consignees may be known prior to exportation.  The procedures for obtaining certification as an AES filer and for  applying for authorization to file on a postdeparture basis are  described in Sec. 30.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EEI transmitted predeparture. The EEI shall always be  transmitted prior to departure for the following types of shipments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S.  Customs and Border Protection regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Essential and precursor chemicals requiring a permit from the  DEA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shipments defined as ``sensitive'' by Executive Order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Shipments where a U.S. government agency requires predeparture  filing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Shipments defined as ``routed export transactions'' (see Sec.  30.3(e));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Shipments where complete outbound manifests are required prior  to clearing vessels going directly to the countries identified in U.S.  Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and aircraft  going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S. Customs and  Border Protection regulation 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Items identified on the USML of the ITAR (22 CFR 121);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Shipments that require a license from the BIS and exports listed  under BIS's grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status (see 15  CFR 758.2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Shipments that require a license from the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Shipments of rough diamonds classified under HS subheadings  7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31 and exported (reexported) in accordance  with the Kimberley Process; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Shipments for which the USPPI has not been approved for  postdeparture filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing deadlines for EEI transmitted predeparture. The USPPI or  the authorized agent shall file the required EEI and have received the  AES ITN no later than the time period specified as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em> for  specific requirements concerning predeparture filing time frames. In  addition, if a filer is unable to acquire an ITN because the AES or  AESDirect is not operating, the filer shall not export until the AES is  operating and an ITN is acquired. The downtime filing citation is not to  be used when the filer's system is down or experiencing delays.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For non-USML shipments, except shipments between the United  States and Puerto Rico, file the EEI and provide the ITN as follows (See  Sec. 30.4(b)(3), for filing timeframes for shipments between the United  States and Puerto Rico):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For vessel cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file  the EEI required by Sec. 30.6 and provide the filing citation or  exemption legend to the exporting carrier twenty-four hours prior to  loading cargo on the vessel at the U.S. port where the cargo is laden.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For air cargo, including cargo being transported by Air Express  Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required  by Sec. 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the  exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to the scheduled  departure time of the aircraft.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For truck cargo, including cargo departing by Express  Consignment Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the  EEI required by Sec. 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption  legend to the exporting carrier no later than one (1) hour prior to the  arrival of the truck at the United States border to go foreign.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For rail cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file  the EEI required by Sec. 30.6 and provide the filing citation or  exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours  prior to the time the train arrives at the U.S. border to go foreign.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For mail and cargo shipped by other methods, except pipeline,  the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by Sec.  30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the  exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation. (See  Sec. 30.46 for filing deadlines for shipments sent by pipeline.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For all other modes, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall  file the required EEI no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico, the AES  proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, or exemption  citation must be presented to the carrier by the time the shipment  arrives at the port of unloading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For non-USML shipments when the AES or AESDirect is unavailable,  use the following instructions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the participant's AES is unavailable, the filer must delay  the export of the goods or find an alternative filing method;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If AES or AESDirect is unavailable, the goods may be exported  and the filer must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Provide the appropriate downtime filing citation as described in  Sec. 30.7(b) and Appendix D; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Report the EEI at the first opportunity AES or AESDirect is  available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of  U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations, the USPPI or the  authorized agent shall file the EEI as required by Sec. 30.6 and  provide the filing citation to the CBP at least 72 hours prior to  export.

Postdeparture filing is only  available for approved USPPIs and provides for the electronic filing of  the data elements required by Sec. 30.6 no later than five (5) calendar  days after the date of exportation. For USPPIs approved for  postdeparture filing, all shipments (other than those for which  predeparture filing is specifically required), by all methods of  transportation, may be exported with the filing of EEI made  postdeparture. Authorized agents or service centers may transmit  information postdeparture on behalf of USPPIs approved for postdeparture  filing, or the approved USPPI may transmit the data postdeparture  itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proof of filing citation and exemption and exclusion legends.  The USPPI or the authorized agent shall provide the exporting carrier  with the proof of filing citation and exemption and exclusion legends as  described in Sec. 30.7.
