                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct costs means those expenditures which the National  Mediation Board actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, in  the case of commercial requesters, reviewing documents to respond to a  FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the  employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee  plus sixteen percent of the rate to cover benefits) and the cost of  operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are  overhead expenses such as costs of space and heating or lighting the  facility in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search includes all time spent looking for material that is  responsive to a request, including page-by-page and line-by-line  identification of material within documents. Searches may be done  manually or by computer using existing programming.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document  necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of  paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine readable  documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review refers to the process of examining documents located in  response to a commercial use request (see paragraph (a)(5) of this  section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is  permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for  disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and  otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent  resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of  exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf of  one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the  commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on  whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester  properly belongs in this category, the NMB will look first to the use  which a requester will put the document requested. Where the NMB has  reasonable cause to doubt the use is not clear from the request itself,  the National Mediation Board may seek additional clarification before  assigning the request to a specific category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or  private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an  institution of professional education and an institution of vocational  education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Non-commercial scientific institution refers to an institution  that is not operated on a commercial basis as that term is defined in  paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for the  purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not  intended to promote any particular product or industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Representative of the news media refers to any person actively  gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish  or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means information  that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the  public. These examples are not intended to be all inclusive. In the case  of ``freelance'' journalists,   they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they  demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that  organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication  contract would be the clearest proof, but the NMB may also look to the  past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions of fee charges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the exception of requesters  seeking documents for a commercial use, the NMB will provide the first  100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without  charge. The word ``pages'' in this paragraph (b) refers to paper copies  of standard size, usually 8.5 x 11, or their  equivalent in microfiche or computer disks. The term ``search time'' in  this paragraph (b) is based on a manual search for records. In applying  this term to searches made by computer, when the cost of the search as  set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section equals the equivalent  dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the  search, the NMB will begin assessing charges for computer search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NMB will not charge fees to any requester, including  commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting the fee would be  equal to or greater than the fee itself.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The NMB will provide documents without charge or at reduced  charges if disclosure of the information is in the public interest  because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding  of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily  in the commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest  under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the NMB will consider the  following factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed.  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  general public likely to result from disclosure. Whether disclosure of  the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The significance of the contributions to the public  understanding. Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute  ``significantly'' to public understanding of government operations or  activities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether  the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  requested disclosure; and, if so</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of the  identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large,  in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is  ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A request for a fee waiver based on the public interest under  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must address the factors of  paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section as they apply to the request for  records in order to be considered by the Chief of Staff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Level of fees to be charged. The level of fees to be charged by  the NMB in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph (d) of  this section, depends on the category of the requester. The fee levels  to be charged are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for documents appearing to be for commercial use will  be charged to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing  for release, and duplicating the records sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for documents from an educational or non-commercial  scientific institution will be charged for the cost of reproduction  alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for  inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is  being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the  records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in  furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational  institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial  scientific institution) research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The NMB shall provide documents to requesters who are  representatives of the news media for the cost of reproduction alone,  excluding charges for the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The NMB shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the  categories above such fees which recover the full direct cost of  searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the  request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first  two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. All  requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following fees shall be charged in accordance with paragraph  (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual searches for records. The salary rate (i.e., basic pay  plus sixteen percent) of the employee(s) making the search. Search time  under this paragraph and paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be charged  for even if the NMB fails to locate responsive records or if records  located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computer searches for records. The actual direct cost of  providing the service, including computer search time directly  attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request,  runs, and operator salary apportionable to the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review of records. The salary rate (i.e., basic pay plus sixteen  percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review. This charge applies  only to requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use and only  to the review necessary at the initial administrative level to determine  the applicability of any relevant FOIA exemptions, and not at the  administrative appeal level or an exemption already applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Certification or authentication of records. $2.00 per  certification or authentication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Duplication of records. Fifteen cents per page for paper copy  reproduction of documents, which the NMB determined is the reasonable  direct cost of making such copies taking into account the average salary  of the operator and the cost of the reproduction machinery. For copies  of records prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the NMB  shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production of  the tape or printout.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Forwarding material to destination. Postage, insurance and  special fees will be charged on an actual cost basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other costs. All other direct costs of preparing a response to a  request shall be charged to requester in the same amount as incurred by  NMB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Aggregating requests. When the NMB reasonably believes that a  requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request down  into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of  fees, the NMB will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Charging interest. Interest at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C.  3717 may be charged those requesters who fail to pay fees charged,  beginning on the thirtieth day following the billing date. Receipt of a  fee by the NMB, whether processed or not, will stay the accrual of  interest. If a debt is not paid, the agency may use the provisions of  the Debt Collection Act of 1982, (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749)  including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, for the purpose of  obtaining payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Advance payments. The NMB will not require a requester to make  an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued  on a request, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NMB estimates or determines that allowable charges that a  requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then the NMB  will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory  assurances of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt  payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to  the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of  payment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section, the administrative time limits  prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., twenty working days  from receipt of initial requests and twenty working days from receipt of  appeals from initial denial, plus permissible extension of these time  limits) will begin only after the NMB has received fee payments  described in this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment. Payment of fees shall be made by check or money order  payable to the United States Treasury.  [63 FR 44395, Aug. 19, 1998]</p>
