                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Priority System. To the extent possible, CDPs shall be offered to the qualifying children of eligible patrons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Priority 1. The highest priority for full-time care shall be given to qualifying children from birth through 12 years of age of combat related wounded warriors, child development program direct care staff, single or dual active duty Military Service members, single or dual DoD civilian employees paid from APF and NAF, surviving spouses of military members who died from a combat related incident, and those acting in loco parentis on behalf of the aforementioned eligible patrons. With the exception of combat related wounded warriors, ALL eligible parents or caregivers residing with the child are employed outside the home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Priority 2. The second priority for full-time care shall be given equally to qualifying children from birth through 12 years of age of active duty Military Service members, DoD civilian employees paid from APF and NAF, surviving spouses of military members who died from a combat related incident, and those acting in loco parentis on behalf of the aforementioned eligible patrons, where a non-working spouse, or in the case of a DoD civilian employee with a same-sex domestic partner, is actively seeking employment. The status of actively seeking employment must be verified every 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priority 3. The third priority for full-time care shall be given equally to qualifying children from birth through 12 years of age of active duty Military Service members, DoD civilian employees paid from APF and NAF, surviving spouses of military members who died from a combat related incident, and those acting in loco parentis on behalf of the aforementioned eligible patrons, where a non-working spouse, or in the case of a DoD civilian employee with a same-sex domestic partner, is enrolled in an accredited post-secondary institution. The status of post-secondary enrollment must be verified every 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Space Available. After meeting the needs of parents in priorities 1, 2, and 3, CDPs shall support the need for full-time care for other eligible patrons such as active duty Military Service members with non-working spouses, DoD civilian employees paid from APF and NAF with non-working spouses or same-sex domestic partners, eligible employees of DoD Contractors, Federal employees from non-DoD agencies, and military retirees on a space available basis. In this category, CDPs may also authorize otherwise ineligible patrons in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1783, 1791 through 1800, 2809, and 2812 to enroll in the CDP to make more efficient use of DoD facilities and resources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Individual priorities will be determined based on the date of application with the DoD Component. Components may only establish sub-priorities if unique mission related installation requirements are identified by higher headquarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Types of Care. The types of care offered for children from birth through 12 years of age include 24/7 care and care provided on a full-day, part-day, short-term or intermittent basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Military-Operated CDPs.

For SAC, there are never more than thirty children per group.In multi-age groupings, the Service may follow the ratio per age group.</p><p class="depth0">For example, four infants and five pre-toddlers equal a group of nine</p><p class="depth0">with two direct care personnel, or seven toddlers and twelve</p><p class="depth0">preschoolers equal a group of nineteen with two direct care personnel.Volunteers or persons under 18 years of age may not be counted in</p><p class="depth0">determining compliance with staff-to-child ratios and are not allowed</p><p class="depth0">to work alone with children.The program has an accountability system in place. Each staff member has</p><p class="depth0">primary responsibility and accountability for a group of children.</p><p class="depth0">There is specific accountability for each child by one staff member.</p><p class="depth0">Systems are in place for accounting for children's whereabouts,</p><p class="depth0">especially during periods of transition and emergencies.Children are released only to their parents or guardian. Children may be</p><p class="depth0">released to a designee when signed permission is given by the parent or</p><p class="depth0">guardian.Families are notified about procedures and policies for field trips.</p><p class="depth0">Families are notified of all activities outside the center.Children are under adult supervision at all times. Staff are not</p><p class="depth0">permitted to use personal electronic devices (including, but not</p><p class="depth0">limited to cell phones, iPods, smart phones, etc.) when supervising</p><p class="depth0">children.------------------------------------------------------------------------CDC Only------------------------------------------------------------------------At least two staff members must be present with each group of children</p><p class="depth0">at all times. When one staff person is alone with a single ratio of</p><p class="depth0">children, the program director or designee frequently monitors the room</p><p class="depth0">through closed circuit television or visual access panels to ensure</p><p class="depth0">oversight by more than one adult. In this case, the staff member must</p><p class="depth0">have an initiated National Agency Check Investigation (NACI) and the</p><p class="depth0">program director or designee must have a completed NACI.Infants and toddlers spend the majority of the time interacting with</p><p class="depth0">staff who have primary responsibility for them each day.------------------------------------------------------------------------SAC Only------------------------------------------------------------------------At least two paid staff members shall be present whenever children are</p><p class="depth0">in the facility.Adult volunteers may supplement paid staff during field trips and other</p><p class="depth0">activities away from the facility. Only paid staff are counted in the</p><p class="depth0">ratio.Signed permission is given by the parent allowing the child to self-</p><p class="depth0">release for a specific organized activity. Self-release procedures are</p><p class="depth0">consistent with the installation home alone policy or self-care policy.------------------------------------------------------------------------I. Child Abuse Prevention and Reporting------------------------------------------------------------------------Both CDC and SAC------------------------------------------------------------------------A NACI to include a name-based criminal history record check (State and</p><p class="depth0">Federal) and fingerprint check has been initiated on all staff.</p><p class="depth0">Background checks are tracked to ensure completion in a timely manner.All individuals in a CDP who have contact with children have completed a</p><p class="depth0">DD Form X656 ``Basic Criminal History and Statement of Admission''Updates to the background checks are completed every five years.Newly hired staff without a completed background check are readily</p><p class="depth0">identifiable and work within line of sight of a staff member with a</p><p class="depth0">completed check.Hiring practices include careful checking of references of all potential</p><p class="depth0">employees and volunteers.The program has a written guidance, discipline, and touch policy that is</p><p class="depth0">available to staff and families. Staff do not use corporal punishment</p><p class="depth0">or other negative discipline methods that hurt, humiliate, or frighten</p><p class="depth0">children.</p><p class="depth0">The program has a child abuse and neglect policy that includes reporting</p><p class="depth0">requirements for staff as well as procedures to be followed should a</p><p class="depth0">staff member be accused of abuse or neglect. This information is</p><p class="depth0">included in employee handbooks. All staff are knowledgeable of the</p><p class="depth0">policy.The DoD Child Abuse and Safety Hotline telephone number is displayed in</p><p class="depth0">a highly visible area where parents can see it. The telephone number is</p><p class="depth0">published in parent handbooks and other brochures.The facility is designed in accordance with the Unified Facilities</p><p class="depth0">Criteria (UFC) 4-740-14, ``Design: Child Development Centers,'' to help</p><p class="depth0">minimize the risk of child abuse:</p><p class="depth0">a.
