                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission may hear oral argument either on its own motion  or upon the written request of a party. If oral argument before the  Commission is desired on exceptions to an initial or recommended  decision, or on a motion, petition, or application, a request therefor  shall be made in writing. Any party may make such a request irrespective  of its filing exceptions under Sec. 502.227. If a brief on exceptions  is filed, the request for oral argument shall be incorporated in such  brief. Requests for oral argument on any motion, petition, or  application shall be made in the motion, petition, or application, or in  the reply thereto. If the Commission determines to hear oral argument, a  notice will be issued setting forth the order of presentation and the  amount of time allotted to each party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for oral argument will be granted or denied in the  discretion of the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties requesting oral argument shall set forth the specific  issues they propose to address at oral argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Those who appear before the Commission for oral argument shall  confine their argument to points of controlling importance raised on  exceptions or replies thereto. Where the facts of a case are adequately  and accurately dealt with in the initial or recommended decision,  parties should, as far as possible, address themselves in argument to  the conclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effort should be made by parties taking the same position to  agree in advance of the argument upon those persons who are to present  their side of the case, and the names of such persons and the amount of  time requested should be received by the Commission not later than ten  (10) days before the date set for the argument. The fewer the number of  persons making the argument the more effectively can the parties'  interests be presented in the time allotted.
