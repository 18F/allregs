                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> GS employees. For a GS employee, an equivalent increase is  considered to occur at the time of any of the following personnel  actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A within-grade increase, excluding a quality step increase  granted under subpart E of this part or an interim within-grade increase  if that increase is later terminated under Sec. 531.414;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A promotion (permanent or temporary) to a higher grade,  including the promotion of an employee receiving a retained rate under 5  CFR 359.705 or 5 CFR part 536 that does not result in a pay increase,  but excluding--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A temporary promotion if, at the end of the that temporary  promotion, the employee is returned to the grade from which promoted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A promotion to a higher-graded supervisory or managerial  position when the employee does not satisfactorily complete a  probationary period established under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) and is  returned to a position at the lower grade held before promotion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application of the maximum payable rate rule in Sec. 531.221  that results in a higher step rate within the employee's GS grade (or an  increase for a GM employee to the next higher rate within the grade),  except for application of that rule in a demotion to the extent that the  employee's rate of basic pay after demotion does not exceed the lowest  step rate that equals or exceeds the employee's rate of basic pay  immediately before the demotion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application of the superior qualifications and special needs  pay-setting authority in Sec. 531.212 that results in a higher step  rate within the employee's GS grade (or an increase for a GM employee to  the next higher rate within the grade); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Application of the qualifications pay authority in 5 U.S.C. 9814  to an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  when the employee fulfills the 1-year service requirement in the  position for which qualifications pay was paid or in a successor  position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-GS employees who move to the GS pay system. When an employee  performs service under a non-GS pay system for Federal employees and  that service is potentially creditable towards a GS within-grade  increase waiting period, an equivalent increase is considered to occur  at the time of any of the following personnel actions in the non-GS pay  system:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A promotion to a higher grade or work level within the non-GS  pay system (unless the promotion is cancelled and the employee's rate of  basic pay is redetermined as if the promotion had not occurred); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An opportunity to receive a within-level or within-range  increase that   results in forward movement in the applicable range of rates of basic  pay (including an increase granted immediately upon movement to the non- GS pay system from another pay system--e.g., to account for the value of  accrued within-grade increases under the former pay system or to provide  a promotion-equivalent increase), where ``forward movement in the  applicable range'' means any kind of increase in the employee's rate of  basic pay other than an increase that is directly and exclusively linked  to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A general structural increase in the employee's basic pay  schedule or rate range (including the adjustment of a range minimum or  maximum); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee's placement under a new basic pay schedule within  the same pay system, when such placement results in a nondiscretionary  basic pay increase to account for occupational pay differences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Locality rates and special rates. Since locality rates under  subpart F of this part and special rates under 5 CFR part 530, subpart  C, and similar rates under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455)  are not rates of basic pay for the purpose of this subpart, increases in  pay resulting from an adjustment in an employee's locality payment or  special rate supplement or from placement on a new locality rate or  special rate schedule are not considered in making equivalent increase  determinations.
