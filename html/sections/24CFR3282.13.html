                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for  voluntary certification of non-conforming manufactured homes as required  by 42 U.S.C. 5402(6) as amended by section 308(d)(B) of the Housing and  Community Development Act of 1980.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Structures which meet all of the requirements of a manufactured  home as set out in Sec. 3282.7(u), except the size requirements, shall  be manufactured homes if the manufacturer files with the Secretary a  certification in the following form:</p><p class="depth2">[Name of manufacturer and address where structures are to be  manufactured] certifies that it intends to manufacture structures that  meet all of the requirements of manufactured homes set forth at 42  U.S.C. 5402(6) except the size requirements. Such structures are to be  treated as manufactured homes for the purposes of the National  Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and  the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Such structures will be  built in conformance with the Standards. [Name of manufacturer] further  certifies that if, at any time it manufactures structures which are not  manufactured homes, it will identify each such structure by a permanent  serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of  production and that the series of serial numbers for such structures  shall be distinguishable on the structures and in its records from the  series of serial numbers used for manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever a manufacturer which has filed a certification pursuant  to Sec. 3282.13(b) produces structures which are not manufactured  homes, it must identify each such structure by placing a permanent  serial number on the structure during the first stage of production. The  series of serial numbers placed on these structures shall be  distinguishable on the structure and in the manufacturer's records from  the series of serial numbers used for manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A manufacturer may certify a structure as a manufactured home  after having applied a serial number identifying it as a structure which  is not a manufactured home. To do so, the manufacturer must secure the  written consent of the IPIA. This consent may only be given after a  DAPIA has approved the manufacturer's design and quality assistance  manual in accordance with Sec. 3282.361, and after the IPIA has  thoroughly inspected the structure in at least one stage of production  and after such removal of equipment, components or materials as the IPIA  may require to assure that the structure conforms to the standards.  After certification as a manufactured home has been approved, the  manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial  number required by Sec. 3280.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Once a manufacturer has certified under Sec. 3282.13(b) that it  intends to build structures which are manufactured homes in all respects  except size, the manufacturer must then, with respect to those  structures, comply with all of the requirements of the Act and its  regulations. The structures may not thereafter be exempted under any  other section of these regulations.  [47 FR 28093, June 29, 1982]</p>
