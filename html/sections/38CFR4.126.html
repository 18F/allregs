                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neurocognitive disorders shall be evaluated under the general rating formula for mental disorders; neurologic deficits or other impairments stemming from the same etiology (e.g., a head injury) shall be evaluated separately and combined with the evaluation for neurocognitive disorders (see Sec.  4.25).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a single disability has been diagnosed both as a physical condition and as a mental disorder, the rating

agency shall evaluate it using a diagnostic code which represents the dominant (more disabling) aspect of the condition (see Sec.  4.14).
