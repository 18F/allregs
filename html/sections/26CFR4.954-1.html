                                Sec. 4.954-1  Foreign base company income; taxable years beginning after
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and scope. Section 954 (b) through (g)  and Sec. Sec. 1.954-1T and 1.954-2T provide rules for computing the  foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation. Foreign  base company income is included in the subpart F income of a controlled  foreign corporation under the rules of section 952 and the regulations  thereunder. Subpart F income is included in the gross income of a United  States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation under the rules  of section 951 and the regulations thereunder, and thus is subject to  current taxation under section 1 or 11 of the Code. The determination of  whether a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, the  subpart F income of which is included currently in the gross income of  its United States shareholders, is made under the rules of section 957  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross foreign base company income. For taxable years of a  controlled foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, the  gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation  consists of the following categories of gross income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Its foreign personal holding company income, as defined in  section 954(c) and Sec. 1.954-2T,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Its foreign base company sales income, as defined in section  954(d) and the regulations thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Its foreign base company services income, as defined in  section 954(e) and the regulations thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Its foreign base company shipping income, as defined in section  954(f) and the regulations thereunder, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Its foreign base company oil related income, as defined in  section 954(g) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjusted gross foreign base company income. The term ``adjusted  gross foreign base company income'' means the gross foreign base company  income of a controlled foreign corporation as adjusted by the de minimis  and full inclusion rules of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Net foreign base company income. The term ``net foreign base  company income'' means the adjusted gross foreign base company income of  a controlled foreign corporation reduced so as to take account of  deductions properly allocable to such income under the rules of section  954(b)(5) and paragraph (c) of this section. In computing net foreign  base company income, foreign personal holding company income is reduced  (but not below zero) by related person interest expense before  allocating and apportioning other expenses in accordance with the rules  of paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 1.904(d)-5(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjusted net foreign base company income. The term ``adjusted  net foreign base company income'' means the net foreign base company  income of a controlled foreign corporation reduced by any items of net  foreign base company income for which the high tax exception of  paragraph (d) of this section is elected. The term ``foreign base  company income'' as used in the Code and elsewhere in the regulations  generally means adjusted net foreign base company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Insurance income definitions. The term ``gross insurance  income'' includes any item of gross income taken into account in  determining insurance income under section 953 and the regulations  thereunder. The term ``adjusted gross insurance income'' means gross  insurance income as adjusted by the de minimis and full inclusion rules  of paragraph (b) of this section. The term ``net insurance income''  means adjusted gross insurance income reduced under section 953 and the  regulations thereunder so as to take into account deductions properly  allocable or apportionable to such income. The term ``adjusted net  insurance income'' means net insurance income reduced by any items of  net insurance income for which the high tax exception of paragraph (d)  of this section is elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Additional items of adjusted net foreign base company income or  adjusted net insurance income by reason of section 952(c). Earnings and  profits of the controlled foreign corporation that are recharacterized  as foreign base company income or insurance income under section 952(c)  are items of adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net  insurance income. Thus, they are not included in the gross foreign base  company income or gross insurance income of the controlled foreign  corporation in computing adjusted gross foreign base company income or  adjusted gross insurance income (for purposes of applying the de minimis  and full inclusion tests of paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> and in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section involving the operation of section  952(c) are included for purposes of illustration only and do not provide  substantive rules concerning the operation of that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation,  has gross income of $1000 for the current taxable year. Of that $1000 of  income, $100 is interest income that is included in the definition of  foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and  Sec. 1.954-2T(b)(1)(ii), is not income from a trade or service  receivable described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), and is not excluded  from foreign personal holding company income under any provision of  section 954(c) and Sec. 1.954-2T. Another $50 is foreign base company  sales income under section 954(d) and the regulations thereunder. The  remaining $850 of gross income is not included in the definition of  foreign base company income or insurance income under sections 954(c),  (d), (e), (f), (g), or 953 and the regulations thereunder, and is  foreign source general limitation income described in section  904(d)(1)(I) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses. CFC has expenses for the current taxable year of  $500. Of that $500, $8 is from interest paid to a related person and is  allocable to foreign personal holding company income along with $2 of  other expense. Another $20 of expense is allocable to foreign base  company sales. The remaining $470 of expense is allocable to income  other than   foreign base company income or insurance income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Earnings and deficits. CFC has earnings and profits for the  current taxable year of $500. In the prior taxable year, CFC had losses  with respect to income other than gross foreign base company income or  gross insurance income. By reason of the limitation provided under  section 952(c)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder, those losses  reduced the subpart F income (consisting entirely of foreign source  general limitation income) of CFC by $600 for the prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxes. Foreign tax of $30 is considered imposed on the interest  income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this  section. Foreign tax of $14 is considered imposed on the foreign base  company sales income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph  (d) of this section. Foreign tax of $177 is considered imposed on the  remaining foreign source general limitation income under the rules of  section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section. For the taxable  year of the foreign corporation, the maximum U.S. rate of taxation under  section 11 is 34 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Conclusion. Based on these facts, if CFC elects to exclude all  items of income subject to a high foreign tax under section 954(b)(4)  and paragraph (d), it will have $500 of subpart F income as defined in  section 952(a) (consisting entirely of foreign source general limitation  income) determined as follows. The following steps do not illustrate the  computation of the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation  that has income from a trade or service receivable treated as interest  under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0">Step 1--Determine gross income:  (1) Gross income...................................................$1000  Step

adjusted gross insurance income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> De minimis rule, etc.--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If the de minimis rule of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section  applies, then adjusted gross foreign base company income and adjusted  gross insurance income are each equal to zero. If the full inclusion  rule of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, then adjusted  gross foreign base company income consists of all items of gross income  of the controlled foreign corporation other than gross insurance income,  and adjusted gross insurance income consists of all items of gross  insurance income. Otherwise, the adjusted gross foreign base company  income of a controlled foreign corporation consists of the gross foreign  base company income of the controlled foreign corporation, and the  adjusted gross insurance income of a controlled foreign corporation  consists of the gross insurance income of the controlled foreign  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> applies if the sum of the gross  foreign base company income and the gross insurance income of a  controlled foreign corporation is less than the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 5 percent of gross income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $1,000,000.  Controlled foreign corporations having a functional currency other than  the U.S. dollar shall translate the $1,000,000 threshold using the  exchange rate provided under section 989(b)(3) and the regulations  thereunder for amounts included in income under section 951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Coordination with section 864(d). Gross foreign base company  income or gross insurance income of a controlled foreign corporation  always includes items of income from trade or service receivables  described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), even if the de minimis rule of  this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is otherwise applicable. In that case,  adjusted gross foreign base company income consists only of the items of  income from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d)(1)  or (6) that are included in gross foreign base company income, and  adjusted gross insurance income consists only of the items of income  from trade or service receivables described in section 864(d)(1) or (6)  that are included in gross insurance income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies if the sum of the foreign base  company income and the gross insurance income for the taxable year  exceeds 70 percent of gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Character of items of gross income included in adjusted gross  foreign base company income. The items of gross income included in the  adjusted gross foreign base company income of a controlled foreign  corporation retain their character as foreign personal holding   company income, foreign base company sales income, foreign base company  services income, foreign base company shipping income, or foreign base  company oil related income. Items of gross income included in adjusted  gross income because the full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of  this section is met are termed ``full inclusion foreign base company  income,'' and constitute a separate category of adjusted gross foreign  base company income for purposes of allocating and apportioning  deductions under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with section 952(c). Items of gross foreign base  company income or gross insurance income that are excluded from adjusted  foreign base company income or adjusted gross insurance income because  the de minimis test of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is met are  potentially subject to recharacterization as adjusted net foreign base  company income or adjusted net insurance income (or other categories of  income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952  and the regulations thereunder) for the taxable year under the rules of  section 952(c). Items of full inclusion foreign base company income that  are included in adjusted gross foreign base company income because the  full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is met, and  are included in subpart F income under section 952 and the regulations  thereunder, do not reduce amounts that, under section 952(c), are  subject to recharacterization in later years on account of deficits in  prior years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Anti-abuse rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of applying the de  minimis and full inclusion tests of paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  the income of two or more controlled foreign corporations shall be  aggregated and treated as the income of a single corporation if one  principal purpose for separately organizing, acquiring, or maintaining  such multiple corporations is to avoid the application of the de minimis  or full inclusion requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For  purposes of this paragraph (b), a principal purpose need not be the  purpose of first importance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Presumption. Two or more controlled foreign corporations are  presumed to have been organized, acquired or maintained to avoid the  effect of the de minimis and full inclusion requirements of paragraph  (b)(1) of this section if the corporations are related persons as  defined in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (b)(4) and the  corporations are described in subdivision (A), (B), or (C). This  presumption may be rebutted by proof to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) may be rebutted by proof that the activities  carried on by each controlled foreign corporation would constitute a  separate branch under the principles of Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g) if carried  on directly by a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The controlled foreign corporations carry on a business,  financial operation, or venture as partners directly or indirectly in a  partnership (as defined in section 7701(a)(2) and Sec. 301.7701-3) that  is a related person (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph  (b)(4)) with respect to each such controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The activities carried on by the controlled foreign corporations  would constitute a single branch operation under Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g)(2)  if carried on directly by the United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related persons. For purposes of this paragraph (b), two or  more persons are related persons if they are in a relationship described  in section 267(b). In determining for purposes of this paragraph (b)  whether two or more corporations are members of the same controlled  group under section 267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned  directly by such person,   stock owned with the application of section 1563(e)(1), and stock owned  with the application of section 267(c). In determining for purposes of  this paragraph (b) whether a corporation is related to a partnership  under section 267(b)(10), a person is considered to own the partnership  interest owned directly by such person and the partnership interest  owned with the application of section 267(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates the application  of this paragraph (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Example. USP is the sole United States shareholder of three  controlled foreign corporations: CFC1, CFC2 and CFC3. The three  controlled foreign corporations all have the same taxable year. The  three controlled foreign corporations are partners in FP, a foreign  entity classified as a partnership under section 7701(a)(2) and Sec.  301.7701-3 of the regulations. For their current taxable years, each of  the controlled foreign corporations derives all of its income other than  foreign base company income from activities conducted through FP, and  its foreign base company income from activities conducted both jointly  through FP and separately without FP. Based on the facts in the table  below, for their current taxable years, the foreign base company income  derived by each controlled foreign corporation, including income derived  from FP, is less than five percent of the gross income of each  controlled foreign corporation and is less than $1,000,000:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">CFC1        CFC2         CFC3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gross income.......................  $4,000,000  $8,000,000  $12,000,000 Five percent of gross income.......     200,000     400,000      600,000 Foreign base company income........     199,000     398,000      597,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Thus, without the application of the anti-abuse rule of this  subparagraph (5), each controlled foreign corporation would be treated  as having no foreign base company income after the application of the de  minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.954-1T(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">However, under these facts the requirements of subdivision (i) of  this paragraph (b)(4) are presumed to be met. The sum of the foreign  base company income of the controlled foreign corporations is  $1,194,000. Thus, the amount of adjusted gross foreign base company  income will not be less than the amount of gross foreign base company  income by reason of the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and this  paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates computations  required by sections 952 and 954 and this Sec. 1.954-1T if the full  inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) is met (see paragraph (a)(8) for  an example illustrating computations required if the de minimis test of  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) is met):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross Income. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation,  has gross income of $1,000 for the current taxable year. Of that $1,000  of income, $720 is interest income that is included in the definition of  foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and  Sec. 1.954-2T(b)(ii), is not income from trade or service receivables  described in section 864(d) (1) or (6), and is not excluded from foreign  personal holding company income under any provisions of section 954(c)  and Sec. 1.954-2T. The remaining $280 is services income that is not  included in the definition of foreign base company income or insurance  income under sections 954(c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or 953 and the  regulations thereunder, and is foreign source general limitation income  for purposes of section 904(d)(1)(I).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses. CFC has expenses for the current taxable year of  $650. Of that $650, $350 is from interest paid to related persons that  is allocable to foreign personal holding company income along with $50  of other expense. The remaining $250 of expense is allocable to services  income other than foreign base company income or insurance income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Earnings and deficits. CFC has earnings and profits for the  current taxable year of $350. In the prior taxable year, CFC had losses  with respect to income other than foreign base company income or  insurance income. By reason of the limitation provided under section  952(c)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder, those losses reduced the  subpart F income of CFC (consisting entirely of foreign source general  limitation income) by $600 for the prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxes. A foreign tax of $120 is considered imposed on the $720  of interest income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph  (d) of this section, and a foreign tax of $2 is considered imposed on  the services income under the rules of section 954(b)(4) and paragraph  (d) of this section. For the taxable year of the foreign corporation,  the maximum U.S. rate of taxation under section 11 is 34 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Conclusion. Based on these facts, if CFC elects to exclude all  items of income subject to a high foreign tax under section 954(b)(4)  and paragraph (d), it will have $350 of subpart F income as defined in  section 952(a) determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1--Determine gross income:  (1) Gross income...................................................$1000</p><p class="depth0">Step 2--Compute gross foreign base company income and gross insurance</p><p class="depth0">income:  (2) Gross foreign base company income   and insurance income as defined in sections 954(c), (d), (e), (f), (g)  and 953 and the regulations thereunder (interest income).............720</p><p class="depth0">Step 3--Compute adjusted gross foreign base company income:  (3) Seventy percent of gross income (.70 x line (1)).................700 (4) Adjusted gross foreign base company income or insurance income after  the application of the full inclusion rule of this paragraph (b)(1)  (line (2), or line (1) if line (2) is greater than line (3))........1000 (5) Full inclusion foreign base company income under paragraph  (a)(2)(vi) (line (4) minus line (2)).................................280</p><p class="depth0">Step 4--Compute net foreign base company income:  (6) Related person interest expense and other deductions allocable and  apportionable to foreign personal holding company income under section  954(b)(5) and paragraph (c)..........................................400 (7) Deductions allocable and apportionable to full inclusion foreign  base company income under section 954(b)(5) and paragraph (c)........250 (8) Foreign personal holding company income after allocating deductions  under section 954(b)(5) and paragraph (c) of this section (line (2)  reduced (but not below zero) by line (6))............................320 (9) Full inclusion foreign base company income after allocating  deductions under section 954(b)(5) paragraph (c) of this section (line  (5) reduced (but not below zero) by line (7)).........................30 (10) Total gross foreign base company income after allocating deductions  under section 954(b)(5) and paragraph (c) (line (8) plus line (9))...350</p><p class="depth0">Step 5--Compute net insurance income:  (11) Net insurance income under section 953 and the regulations  thereunder.............................................................0</p><p class="depth0">Step 6--Compute adjusted net foreign base company income:  (12) Foreign tax imposed on foreign personal holding company income  (interest)...........................................................120 (13) Foreign tax imposed on full inclusion foreign base company income</p><p class="depth0">2 (14) Ninety percent of the maximum U.S. corporate tax rate..........30.6 (15) Effective rate of foreign tax imposed on $320 of foreign personal  holding company income under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) (line  (12) divided by line (8)).............................................38 (16) Effective rate of foreign tax imposed of $30 of full inclusion  foreign base company income under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d)  (line (13) divided by line (9))........................................7 (17) Foreign personal holding company income subject to a high foreign  tax under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) (zero, or line (8) if line  (15) is greater than line (14))......................................320 (18) Full inclusion foreign base company income subject to a high  foreign tax under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) (zero, or line (9)  if line (16) is greater than line (14))................................0 (19) Adjusted net foreign base company income after applying section  954(b)(4) and paragraph (d) (line (10), reduced by the sum of line (17)  and line (18))........................................................30</p><p class="depth0">Step 7--Compute adjusted net insurance income:  (20) Adjusted net insurance income.....................................0</p><p class="depth0">Step 8--Additions to or reduction of adjusted net foreign base company</p><p class="depth0">income by reason of section 952(c):  (21) Earnings and profits for the current year.......................350 (22) The excess in earnings and profits over subpart F income, which is  subject to being recharacterized as adjusted net foreign base company  income under section 952(c)(2) (excess of line (21) over the sum of line  (19) and line (20));

The net foreign  base   company income of a controlled foreign corporation is computed by  reducing (but not below zero) the amount of gross income in each of the  categories of adjusted gross foreign base company income described in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, so as to take into account deductions  allocable and apportionable to such income. For purposes of section 954  and this section, expenses must be allocated and apportioned consistent  with the allocation and apportionment of expenses for purposes of  section 904(d). For purposes of this Sec. 1.954-1T, an item of net  foreign base company income must be categorized according to the  category of adjusted gross foreign base company income from which it is  derived. Thus, an item of net foreign base company income must be  categorized as a net item of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Foreign personal holding company income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign base company sales income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign base company services income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign base company shipping income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Foreign base company oil related income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Full inclusion foreign base company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Computation of adjusted net foreign base company income or  adjusted net insurance income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application of high tax exception.  Adjusted net foreign base company income (or adjusted net insurance  income) equals the net foreign base company income (or net insurance  income) of a controlled foreign corporation, reduced by any item of such  income (other than foreign base company oil related income as defined in  section 954(g)) subject to the high tax exception provided by section  954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d). An item of income is subject to the  high tax exception only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is established that the income was subject to creditable  income taxes imposed by a foreign country or countries at an effective  rate that is greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of tax  specified in section 11 or 15 for the taxable year of the controlled  foreign corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election is made under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph  (d)(5) of this section to exclude the income from the computation of  subpart F income.  See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for the definition of the term  ``item of income.'' For rules concerning the treatment for foreign tax  credit purposes of amounts excluded from subpart F under section  954(b)(4), see Sec. 904-1.4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective rate at which taxes are imposed. For purposes of this  paragraph (d), the effective rate at which taxes are imposed on an item  of income is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of income taxes paid or accrued (or deemed paid or  accrued) with respect to the item of income, determined under paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, divided by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The item of net foreign base company income or net insurance  income, determined under paragraph (d)(4) of this section (including the  appropriate amount of income taxes referred to in subdivision (i) of  this paragraph (d)(2), immediately above).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Income other than passive foreign personal holding company income. The  amount of income taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of income  (other than an item of foreign personal holding company income that is  passive income) for purposes of section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d)  is the amount of foreign income taxes that would be deemed paid under  section 960 with respect to that item if that item were included in the  gross income of a U.S. shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A). For this  purpose, the amounts that would be deemed paid under section 960 shall  be determined separately with respect to each controlled foreign  corporation and without regard to the limitation applicable under  section 904(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Passive foreign personal holding company income. The amount of  income taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of foreign personal  holding company income that is passive income for purposes of section  954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d) is the amount of foreign income taxes  paid or accrued or deemed paid by the foreign corporation that would be  taken into account for purposes of applying the provisions of Sec.  1.904-4(c) with respect to that item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Item of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income other than passive foreign personal  holding company income. The high tax exception applies (when elected) to  all income that constitutes a single item under this paragraph (d)(4). A  single item of net foreign base company income or net insurance income  is an amount of net foreign base company income (other than foreign  personal holding company income that is passive income) or net insurance  income that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Falls within a single category of net foreign base company  income, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, or net insurance  income, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Also falls within a single separate limitation category for  purposes of sections 904(d) and 960 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Passive foreign personal holding company income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. For purposes of this paragraph (d) a single item of net foreign  personal holding company income that is passive income is an amount of  such income that falls within a single group of passive income under the  grouping rules of Sec. 1.904-4(c) (3), (4), and (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consistency rule. An election to exclude income from subpart F  must be consistently made with respect to all items of passive foreign  personal holding company income eligible to be excluded. Thus, high- taxed passive foreign personal holding company income of a controlled  foreign corporation must be excluded in its entirety, or remain subject  to subpart F.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Procedure. The election provided by this paragraph (d) must be  made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By controlling United States shareholders, as defined in Sec.  1.964-1(c)(5), by attaching a statement to such effect with their  original or amended income tax returns, and including any additional  information required by subsequent administrative pronouncements, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In such other manner as may be prescribed in subsequent  administrative pronouncements.  An election made under the procedure provided by this paragraph (d)(5)  is binding on all United States shareholders of the controlled foreign  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Illustrations. The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated  by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items of income. During its 1987 taxable year,  controlled foreign corporation CFC receives from outside its country of  operation portfolio dividend income of $100 and interest income of $100  (consisting of a gross payment of $150 reduced by a third-country  withholding tax of $50). For purposes of illustration, assume that the  CFC incurs no expenses. None of the income is taxed in CFC's country of  operation. The dividend income was not subject to their-country  withholding taxes. The interest income was subject to withholding taxes  equal to $50, and is therefore high withholding tax interest for  purposes of section 960 (pursuant to the operation of section 904). The  dividend income is passive income for purposes of section 960.  Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, CFC has two  items of income: (1) $100 of FPHC/passive income (the dividends) and (2)  $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax income (the interest). The election  under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude high-taxed income from  the operation of subpart F is potentially applicable to each such item  in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective rates of tax. No foreign tax would be deemed paid  under section 960 with respect to item (1). Therefore, the effective  rate of foreign tax is 0, and the item may not be excluded from subpart  F under the rules of this paragraph (d). Foreign tax of $50 would be  deemed paid under section 960 with respect to item (2). Therefore, the  effective rate of foreign tax is 33 percent ($50 of creditable taxes  paid, divided by $150, consisting of the item of net foreign base  company income ($100) plus creditable taxes paid thereon ($50). The  highest rate of tax specified in section 11 for the 1987 taxable year is  34 percent. Accordingly, item (2) may be excluded from subpart F  pursuant to an election under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, since it  is subject to foreign tax at an effective rate that is greater than 30.6  percent (90 percent of 34 percent). However, it remains high withholding  tax interest when included.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that CFC's  country of operation imposes a tax of $50 with respect to CFC's dividend  income. The interest income is still high withholding tax interest. The  dividend income is still passive income (without regard to the possible  applicability of the high tax exception of section 904(d)(2)).  Accordingly, CFC has two items of income for purposes of this paragraph  (d): (1) $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax interest income, and (2) $50  of FPHC/passive income (net of the $50 foreign tax). Both items are  taxed at an effective rate greater than 31.6 percent. Item 1: Foreign  tax ($50) divided by sum ($150) of income item ($100) plus creditable   tax thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Item 2: Foreign tax ($50) divided  by sum ($100) of income item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50)  equals 50 percent. Accordingly, an election may be made under paragraph  (d)(5) of this section to exclude either, both, or neither of items 1  and 2 from subpart F.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  $100 of portfolio dividend income is subject to a third-country  withholding tax of $50, and the $150 of interest income is from sources  within CFC's country of operation, is subject to a $10 income tax  therein, and is not subject to a withholding tax. Although the interest  income and the dividend income are both passive income, under paragraph  (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section they constitute separate items of income  pursuant to the application of the grouping rules of Sec. 1.904-4(c).  Accordingly, CFC has two items of income for purposes of this paragraph  (d): (1) $50 (net of tax) of FPHC/non-country of operation/greater than  15 percent withholding tax income; and (2) $140 (net of $10 tax) of  FPHC/country of operation income. Item 1 is taxed at an effective rate  greater than 30.6 percent, but Item 2 is not. Item 1: Foreign tax ($50)  divided by sum ($100) of income item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon  ($50) equals 50 percent. Item 2: Foreign tax ($10) divided by sum ($150)  of income item ($140) plus creditable tax thereon ($10) equals 6.67  percent. Therefore, an election may be made under paragraph (d)(5) of  this section to exclude Item 1 but not Item 2 from subpart F.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the  $150 of interest income is subject to an income tax of $50 in CFC's  country of operation. Accordingly, CFC has two items of income, as in  Example 4, but both items are taxed at an effective rate greater than  30.6 percent. Item 1: Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of income  item ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. Item 2:  Foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($150) if income item ($100) plus  creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Pursuant to the  consistency rule of paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, CFC's  shareholders must consistently elect or not elect to exclude from  subpart F all items of FPHC income that are eligible to be excluded.  Therefore, an election may be made to exclude both Item 1 and Item 2  from subpart F, or neither may be excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Character of an item of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substance of the  transaction. For purposes of section 954 and the regulations thereunder,  items of income shall be characterized in accordance with the substance  of the transaction, and not in accordance with the designation applied  by the parties to the transaction. For example, an amount received as  ``rent'' which actually constitutes income from the sale of property,  royalties, or income from services shall not be characterized as  ``rent'' but shall be characterized as income from the sale of property,  royalties or income from services, respectively. Local law shall not be  controlling in characterizing an item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section. For example, if a controlled foreign  corporation, in its business of purchasing and selling personal  property, receives interest (including imputed interest and market  discount) on an account receivable arising from a sale, a portion of the  income derived from the transaction by the controlled foreign  corporation will be interest, and another portion will be gain (or loss)  from the sale of personal property. If the sale is denominated in a  currency other than a functional currency as defined in section 985 and  the regulations thereunder, the controlled foreign corporation may have  additional income in the form of foreign currency gain as defined in  section 988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Predominant character. The portion of income derived from a  transaction that meets the definition of foreign personal holding  company income is always separately determinable, and thus must always  be segregated from other income and separately classified under  paragraph (2) of this paragraph (e). However, the portion of income  derived from a transaction that would meet a particular definitional  provision under section 954 or 953 and the regulations thereunder (other  than the definition of foreign personal holding company income) in  unusual circumstances may be indeterminable. If such portion is  indeterminable, it must be classified in accordance with the predominant  character of the transaction. For example, if a controlled foreign  corporation engineers, fabricates, and installs a fixed offshore   drilling platform as part of an integrated transaction, and the portion  of income that relates to services is not accounted for separately from  the portion that relates to sales, and is otherwise indeterminable, then  the classification of income from the transaction shall be made in  accordance with the predominant character of the particular integrated  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination of categories of gross foreign base company income  or gross insurance income. The definitions of gross foreign base company  income and gross insurance income are limited by the following rules (to  be applied in numerical order):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an item of income is included in subpart F income under  section 952(a)(1) and the regulations thereunder as insurance income, it  is by definition excluded from any other category of subpart F income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an item of income is included in the foreign base company  oil related income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by  definition excluded from any other category of foreign base company  income, other than as provided in subdivision (i) of this paragraph  (e)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an item of income is included in the foreign base company  shipping income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by definition  excluded from any other category of foreign base company income, other  than as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (e)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If an item of income is included in foreign personal holding  company income of a controlled foreign corporation, it is by definition  not included in any other category of foreign base company income, other  than as provided in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph  (e)(4).  An item of income shall not be excluded from the definition of a  category of gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income  under this paragraph (e)(4) by reason of being included in the general  definition of another category of gross foreign base company income or  gross insurance income, if the item of income is excluded from that  other category by a more specific provision of section 953 or 954 and  the regulations thereunder. For example, income derived from a commodity  transaction that is excluded from foreign personal holding company  income under Sec. 1.954-2T(f) as income from qualified active sales may  be included in gross foreign base company income if it also meets the  definition of foreign base company sales income. See Sec. 1.954- 2T(a)(2) for the coordination of overlapping categories within the  definition of foreign personal holding company income.  [T.D. 8216, 53 FR 27492, July 21, 1988.
