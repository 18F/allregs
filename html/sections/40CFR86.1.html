Sec. 86.004-2  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">The definitions of Sec. 86.001-2 continue to apply to 2001 and later model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply beginning with the 2004 model year.</p><p class="depth0">Ambulance has the meaning given in Sec. 86.1803.</p><p class="depth0">Defeat device means an auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such conditions are substantially included in the applicable Federal emission test procedure for heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines described in subpart N of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The need for the AECD is justified in terms of protecting the vehicle against damage or accident;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The AECD does not go beyond the requirements of engine starting; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The AECD applies only for engines that will be installed in emergency vehicles, and the need is justified in terms of preventing the engine from losing speed, torque, or power due abnormal

conditions of the emission control system, or in terms of preventing such abnormal conditions from occurring, during operation related to emergency response. Examples of such abnormal conditions may include excessive exhaust backpressure from an overloaded particulate trap, and running out of diesel exhaust fluid for engines that rely on urea-based selective catalytic reduction.</p><p class="depth0">Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) means a liquid reducing agent (other than the engine fuel) used in conjunction with selective catalytic reduction to reduce NOX emissions. Diesel exhaust fluid is generally understood to be an aqueous solution of urea conforming to the specifications of ISO 22241.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency vehicle means a vehicle that meets one of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is an ambulance or a fire truck.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is a vehicle that we have determined will likely be used in emergency situations where emission control function or malfunction may cause a significant risk to human life. For example, we would consider a pickup truck that is certain to be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module to become an emergency vehicle, even though it was not initially designed to be a fire truck. Also, a mobile command center that is unable to manually regenerate its DPF while on duty could be an emergency vehicle. In making this determination, we may consider any factor that has an effect on the totality of the actual risk to human life. For example, we may consider how frequently a vehicle will be used in emergency situations or how likely it is that the emission controls will cause a significant risk to human life when the vehicle is used in emergency situations. We would not consider the pickup truck in the example above to be an emergency vehicle if there is merely a possibility (rather than a certainty) that the vehicle will be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module.</p><p class="depth0">Fire truck has the meaning given in Sec. 86.1803.</p><p class="depth0">U.S.-directed production means the engines and/or vehicles (as applicable) produced by a manufacturer for which the manufacturer has reasonable assurance that sale was or will be made to ultimate purchasers in the United States, excluding engines and/or vehicles that are certified to state emission standards different than the emission standards in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Useful life means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For light-duty vehicles, and for light light-duty trucks not subject to the Tier 0 standards of Sec. 86.094-9(a), intermediate useful life and/or full useful life.

This petition must include full rationale behind the request together with any supporting data or other evidence. Based on this or other information the Administration may allow for an alternative procedure. Any petition should be submitted in a timely manner, to allow

adequate time for a thorough evaluation. Manufacturers using an additive deterioration factor under this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A)(3) must perform in-use verification testing to determine if the additive deterioration factor reasonably predicts actual in-use emissions. The plan for the in-use verification testing must be approved by the Administrator as part of the approval process described in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(4)(A)(3) prior to the use of the additive deterioration factor.

Except as specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, use an additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive deterioration factor for a pollutant is the difference between exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by adding the factor to the measured emissions. If the factor is less than zero, use zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one more decimal place than the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. Use a multiplicative deterioration factor if good engineering judgment calls for the deterioration factor for a pollutant to be the ratio of exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life to exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. For example, if you use aftertreatment technology that controls emissions of a pollutant proportionally to engine-out emissions, it is often appropriate to use a multiplicative deterioration factor. Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. If the factor is less than one, use one. A multiplicative deterioration factor may not be appropriate in cases where testing variability is significantly greater than engine-to-engine variability.

If your engine family includes engines with one or more AECDs for emergency vehicle applications approved under paragraph (4) of the definition of defeat device, do not consider additional regenerations resulting from those AECDs when calculating emission factors or frequencies under this paragraph (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Development of adjustment factors. Manufacturers must develop separate pairs of adjustment factors (an upward adjustment factor and a downward adjustment factor) for each pollutant based on measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency. Adjustment factors may be carried-over to subsequent model years or carried-across to other engine families only where the Administrator determines that such carry-over or carry-across is consistent with good engineering judgment. Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but manufacturers may develop separate adjustment factors for different engine configurations within an engine family. All adjustment factors for regeneration are additive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculation of adjustment factors. The adjustment factors are calculated from the following parameters: the measured emissions from a test in which the regeneration occurs (EFH), the measured emissions from a test in which the regeneration does not occur (EFL), and the frequency of the regeneration event in terms of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs (F). The average emission rate (EFA) is calculated as:
EFA = (F)(EFH) + (1 - F)(EFL)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The upward adjustment factor (UAF) is calculated as: UAF = EFA - EFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The downward adjustment factor (DAF) is calculated as: DAF = EFA - EFH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of adjustment factors. Upward adjustment factors are added to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration does not occur. Downward adjustment factors are added to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration occurs. The occurrence of the regeneration must be identified in a manner that is readily apparent during all testing. Where no regeneration is identified, the upward adjustment factor shall be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sample calculation. If EFL is 0.10 g/bhp-hr, EFH is 0.50 g/bhp-hr, and F is 0.1 (i.e., the regeneration occurs once for each ten tests), then:
EFA = (0.1)(0.5 g/bhp-hr) + (1.0 - 0.1)(0.1 g/bhp-hr) = 0.14 g/bhp-hrUAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.10 g/bhp-hr = 0.04 g/bhp-hrDAF = 0.14 g/bhp-hr - 0.50 g/bhp-hr = -0.36 g/bhp-hr</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Options. (i) A manufacturer may elect to omit adjustment factors for one or more of its engine families (or configurations) because the effect of the regeneration is small, or because it is not practical to identify when regenerations occur. In these cases, no upward or downward adjustment factor shall be added, and the manufacturer is liable for compliance with the emission standards for all tests, without regard to whether a regeneration occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator may account for regeneration events differently than is provided in this paragraph (i). However, this option only applies for events that occur extremely infrequently, and which cannot be practically addressed using the adjustment factors described in this paragraph (i).

Sec. 86.010-18  On-board Diagnostics for engines used in applications greater than 14,000 pounds GVWR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. According to the implementation schedule shown in paragraph (o) of this section, heavy-duty engines intended for use in a heavy-duty vehicle weighing more than 14,000 pounds GVWR must be equipped with an on-board diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring all emission-related engine systems or components during the life of the engine. The OBD system is required to detect all malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this Sec. 86.010-18 although the OBD system is not required to use a unique monitor to detect each of those malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the OBD system detects a malfunction, it must store a pending, a MIL-on, or a previous-MIL-on diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in the onboard computer's memory. A malfunction indicator light (MIL) must also be activated as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data link connector.

This requirement does not alter existing law and enforcement practice regarding a manufacturer's liability for an engine beyond its regulatory useful life, except where an engine has been programmed or otherwise designed so that an OBD system deactivates based on age and/or mileage of the engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Drive cycle or driving cycle, in the context of this Sec. 86.010-18, means operation that meets any of the conditions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Further, for OBD monitors that run during engine-off conditions, the period of engine-off time following engine shutoff and up to the next engine start may be considered part of the drive cycle for the conditions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(iv) of this section. For engines/vehicles that employ engine shutoff OBD monitoring strategies that do not require the vehicle operator to restart the engine to continue vehicle operation (e.g., a hybrid bus with engine shutoff at idle), the manufacturer may use an alternative definition for drive cycle (e.g., key-on followed by key-off). Any alternative definition must be based on equivalence to engine startup and engine shutoff signaling the beginning and ending of a single driving event for a conventional vehicle. For engines that are not likely to be routinely operated for long continuous periods of time, a manufacturer may also request approval to use an alternative definition for drive cycle (e.g., solely based on engine start and engine shutoff without regard to four hours of continuous engine-on time). Administrator approval of the alternative definition will be based on manufacturer-submitted data and/or information demonstrating the typical usage, operating habits, and/or driving patterns of these vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begins with engine start and ends with engine shutoff;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Begins with engine start and ends after four hours of continuous engine-on operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Begins at the end of the previous four hours of continuous engine-on operation and ends after four hours of continuous engine-on operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Begins at the end of the previous four hours of continuous engine-on operation and ends with engine shutoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> As an alternative to demonstrating compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (l) of this Sec. 86.010-18, a manufacturer may demonstrate how the OBD system they have designed to comply with California OBD requirements for engines used in applications greater than 14,000 pounds also complies with the intent of the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section. To make use

of this alternative, the manufacturer must demonstrate to the Administrator how the OBD system they intend to certify meets the intent behind all of the requirements of this section, where applicable (e.g., paragraph (h) of this section would not apply for a diesel fueled/CI engine). Furthermore, if making use of this alternative, the manufacturer must comply with the specific certification documentation requirements of paragraph (m)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Temporary provisions to address hardship due to unusual circumstances. (i) After considering the unusual circumstances, the Administrator may permit the manufacturer to introduce into U.S. commerce engines that do not comply with this Sec. 86.010-18 for a limited time if all the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Unusual circumstances that are clearly outside the manufacturer's control prevent compliance with the requirements of this Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No other allowances are available under the regulations in this chapter to avoid the impending violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To apply for an exemption, the manufacturer must send to the Administrator a written request as soon as possible before being in violation. In the request, the manufacturer must show that all the conditions and requirements of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The request must also include a plan showing how all the applicable requirements will be met as quickly as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer shall give the Administrator other relevant information upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Administrator may include additional conditions on an approval granted under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(6), including provisions that may require field repair at the manufacturer's expense to correct the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Engines sold as non-compliant under this temporary hardship provision must display ``non-OBD'' in the data stream as required under paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section. Upon correcting the noncompliance, the data stream value must be updated accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Malfunction indicator light (MIL) and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC). The OBD system must incorporate a malfunction indicator light (MIL) or equivalent and must store specific types of diagnostic trouble codes (DTC). Unless otherwise specified, all provisions of this paragraph (b) apply for 2010 and later model years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> MIL specifications. (i) For model years 2013 and later, the MIL must be located on the primary driver's side instrument panel and be of sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions. The MIL must be amber (yellow) in color; the use of red for the OBD-related MIL is prohibited. More than one general purpose malfunction indicator light for emission-related problems shall not be used; separate specific purpose warning lights (e.g., brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. When activated, the MIL shall display the International Standards Organization (ISO) engine symbol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The OBD system must activate the MIL when the ignition is in the key-on/engine-off position before engine cranking to indicate that the MIL is functional. The MIL shall be activated continuously during this functional check for a minimum of 5 seconds. During this MIL key-on functional check, the data stream value (see paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section) for MIL status must indicate ``commanded off'' unless the OBD system has detected a malfunction and has stored a MIL-on DTC. This MIL key-on functional check is not required during vehicle operation in the key-on/engine-off position subsequent to the initial engine cranking of an ignition cycle (e.g., due to an engine stall or other non-commanded engine shutoff).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an option, the MIL may be used to indicate readiness status (see paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section) in a standardized format in the key-on/engine-off position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer may also use the MIL to indicate which, if any, DTCs are currently stored (e.g., to ``blink''

the stored DTCs). Such use must not activate unintentionally during routine driver operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For model years 2013 and later, the MIL required by this paragraph (b) must not be used in any other way than is specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage protocol. (i) Within 10 seconds of detecting a potential malfunction, the OBD system must store a pending DTC that identifies the potential malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the potential malfunction is again detected before the end of the next drive cycle during which monitoring occurs (i.e., the potential malfunction has been confirmed as a malfunction), then within 10 seconds of such detection the OBD system must activate the MIL continuously and store a MIL-on DTC (systems using the SAE J1939 standard protocol specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may either erase or retain the pending DTC in conjunction with storing the MIL-on DTC). If the potential malfunction is not detected before the end of the next drive cycle during which monitoring occurs (i.e., there is no indication of the malfunction at any time during the drive cycle), the corresponding pending DTC should be erased at the end of the drive cycle. Similarly, if a malfunction is detected for the first time and confirmed on a given drive cycle without need for further evaluation, then within 10 seconds of such detection the OBD system must activate the MIL continuously and store a MIL-on DTC (again, systems using the SAE J1939 standard protocol specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may optionally store a pending DTC in conjunction with storing the MIL-on DTC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A manufacturer may request Administrator approval to employ alternative statistical MIL activation and DTC storage protocols to those specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Approval will depend upon the manufacturer providing data and/or engineering evaluations that demonstrate that the alternative protocols can evaluate system performance and detect malfunctions in a manner that is equally effective and timely. Strategies requiring on average more than six drive cycles for MIL activation will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The OBD system must store a ``freeze frame'' of the operating conditions (as defined in paragraph (k)(4)(iii) of this section) present upon detecting a malfunction or a potential malfunction. In the event that a pending DTC has matured to a MIL-on DTC, the manufacturer shall either retain the currently stored freeze frame conditions or replace the stored freeze frame with freeze frame conditions regarding the MIL-on DTC. Any freeze frame stored in conjunction with any pending DTC or MIL-on DTC should be erased upon erasure of the corresponding DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the engine enters a limp-home mode of operation that can affect emissions or the performance of the OBD system, or in the event of a malfunction of an onboard computer(s) itself that can affect the performance of the OBD system, the OBD system must activate the MIL and store a MIL-on DTC within 10 seconds to inform the vehicle operator. If the limp-home mode of operation is recoverable (i.e., operation automatically returns to normal at the beginning of the following ignition cycle), the OBD system may wait to activate the MIL and store the MIL-on DTC if the limp-home mode of operation is again entered before the end of the next ignition cycle rather than activating the MIL within 10 seconds on the first drive cycle during which the limp-home mode of operation is entered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Before the end of an ignition cycle, the OBD system must store a permanent DTC(s) that corresponds to any stored MIL-on DTC(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> MIL deactivation and DTC erasure protocol--(i) Deactivating the MIL. Except as otherwise provided for in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(E) and (g)(6)(iv)(B) of this section for diesel misfire malfunctions and empty reductant tanks, and paragraphs (h)(1)(iv)(F), (h)(2)(viii), and (h)(7)(iv)(B) of this section for gasoline fuel system, misfire, and evaporative system malfunctions, once the MIL has been activated, it may be deactivated after three subsequent sequential drive cycles during which the monitoring system responsible for activating the MIL functions and the previously detected malfunction is no longer present and provided no other malfunction has

been detected that would independently activate the MIL according to the requirements outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Erasing a MIL-on DTC. The OBD system may erase a MIL-on DTC if the identified malfunction has not again been detected in at least 40 engine warm up cycles and the MIL is presently not activated for that malfunction. The OBD system may also erase a MIL-on DTC upon deactivating the MIL according to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section provided a previous-MIL-on DTC is stored upon erasure of the MIL-on DTC. The OBD system may erase a previous-MIL-on DTC if the identified malfunction has not again been detected in at least 40 engine warm up cycles and the MIL is presently not activated for that malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Erasing a permanent DTC. The OBD system can erase a permanent DTC only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The OBD system itself determines that the malfunction that caused the corresponding permanent DTC to be stored is no longer present and is not commanding activation of the MIL, concurrent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section which, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), shall apply to all monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle if the monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction of the component or the system is not present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is not subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle provided the following two criteria have independently been satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction is no longer present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monitor does not detect a malfunction on a drive cycle and the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section has been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These two separate criteria may be met on the same or different drive cycles provided the monitor never detects a malfunction during either drive cycle, and if criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) happens first then no malfunction may be detected before criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) occurs. If a malfunction occurs after criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) then criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) must be satisfied again. For the second criterion, the manufacturer must exclude any temperature and/or elevation provisions of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. For this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C), monitors required to use ``similar conditions'' as defined in Sec. 86.010-2 to store and erase pending and MIL-on DTCs cannot require that the similar conditions be met prior to erasure of the permanent DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The Administrator shall allow monitors subject to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to use the criteria of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section in lieu of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B). Further, manufacturers may request Administrator approval to use alternative criteria to erase the permanent DTC. The Administrator shall approve alternate criteria that will not likely require driving conditions that are longer and more difficult to meet than those required under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and do not require access to enhanced scan tools to determine conditions necessary to erase the permanent DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions to MIL and DTC requirements. (i) If a limp-home mode of operation causes a overt indication (e.g.,

activation of a red engine shut-down warning light) such that the driver is certain to respond and have the problem corrected, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL as required by paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. Additionally, if an auxiliary emission control device has been properly activated as approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For gasoline engines, a manufacturer may choose to meet the MIL and DTC requirements in Sec. 86.007-17 in lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Monitoring conditions. The OBD system must monitor and detect the malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section under the following general monitoring conditions. The more specific monitoring conditions of paragraph (d) of this section are sometimes required according to the provisions of paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As specifically provided for in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions must be technically necessary to ensure robust detection of malfunctions (e.g., avoid false passes and false indications of malfunctions); designed to ensure monitoring will occur under conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and normal vehicle use; and, designed to ensure monitoring will occur during the FTP transient test cycle contained in appendix I paragraph (f), of this part, or similar drive cycle as approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring must occur at least once per drive cycle in which the monitoring conditions are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers may define monitoring conditions that are not encountered during the FTP cycle as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In doing so, the manufacturer would be expected to consider the degree to which the requirement to run during the FTP transient cycle restricts monitoring during in-use operation, the technical necessity for defining monitoring conditions that are not encountered during the FTP cycle, whether monitoring is otherwise not feasible during the FTP cycle, and/or the ability to demonstrate that the monitoring conditions satisfy the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance ratio requirement as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In-use performance tracking. As specifically required in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the OBD system must monitor and detect the malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section according to the criteria of this paragraph (d). The OBD system is not required to track and report in-use performance for monitors other than those specifically identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but all monitors on applicable model year engines are still required to meet the in-use performance ratio as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must implement software algorithms in the OBD system to individually track and report the in-use performance of the following monitors, if equipped, in the standardized format specified in paragraph (e) of this section: NMHC converting catalyst (paragraph (g)(5) of this section); NOX converting catalyst (paragraph (g)(6) of this section); gasoline catalyst (paragraph (h)(6) of this section); exhaust gas sensor (paragraph (g)(9) of this section) or paragraph (h)(8) of this section); evaporative system (paragraph (h)(7) of this section); EGR system (paragraph (g)(3) of this section or (h)(3) of this section); VVT system (paragraph (g)(10) of this section or (h)(9) of this section); secondary air system (paragraph (h)(5) of this section); DPF system (paragraph (g)(8) of this section); boost pressure control system (paragraph (g)(4) of this section); and, NOX adsorber system (paragraph (g)(7) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer shall not use the calculated ratio specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or any other indication of monitor frequency as a monitoring condition for a monitor (e.g., using a low ratio to enable more frequent monitoring through diagnostic executive priority or modification of other monitoring conditions, or using a high ratio to enable less frequent monitoring).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For model years 2013 and later, manufacturers must define monitoring conditions that, in addition to meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section, ensure that the monitor yields an in-use performance ratio (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) that meets or exceeds the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance ratio of 0.100 for all monitors specifically required in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section to meet the monitoring condition requirements of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the most reliable monitoring method developed requires a lower ratio for a specific monitor than that specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Administrator may lower the minimum acceptable in-use monitoring performance ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In-use performance ratio definition. For monitors required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the performance ratio must be calculated in accordance with the specifications of this paragraph (d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of the performance ratio is defined as the number of times a vehicle has been operated such that all monitoring conditions have been encountered that are necessary for the specific monitor to detect a malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator is defined as the number of times a vehicle has been operated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The performance ratio is defined as the numerator divided by the denominator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifications for incrementing the numerator. (i) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section, the numerator, when incremented, must be incremented by an integer of one. The numerator shall not be incremented more than once per drive cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The numerator for a specific monitor must be incremented within 10 seconds if and only if the following criteria are satisfied on a single drive cycle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Every monitoring condition has been satisfied that is necessary for the specific monitor to detect a malfunction and store a pending DTC, including applicable enable criteria, presence or absence of related DTCs, sufficient length of monitoring time, and diagnostic executive priority assignments (e.g., diagnostic ``A'' must execute prior to diagnostic ``B''). For the purpose of incrementing the numerator, satisfying all the monitoring conditions necessary for a monitor to determine that the monitor is not malfunctioning shall not, by itself, be sufficient to meet this criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For monitors that require multiple stages or events in a single drive cycle to detect a malfunction, every monitoring condition necessary for all events to complete must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For monitors that require intrusive operation of components to detect a malfunction, a manufacturer must request approval of the strategy used to determine that, had a malfunction been present, the monitor would have detected the malfunction. Administrator approval of the request will be based on the equivalence of the strategy to actual intrusive operation and the ability of the strategy to determine accurately if every monitoring condition was satisfied that was necessary for the intrusive event to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For the secondary air system monitor, the criteria in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section are satisfied during normal operation of the secondary air system.

When necessary, the Administrator will consider data and/or engineering analyses submitted by the manufacturer demonstrating the expected frequency of results in the ``non-detection zone'' and the ability of the monitor to determine accurately, had an actual malfunction

been present, whether or not the monitor would have detected a malfunction instead of a result in the ``non-detection zone.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For monitors that run or complete their evaluation with the engine off, the numerator must be incremented either within 10 seconds of the monitor completing its evaluation in the engine off state, or during the first 10 seconds of engine start on the subsequent drive cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Manufacturers that use alternative statistical MIL activation protocols as allowed in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section for any of the monitors requiring a numerator, are required to increment the numerator(s) appropriately. The manufacturer may be required to provide supporting data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating both the equivalence of their incrementing approach to the incrementing specified in this paragraph (d)(3) for monitors using the standard MIL activation protocol, and the overall equivalence of the incrementing approach in determining that the minimum acceptable in-use performance ratio of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if applicable, has been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Specifications for incrementing the denominator.

The OBD system must monitor the fuel delivery system to verify that it is functioning properly. The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors, pumps) that are used in the fuel system and are not specifically addressed in this paragraph (g)(1) must be monitored in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel system malfunction criteria--(A) Fuel system pressure control. The OBD system must monitor the fuel system's ability to control to the desired fuel pressure. This monitoring must be done continuously unless new hardware

has to be added, in which case the monitoring must be done at least once per drive cycle. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel system's pressure control system when the pressure control system is unable to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel system pressure control could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the commanded fuel system pressure cannot be delivered. For model year 2010 to 2012 engines with a unit injector fuel system, this requirement may be met by conducting a functional check of the fuel system pressure control in lieu of monitoring for conditions that could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fuel system injection quantity. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel injection system when the system is unable to deliver the commanded quantity of fuel necessary to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel injection quantity could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the commanded fuel quantity cannot be delivered. For model year 2010 to 2012 engines with a unit injector fuel system, this requirement may be met by conducting a functional check of the fuel system injection quantity in lieu of monitoring for conditions that could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Fuel system injection timing. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel injection system when the system is unable to deliver fuel at the proper crank angle/timing (e.g., injection timing too advanced or too retarded) necessary to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel injection timing could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the commanded fuel injection timing cannot be achieved. For model year 2010 to 2012 engines with a unit injector fuel system, this requirement may be met by conducting a functional check of the fuel system injection timing in lieu of monitoring for conditions that could cause an engine's emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Combined Monitoring. For engines with a unit injector fuel system, the manufacturer may request Administrator approval to combine the malfunction criteria of paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) through (g)(1)(ii)(C) of this section into one malfunction provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that the combined malfunction will satisfy the intent of each separate malfunction criteria. For engines with a common rail fuel system, the manufacturer may request Administrator approval to combine the malfunction criteria of paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(B) through (g)(1)(ii)(C) of this section into one malfunction provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that the combined malfunction will satisfy the intent of each separate malfunction criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Fuel system feedback control. See paragraph (i)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fuel system monitoring conditions. (A) With the exceptions noted in this paragraph for unit injector systems, the OBD system must monitor continuously for malfunctions identified in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(A) and (g)(1)(ii)(E) of this section. For 2010 through 2012 unit injector systems, where functional monitoring is done in lieu of emission threshold monitoring for malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For 2013 and later unit injector systems, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for

malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that monitoring must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For 2010 through 2012, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii)(B), (g)(1)(ii)(C), and (g)(1)(ii)(D) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For 2013 and later, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that monitoring must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fuel system MIL activation and DTC storage. The MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engine misfire monitoring--(i) General. The OBD system must monitor the engine for misfire causing excess emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Engine misfire malfunction criteria. (A) The OBD system must be capable of detecting misfire occurring in one or more cylinders. To the extent possible without adding hardware for this specific purpose, the OBD system must also identify the specific misfiring cylinder. If more than one cylinder is misfiring continuously, or if more than one but less than half of the cylinders are misfiring continuously (if the manufacturer can demonstrate the robustness of their monitor to the approval of the Administrator), a separate DTC must be stored indicating that multiple cylinders are misfiring. When identifying multiple cylinder misfire, the OBD system is not required to identify individually through separate DTCs each of the continuously misfiring cylinders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality (e.g., for use in engines with homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) control systems), the OBD system must detect a misfire malfunction causing emissions to exceed the applicable thresholds for ``other monitors'' shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). To determine what level of misfire would cause emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds, the manufacturer must determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 1,000 revolution increments that would cause emissions from an emission durability demonstration engine to exceed the emissions thresholds if the percentage of misfire were present from the beginning of the test. To establish this percentage of misfire, the manufacturer must use misfire events occurring at equally spaced, complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly selected cylinders throughout each 1,000-revolution increment. If this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than one percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at one percent. Any misfire malfunction must be detected if the percentage of misfire established via this testing is exceeded regardless of the pattern of misfire events (e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous). The manufacturer may employ other revolution increments besides the 1,000 revolution increment. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the strategy is equally effective and timely in detecting misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine misfire monitoring conditions. (A) The OBD system must monitor for engine misfire during engine idle conditions at least once per drive cycle in which the monitoring conditions for misfire are met. The manufacturer must be able to demonstrate via engineering analysis and/or data that the self-defined monitoring conditions: are technically necessary to ensure robust detection of malfunctions (e.g., avoid false passes and false detection of malfunctions); require no more than 1000 cumulative engine revolutions; and, do not require any single continuous idle operation of more than 15 seconds to make a determination that a malfunction is present (e.g., a decision can be made with data gathered during several idle operations of 15 seconds or less); or, satisfy the requirements of

paragraph (c) of this section with alternative engine operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Manufacturers may employ alternative monitoring conditions (e.g., off-idle) provided the manufacturer is able to demonstrate that the alternative monitoring ensure equivalent robust detection of malfunctions and equivalent timeliness in detection of malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality the OBD system must monitor continuously for engine misfire under all positive torque engine speed and load conditions. If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator approve the monitoring system nonetheless. In evaluating the manufacturer's request, the Administrator will consider the following factors: the magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be based on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and, paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Engine misfire MIL activation and DTC storage. (A) General requirements for MIL activation and DTC storage are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, upon detection of the percentage of misfire specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the following criteria shall apply for MIL activation and DTC storage: A pending DTC must be stored no later than after the fourth exceedance of the percentage of misfire specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section during a single drive cycle; if a pending fault code has been stored, the OBD system must activate the MIL and store a MIL-on DTC within 10 seconds if the percentage of misfire specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section is again exceeded four times during the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC, regardless of the conditions encountered during the drive cycle, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that were occurring when the pending DTC was stored. Similar conditions means an engine speed within 375 rpm, engine load within 20 percent, and the same warm up status (i.e., cold or hot). The Administrator may approve other definitions of similar conditions based on comparable timeliness and reliability in detecting similar engine operation. The pending DTC may be erased at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that were occurring when the pending DTC was stored provided the specified percentage of misfire was not again exceeded. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the 80 drive cycles immediately following initial detection of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, the OBD system must store and erase freeze frame conditions either in conjunction with storing and erasing a pending DTC or in conjunction with storing and erasing a MIL-on DTC. If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than a misfire malfunction when a DTC is stored as specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the stored freeze frame information must be replaced with the freeze frame information regarding the misfire malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, upon detection of misfire according to paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the OBD system must also store the following engine conditions:

engine speed, load, and warm up status of the first misfire event that resulted in the storage of the pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For model years 2013 and later, on engines equipped with sensors that can detect combustion or combustion quality, the MIL may be deactivated after three sequential drive cycles in which similar conditions have been encountered without an exceedance of the specified percentage of misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EGR system monitoring--(i) General. The OBD system must monitor the EGR system on engines so equipped for low flow rate, high flow rate, and slow response malfunctions. For engines equipped with EGR coolers (e.g., heat exchangers), the OBD system must monitor the cooler for insufficient cooling malfunctions. The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors) that are used in the EGR system must be monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component requirements in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> EGR system malfunction criteria--(A) EGR low flow. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes a decrease in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot increase EGR flow to achieve the commanded flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> EGR high flow. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system, including a leaking EGR valve (i.e., exhaust gas flowing through the valve when the valve is commanded closed) prior to an increase from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes an increase in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot reduce EGR flow to achieve the commanded flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> EGR slow response. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to any failure or deterioration in the capability of the EGR system to achieve the commanded flow rate within a manufacturer-specified time that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). The OBD system must monitor both the capability of the EGR system to respond to a commanded increase in flow and the capability of the EGR system to respond to a commanded decrease in flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> EGR system feedback control. See paragraph (i)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> EGR cooler performance. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR cooler prior to a reduction from the manufacturer's specified cooling performance that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR cooler could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of EGR cooling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EGR system monitoring conditions. (A) The OBD system must monitor continuously for malfunctions identified in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A), (g)(3)(ii)(B), and (g)(3)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that monitoring must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section

The manufacturer must be able to demonstrate via data or engineering analysis that a reliable system monitor cannot be run when these conditions exist because it cannot robustly distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating system. The manufacturer is still required to maintain comprehensive component monitoring as required in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> EGR system MIL activation and DTC storage. The MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Turbo boost control system monitoring--(i) General. The OBD system must monitor the boost pressure control system (e.g., turbocharger) on engines so equipped for under and over boost malfunctions. For engines equipped with variable geometry turbochargers (VGT), the OBD system must monitor the VGT system for slow response malfunctions. For engines equipped with charge air cooler systems, the OBD system must monitor the charge air cooler system for cooling system performance malfunctions. The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors) that are used in the boost pressure control system must be monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component requirements in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Turbo boost control system malfunction criteria--(A) Turbo underboost. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the boost pressure control system prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's commanded boost pressure, or expected boost pressure on engines not equipped with a boost pressure control system, that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the boost pressure control system that causes a decrease in boost could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot increase boost to achieve the commanded boost pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Turbo overboost. The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the boost pressure control system on engines so equipped prior to an increase from the manufacturer's commanded boost pressure that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the boost pressure control system that causes an increase in boost could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot decrease boost to achieve the commanded boost pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> VGT slow response.

The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to a decrease in the PM filtering capability of the DPF (e.g., cracking, melting, etc.) that would cause an engine's PM emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for DPF systems as shown in Table 1 of this paragraph (g). If no failure or deterioration of the PM filtering performance could result in an engine's PM emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when no detectable amount of PM filtering occurs. As an alternative to a threshold monitor, the OBD system, on model year 2010 through 2012 engines only, can be designed to detect a malfunction based on a detectable decrease in the expected pressure drop across the DPF for a period of 5 seconds or more. The monitoring area for this alternative is determined using engine speed and load points defined in test cycles and procedures for the supplemental emissions test (SET) under Sec. 86.1360-2007. The monitoring area shall include all engine speed and load points greater than a region bounded by a line connecting mode numbers 2, 6, 3, and 13 (i.e. A100, A75, B50, and C50). At engine speeds greater than ``speed

C'', the monitor shall run whenever engine load is greater than 50%. For purposes of this paragraph, the detectable change in pressure drop is determined by operating the engine at the B50 engine speed and load point (as described in the SET test procedures), observing the pressure drop on a clean, nominal DPF, and multiplying the observed pressure drop by 0.5 or other factor supported by data and approved by the Administrator. The detectable change in pressure drop shall be reported in units of kilopascals (kPa). At time of certification, manufacturers shall provide the detectable change in pressure drop value along with OBD data stream parameters recorded with a clean DPF under the following nine engine speed/load operating points of the SET: A50, A75, A100, B50, B75, B100, C50, C75, and C100.

For OBD systems designed to the alternative malfunction criteria of paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, the alternative DPF monitor shall run continuously whenever engine speed and load conditions are within the monitoring area described in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A). The OBD system may make a malfunction or potential malfunction determination during any successful monitoring event but shall include in the enable criteria of any subsequent monitoring events a confirmed successful and complete DPF regeneration.

The OBD system must monitor the fuel delivery system to determine its ability to provide compliance with emission standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel system malfunction criteria. (A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the fuel delivery system (including feedback control based on a secondary oxygen sensor) when the fuel delivery system is unable to maintain an engine's emissions at or below the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, if the engine is equipped with adaptive feedback control, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the adaptive feedback control has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the engine is equipped with feedback control that is based on a secondary oxygen (or equivalent) sensor, the OBD system is not required to detect a malfunction of the fuel system solely when the feedback control based on a secondary oxygen sensor has used

up all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer. However, if a failure or deterioration results in engine emissions that exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h), the OBD system is required to detect a malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The OBD system must detect a malfunction whenever the fuel control system fails to enter closed loop operation following engine start within a manufacturer specified time interval. The specified time interval must be supported by data and/or engineering analyses submitted by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer may adjust the malfunction criteria and/or monitoring conditions to compensate for changes in altitude, for temporary introduction of large amounts of purge vapor, or for other similar identifiable operating conditions when such conditions occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fuel system monitoring conditions. The fuel system must be monitored continuously for the presence of a malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fuel system MIL activation and DTC storage. (A) A pending DTC must be stored immediately upon the fuel system exceeding the malfunction criteria established in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, if a pending DTC is stored, the OBD system must activate the MIL immediately and store a MIL-on DTC if a malfunction is again detected during either the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC regardless of the conditions encountered during that drive cycle, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored. Similar conditions means engine conditions having an engine speed within 375 rpm, load conditions within 20 percent, and the same warm-up status (i.e., cold or hot) as the engine conditions stored pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(E) of this section. Other definitions of similar conditions may be used but must result in comparable timeliness and reliability in detecting similar engine operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The pending DTC may be erased at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions have been encountered without having again exceeded the specified fuel system malfunction criteria. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the 80 drive cycles immediately following detection of the potential malfunction for which the pending DTC was stored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Storage of freeze frame conditions. The OBD system must store and erase freeze frame conditions either in conjunction with storing and erasing a pending DTC or in conjunction with storing and erasing a MIL-on DTC. Freeze frame information associated with a fuel system malfunction shall be stored in preference to freeze frame information required elsewhere in paragraphs (h) or (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Storage of fuel system conditions for determining similar conditions of operation. The OBD must store the engine speed, load, and warm-up status present at the time it first detects a potential malfunction meeting the criteria of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section and stores a pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Deactivating the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three sequential driving cycles in which similar conditions have been encountered without detecting a malfunction of the fuel system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engine misfire monitoring--(i) General. (A) The OBD system must monitor the engine for misfire causing catalyst damage and misfire causing excess emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The OBD system must identify the specific cylinder that is misfiring. The manufacturer may store a general misfire DTC instead of a cylinder specific DTC under certain operating conditions. To do so, the manufacturer must submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that the misfiring cylinder cannot be identified reliably when the conditions occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If more than one cylinder is misfiring, a separate DTC must be stored to indicate that multiple cylinders are misfiring unless otherwise allowed by this paragraph (h)(2). When identifying multiple cylinder misfire, the OBD system is not required to also identify

using separate DTCs each of the misfiring cylinders individually. If more than 90 percent of the detected misfires occur in a single cylinder, an appropriate DTC may be stored that indicates the specific misfiring cylinder rather than storing the multiple cylinder misfire DTC. If two or more cylinders individually have more than 10 percent of the total number of detected misfires, a multiple cylinder DTC must be stored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Engine misfire malfunction criteria--(A) Misfire causing catalyst damage. The manufacturer must determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 200 revolution increments for each engine speed and load condition that would result in a temperature that causes catalyst damage. If this percentage of misfire is exceeded, it shall be considered a malfunction that must be detected. For every engine speed and load condition for which this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than five percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at five percent. The manufacturer may use a longer interval than 200 revolutions but only for determining, on a given drive cycle, the first misfire exceedance as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the interval is not so long that catalyst damage would occur prior to the interval being elapsed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Misfire causing emissions to exceed the applicable thresholds. The manufacturer must determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 1000 revolution increments that would cause emissions from an emissions durability demonstration engine to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h) if that percentage of misfire were present from the beginning of the test. If this percentage of misfire is exceeded, regardless of the pattern of misfire events (e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous), it shall be considered a malfunction that must be detected. To establish this percentage of misfire, the manufacturer must use misfire events occurring at equally spaced, complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly selected cylinders throughout each 1000-revolution increment. If this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than one percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at one percent. The manufacturer may use a longer interval than 1000 revolutions. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the strategy would be equally effective and timely at detecting misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine misfire monitoring conditions. (A) The OBD system must monitor continuously for misfire under the following conditions: from no later than the end of the second crankshaft revolution after engine start; during the rise time and settling time for engine speed to reach the desired idle engine speed at engine start-up (i.e., ``flare-up'' and ``flare-down''); and, under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within the engine operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the points represented by an engine speed of 3000 rpm with the engine load at the positive torque line and the redline engine speed with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of mercury lower than that at the positive torque line. For this purpose, redline engine speed is defined as either the recommended maximum engine speed as displayed on the instrument panel tachometer, or the engine speed at which fuel shutoff occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an OBD monitor cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions as required by paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the OBD system may still be acceptable. The Administrator will evaluate the following factors in making a determination: The magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under the required conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be

based on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer may use monitoring system that has reduced misfire detection capability during the portion of the first 1000 revolutions after engine start that a cold start emission reduction strategy is active that reduces engine torque (e.g., spark retard strategies). To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the probability of detection is greater than or equal to 75 percent during the worst case condition (i.e., lowest generated torque) for a vehicle operated continuously at idle (park/neutral idle) on a cold start between 50 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit and that the technology cannot reliably detect a higher percentage of the misfire events during the conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The manufacturer may disable misfire monitoring or use an alternative malfunction criterion when misfire cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the disablement interval or the period of use of an alternative malfunction criterion is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection and for one or more of the following operating conditions: Rough road; fuel cut; gear changes for manual transmission vehicles; traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as anti-lock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle stability; off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or monitors during service or assembly plant testing; portions of intrusive evaporative system or EGR monitors that can significantly affect engine stability (i.e., while the purge valve is open during the vacuum pull-down of an evaporative system leak check but not while the purge valve is closed and the evaporative system is sealed or while an EGR monitor causes the EGR valve to be cycled intrusively on and off during positive torque conditions); or, engine speed, load, or torque transients due to throttle movements more rapid than those that occur over the FTP cycle for the worst case engine within each engine family. In general, the Administrator will not approve disablement for conditions involving normal air conditioning compressor cycling from on-to-off or off-to-on, automatic transmission gear shifts (except for shifts occurring during wide open throttle operation), transitions from idle to off-idle, normal engine speed or load changes that occur during the engine speed rise time and settling time (i.e., ``flare-up'' and ``flare-down'') immediately after engine starting without any vehicle operator-induced actions (e.g., throttle stabs), or excess acceleration (except for acceleration rates that exceed the maximum acceleration rate obtainable at wide open throttle while the vehicle is in gear due to abnormal conditions such as slipping of a clutch). The Administrator may approve misfire monitoring disablement or use of an alternate malfunction criterion for any other condition on a case by case basis upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the request is based on an unusual or unforeseen circumstance and that it is applying the best available computer and monitoring technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For engines with more than eight cylinders that cannot meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may use alternative misfire monitoring conditions. Such use must be based on data and/or an engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer that demonstrate that misfire detection throughout the required operating region cannot be achieved when employing proven monitoring technology (i.e., a technology that provides for compliance with these requirements on other engines) and provided misfire is detected to the fullest extent permitted by the technology. However, the misfire detection system must still monitor during all positive torque operating conditions encountered during an FTP cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage for engine misfire causing catalyst damage--(A) Pending DTCs. A pending DTC must be stored immediately if, during a single drive cycle, the specified misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is exceeded

three times when operating in the positive torque region encountered during a FTP cycle or is exceeded on a single occasion when operating at any other engine speed and load condition in the positive torque region defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Immediately after a pending DTC is stored pursuant to this paragraph, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. The MIL may be deactivated during those times that misfire is not occurring. If, at the time that a catalyst damaging misfire malfunction occurs, the MIL is already activated for a malfunction other than misfire, the MIL must still blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated as appropriate in accordance with the other malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> MIL-on DTCs. If a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the OBD system must immediately store a MIL-on DTC if the percentage of misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is again exceeded one or more times during either the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC, regardless of the conditions encountered during that drive cycle, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored. If, during a previous drive cycle, a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a MIL-on DTC must be stored immediately upon exceeding the percentage misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section regardless of the conditions encountered. Upon storage of a MIL-on DTC, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated until the conditions are met for extinguishing the MIL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Erasure of pending DTCs. Pending DTCs stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section must be erased at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored provided no exceedances have been detected of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the next 80 drive cycles immediately following storage of the pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exemptions for engines with fuel shutoff and default fuel control. In engines that provide for fuel shutoff and default fuel control to prevent over fueling during catalyst damaging misfire conditions, the MIL need not blink as required by paragraphs (h)(2)(iv)(A) and (h)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Instead, the MIL may be activated continuously upon misfire detection provided that the fuel shutoff and default fuel control are activated immediately upon misfire detection. Fuel shutoff and default fuel control may be deactivated only when the engine is outside of the misfire range except that the manufacturer may periodically, but not more than once every 30 seconds, deactivate fuel shutoff and default fuel control to determine if the catalyst damaging misfire is still occurring. Normal fueling and fuel control may be resumed if the catalyst damaging misfire is no longer occurring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer may use a strategy that activates the MIL continuously rather than blinking the MIL during extreme catalyst damage misfire conditions (i.e., catalyst damage misfire occurring at all engine speeds and loads). Use of such a strategy must be limited to catalyst damage misfire levels that cannot be avoided during reasonable driving conditions. To use such a strategy, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that the strategy will encourage operation of the vehicle in conditions that will minimize catalyst damage (e.g., at low engine speeds and loads).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage for engine misfire causing emissions to exceed applicable emissions thresholds. (A) Immediately upon detection, during the first 1000 revolutions after engine start of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a pending DTC must be stored. If such a

pending DTC is stored already and another such exceedance of the misfire percentage is detected within the first 1000 revolutions after engine start on any subsequent drive cycle, the MIL must activate and a MIL-on DTC must be stored. The pending DTC may be erased if, at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored, there has been no exceedance of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the next 80 drive cycles immediately following storage of the pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No later than the fourth detection during a single drive cycle, following the first 1000 revolutions after engine start of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a pending DTC must be stored. If such a pending DTC is stored already, then the MIL must activate and a MIL-on DTC must be stored within 10 seconds of the fourth detection of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section during either the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC, regardless of the conditions encountered during that drive cycle excepting those conditions within the first 1000 revolutions after engine start, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored excepting those conditions within the first 1000 revolutions after engine start. The pending DTC may be erased if, at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored, there has been no exceedance of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the next 80 drive cycles immediately following storage of the pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Storage of freeze frame conditions for engine misfire. (A) The OBD system must store and erase freeze frame conditions (as defined in paragraph (k)(4)(iii) of this section) either in conjunction with storing and erasing a pending DTC or in conjunction with storing and erasing a MIL-on DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If, upon storage of a DTC as required by paragraphs (h)(2)(iv) and (h)(2)(v) of this section, there already exist stored freeze frame conditions for a malfunction other than a misfire or fuel system malfunction (see paragraph (h)(1) of this section) then the stored freeze frame information shall be replaced with freeze frame information associated with the misfire malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Storage of engine conditions in association with engine misfire. Upon detection of the misfire percentages described in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii)(A) and (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the following engine conditions must be stored for use in determining similar conditions: Engine speed, load, and warm up status of the first misfire event that resulted in pending DTC storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> MIL deactivation in association with engine misfire. The MIL may be deactivated after three sequential drive cycles in which similar conditions have been encountered without an exceedance of the misfire percentages described in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii)(A) and (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exhaust gas recirculation system monitoring--(i) General. The OBD system must monitor the EGR system on engines so equipped for low and high flow rate malfunctions. The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors) that are used in the EGR system must be monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component requirements in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> EGR system malfunction criteria. (A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes a decrease in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions

thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of EGR flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The OBD system must detect a malfunction of the EGR system prior to an increase from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h). For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that causes an increase in flow could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that it cannot reduce EGR flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EGR system monitoring conditions. (A) The manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section must be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer may disable temporarily the EGR monitor under conditions when monitoring may not be reliable (e.g., when freezing may affect performance of the system). To do so, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that the monitor is unreliable when such conditions exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> EGR system MIL activation and DTC storage. The MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cold start emission reduction strategy monitoring--(i) General. If an engine incorporates a specific engine control strategy to reduce cold start emissions, the OBD system must monitor the key components (e.g., idle air control valve), other than secondary air, while the control strategy is active to ensure proper operation of the control strategy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cold start strategy malfunction criteria. (A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration of the individual components associated with the cold start emission reduction control strategy that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h). The manufacturer must establish the malfunction criteria based on data from one or more representative engine(s) and provide an engineering evaluation for establishing the malfunction criteria for the remainder of the manufacturer's product line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where no failure or deterioration of a component used for the cold start emission reduction strategy could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the individual component must be monitored for proper functional response while the control strategy is active in accordance with the malfunction criteria in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii) and (i)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cold start strategy monitoring conditions. The manufacturer must define monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cold start strategy MIL activation and DTC storage. The MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Secondary air system monitoring--(i) General. The OBD system on engines equipped with any form of secondary air delivery system must monitor the proper functioning of the secondary air delivery system including all air switching valve(s). The individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves, sensors) that are used in the secondary air system must be monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component requirements in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(5), ``air flow'' is defined as the air flow delivered by the secondary air system to the exhaust system. For engines using secondary air systems with multiple air flow paths/distribution points, the air flow to each bank (i.e., a group of cylinders that share a common exhaust manifold, catalyst, and control sensor) must be monitored in accordance with

the malfunction criteria in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section. Also for purposes of this paragraph (h)(5), ``normal operation'' is defined as the condition when the secondary air system is activated during catalyst and/or engine warm-up following engine start. ``Normal operation'' does not include the condition when the secondary air system is turned on intrusively for the sole purpose of monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Secondary air system malfunction criteria. (A) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the OBD system must detect a secondary air system malfunction prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified air flow during normal operation that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the OBD system must detect a secondary air system malfunction prior to an increase from the manufacturer's specified air flow during normal operation that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emissions thresholds for ``other monitors'' as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For engines in which no deterioration or failure of the secondary air system would result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when no detectable amount of air flow is delivered by the secondary air system during normal operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Secondary air system monitoring conditions.

The manufacturer must define monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

The OBD system must verify purge flow from the evaporative system and monitor the complete evaporative system, excluding the tubing and connections between the purge valve and the intake manifold, for vapor leaks to the atmosphere.

The OBD system must detect an evaporative system malfunction when the complete evaporative system contains a leak or leaks that cumulatively are greater than or equal to a leak caused by a 0.150 inch diameter hole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer may demonstrate that detection of a larger hole is more appropriate than that specified in paragraph (h)(7)(ii)(B) of this section. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate through data and/or engineering analyses that holes smaller than the proposed detection size would not result in evaporative or running loss emissions that exceed 1.5 times the applicable evaporative emissions standards. Upon such a demonstration, the proposed detection size could be substituted for the requirement of paragraph (h)(7)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evaporative system monitoring conditions.

The alternative indicator must be of sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions. If the vehicle is not equipped with such an alternative indicator, the MIL must activate and a DTC be stored as required in paragraph (h)(7)(iv)(A) of this section; however, these may be deactivated and erased, respectively, if the OBD system determines that the gas cap problem has been corrected and the MIL has not been activated for any other malfunction. The Administrator may approve other strategies that provide equivalent assurance that a vehicle operator will be notified promptly of a missing or improperly secured gas cap and that corrective action will be undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Exhaust gas sensor monitoring--(i) General.

The OBD system must detect if, within the manufacturer specified time interval following engine start, the ECT sensor does not achieve the highest stabilized minimum temperature that is needed to initiate closed-loop/feedback control of all affected emission control systems (e.g., fuel system, EGR system). The manufacturer specified time interval must be a function of the engine coolant temperature and/or intake air temperature at startup. The manufacturer time interval must be supported by data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating that it provides robust monitoring and minimizes the likelihood of other OBD monitors being disabled.

To the extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD system must detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a temperature below the highest minimum enable temperature required by the OBD system to enable other monitors (e.g., an OBD system that requires ECT to be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit to enable a diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to inappropriately indicate a temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit). The manufacturer may forego this requirement for temperature regions in which the monitors required under paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) or (i)(1)(iii)(B) of this section will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in this paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Stuck in range above the lowest maximum enable temperature. The OBD system must detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a temperature above the lowest maximum enable temperature required by the OBD system to enable other monitors (e.g., an OBD system that requires an engine coolant temperature less than 90 degrees Fahrenheit at startup prior to enabling an OBD monitor must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to indicate inappropriately a temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit). The manufacturer may forego this requirement within temperature regions in which the monitors required under paragraphs (i)(1)(ii), (i)(1)(iii)(B), (i)(1)(iii)(C) of this section will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in this paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(D) or in which the MIL will be activated according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.

The OBD system must monitor the CV system on engines so equipped for system integrity. Engines not required to be equipped with CV systems are exempt from monitoring the CV system. For diesel engines, the manufacturer must submit a plan for Administrator approval prior to OBD certification. That plan must include descriptions of the monitoring strategy, malfunction criteria, and monitoring conditions for CV system monitoring. The plan must demonstrate that the CV system monitor is of equivalent effectiveness, to the extent feasible, to the malfunction criteria and the monitoring conditions of this paragraph (i)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Crankcase ventilation system malfunction criteria. (A) For the purposes of this paragraph (i)(2), ``CV system'' is defined as any form of crankcase ventilation system, regardless of whether it utilizes positive pressure. ``CV valve'' is defined as any form of valve or orifice used to restrict or control crankcase vapor flow. Further, any additional external CV system tubing or hoses used to equalize crankcase pressure or to provide a ventilation path between various areas of the engine (e.g., crankcase and valve cover) are considered part of the CV system ``between the crankcase and the CV valve'' and subject to the malfunction criteria in paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided for in paragraphs (i)(2)(ii)(C) through (i)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the OBD system must detect a malfunction of the CV system when a disconnection of the system occurs between either the crankcase and the CV valve, or between the CV valve and the intake manifold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer may forego monitoring for a disconnection between the crankcase and the CV valve provided the CV system is designed such that the CV valve is fastened directly to the crankcase such that it is significantly more difficult to remove the CV valve from the crankcase than to disconnect the line between the CV valve and the intake manifold (taking aging effects into consideration). To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or an engineering evaluation demonstrating that the CV system is so designed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The manufacturer may forego monitoring for a disconnection between the crankcase and the CV valve provided the CV system is designed such that it uses tubing connections between the CV valve and the crankcase that are: resistant to deterioration or accidental disconnection; significantly more difficult to disconnect than is the line between the CV valve and the intake manifold; and, not subject to disconnection per the manufacturer's repair procedures for any non-CV system repair. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering evaluation demonstrating that the CV system is so designed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer may forego monitoring for a disconnection between the CV valve and the intake

manifold provided the CV system is designed such that any disconnection either causes the engine to stall immediately during idle operation, or is unlikely to occur due to a CV system design that is integral to the induction system (e.g., machined passages rather than tubing or hoses). To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or an engineering evaluation demonstrating that the CV system is so designed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Crankcase ventilation system monitoring conditions. The manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Crankcase ventilation system MIL activation and DTC storage. The MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. The stored DTC need not identify specifically the CV system (e.g., a DTC for idle speed control or fuel system monitoring can be stored) if the manufacturer can demonstrate that additional monitoring hardware is necessary to make such an identification and provided the manufacturer's diagnostic and repair procedures for the detected malfunction include directions to check the integrity of the CV system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comprehensive component monitoring--(i) General. Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the OBD system must detect a malfunction of any electronic engine component or system not otherwise described in paragraphs (g), (h), (i)(1), and (i)(2) of this section that either provides input to (directly or indirectly, such components may include the crank angle sensor, knock sensor, throttle position sensor, cam position sensor, intake air temperature sensor, boost pressure sensor, manifold pressure sensor, mass air flow sensor, exhaust temperature sensor, exhaust pressure sensor, fuel pressure sensor, fuel composition sensor of a flexible fuel vehicle, etc.) or receives commands from (such components or systems may include the idle speed control system, glow plug system, variable length intake manifold runner systems, supercharger or turbocharger electronic components, heated fuel preparation systems, the wait-to-start lamp on diesel applications, the MIL, etc.) the onboard computer(s) and meets either of the criteria described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) and/or (i)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Note that, for the purposes of this paragraph (i)(3), ``electronic engine component or system'' does not include components that are driven by the engine and are not related to the control of the fueling, air handling, or emissions of the engine (e.g., PTO components, air conditioning system components, and power steering components).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It can cause emissions to exceed applicable emission standards. To preclude monitoring, the manufacturer must be able to provide emission data showing that the component or system, when malfunctioning and installed on a suitable test engine, does not cause emissions to exceed the emission standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It is used as part of the monitoring strategy for any other monitored system or component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comprehensive component malfunction criteria for input components. (A) The OBD system must detect malfunctions of input components caused by a lack of circuit continuity and out-of-range values. In addition, where feasible, rationality checks must also be done and shall verify that a sensor output is neither inappropriately high nor inappropriately low (i.e., ``two-sided'' monitoring).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To the extent feasible, the OBD system must separately detect and store different DTCs that distinguish rationality malfunctions from lack of circuit continuity and out-of-range malfunctions. For lack of circuit continuity and out-of-range malfunctions, the OBD system must, to the extent feasible, separately detect and store different DTCs for each distinct malfunction (e.g., out-of-range low, out-of-range high, open circuit). The OBD system is not required to store separate DTCs for lack of circuit continuity malfunctions that cannot be distinguished from other out-of-range circuit malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For input components that are used to activate alternative strategies that can affect emissions (e.g., AECDs,

engine shutdown systems), the OBD system must conduct rationality checks to detect malfunctions that cause the system to activate erroneously or deactivate the alternative strategy. To the extent feasible when using all available information, the rationality check must detect a malfunction if the input component inappropriately indicates a value that activates or deactivates the alternative strategy. For example, for an alternative strategy that activates when the intake air temperature is greater than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the OBD system must detect malfunctions that cause the intake air temperature sensor to indicate inappropriately a temperature above 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For engines that require precise alignment between the camshaft and the crankshaft, the OBD system must monitor the crankshaft position sensor(s) and camshaft position sensor(s) to verify proper alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft in addition to monitoring the sensors for circuit continuity and proper rationality. Proper alignment monitoring between a camshaft and a crankshaft is required only in cases where both are equipped with position sensors. For engines equipped with VVT systems and a timing belt or chain, the OBD system must detect a malfunction if the alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft is off by one or more cam/crank sprocket cogs (e.g., the timing belt/chain has slipped by one or more teeth/cogs). If a manufacturer demonstrates that a single tooth/cog misalignment cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the minimum number of teeth/cogs misalignment has occurred that does cause a measurable emission increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comprehensive component malfunction criteria for output components/systems. (A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of an output component/system when proper functional response does not occur in response to computer commands. If such a functional check is not feasible, the OBD system must detect malfunctions of output components/systems caused by a lack of circuit continuity or circuit malfunction (e.g., short to ground or high voltage). For output component lack of circuit continuity malfunctions and circuit malfunctions, the OBD system is not required to store different DTCs for each distinct malfunction (e.g., open circuit, shorted low). Manufacturers are not required to activate an output component/system when it would not normally be active for the sole purpose of performing a functional check of it as required in this paragraph (i)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For gasoline engines, the idle control system must be monitored for proper functional response to computer commands. For gasoline engines using monitoring strategies based on deviation from target idle speed, a malfunction must be detected when either of the following conditions occurs: The idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed within 200 revolutions per minute (rpm) above the target speed or 100 rpm below the target speed; or, the idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed within the smallest engine speed tolerance range required by the OBD system to enable any other monitors. Regarding the former of these conditions, the manufacturer may use larger engine speed tolerances. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that the tolerances can be exceeded without a malfunction being present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For diesel engines, the idle control system must be monitored for proper functional response to computer commands. For diesel engines, a malfunction must be detected when either of the following conditions occurs: the idle fuel control system cannot achieve the target idle speed or fuel injection quantity within [50 percent of the manufacturer-specified fuel quantity and engine speed tolerances; or, the idle fuel control system cannot achieve the target idle speed or fueling quantity within the smallest engine speed or fueling quantity tolerance range required by the OBD system to enable any other monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For model years 2010 through 2012, glow plugs must be monitored for circuit continuity malfunctions. For model years 2010 and later, intake air

heater systems and, for model years 2013 and later, glow plugs must be monitored for proper functional response to computer commands and for circuit continuity malfunctions. The glow plug/intake air heater circuit(s) must be monitored for proper current and voltage drop. The manufacturer may use other monitoring strategies but must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate reliable and timely detection of malfunctions. The OBD system must also detect a malfunction when a single glow plug no longer operates within the manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation. If a manufacturer can demonstrate that a single glow plug malfunction cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition, the OBD system must instead detect a malfunction when the number of glow plugs needed to cause an emission increase is malfunctioning. To the extent feasible, the stored DTC must identify the specific malfunctioning glow plug(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The wait-to-start lamp circuit and the MIL circuit must be monitored for malfunctions that cause either lamp to fail to activate when commanded to do so (e.g., burned out bulb). This monitoring of the wait-to-start lamp circuit and the MIL circuit is not required for wait-to-start lamps and MILs using light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monitoring conditions for input components. (A) The OBD system must monitor input components continuously for out-of-range values and circuit continuity. The manufacturer may disable continuous monitoring for circuit continuity and out-of-range values when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that a properly functioning input component cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning input component and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false malfunction detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For input component rationality checks (where applicable), the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that rationality checks must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Monitoring conditions for output components/systems. (A) The OBD system must monitor output components/systems continuously for circuit continuity and circuit malfunctions. The manufacturer may disable continuous monitoring for circuit continuity and circuit malfunctions when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that a properly functioning output component/system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning one and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false malfunction detection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For output component/system functional checks, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Specifically for the idle control system, the manufacturer must define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with the exception that functional checks must occur every time the monitoring conditions are met during the drive cycle rather than once per drive cycle as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Comprehensive component MIL activation and DTC storage. (A) Except as provided for in paragraphs (i)(3)(vi)(B) and (i)(3)(vi)(C) of this section, the MIL must activate and DTCs must be stored according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The MIL need not be activated in conjunction with storing a MIL-on DTC for any comprehensive component if: the component or system, when malfunctioning, could not cause engine emissions to increase by 15 percent or more of the applicable FTP standard during any reasonable driving condition; or, the component or system is not used as part of the monitoring

strategy for any other system or component that is required to be monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The MIL need not be activated if a malfunction has been detected in the MIL circuit that prevents the MIL from activating (e.g., burned out bulb or light-emitting diode, LED). Nonetheless, the electronic MIL status (see paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section) must be reported as MIL commanded-on and a MIL-on DTC must be stored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other emission control system monitoring--(i) General. For other emission control systems that are either not addressed in paragraphs (g) through (i)(3) of this section (e.g., hydrocarbon traps, homogeneous charge compression ignition control systems), or addressed in paragraph (i)(3) of this section but not corrected or compensated for by an adaptive control system (e.g., swirl control valves), the manufacturer must submit a plan for Administrator approval of the monitoring strategy, malfunction criteria, and monitoring conditions prior to introduction on a production engine. The plan must demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring strategy, the malfunction criteria used, the monitoring conditions required by the monitor, and, if applicable, the determination that the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For engines that use emission control systems that alter intake air flow or cylinder charge characteristics by actuating valve(s), flap(s), etc., in the intake air delivery system (e.g., swirl control valve systems), the manufacturer, in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section, may elect to have the OBD system monitor the shaft to which all valves in one intake bank are physically attached rather than performing a functional check of the intake air flow, cylinder charge, or individual valve(s)/flap(s). For non-metal shafts or segmented shafts, the monitor must verify all shaft segments for proper functional response (e.g., by verifying that the segment or portion of the shaft farthest from the actuator functions properly). For systems that have more than one shaft to operate valves in multiple intake banks, the manufacturer is not required to add more than one set of detection hardware (e.g., sensor, switch) per intake bank to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions to OBD monitoring requirements. (i) The Administrator may revise the PM filtering performance malfunction criteria for DPFs to exclude detection of specific failure modes such as partially melted substrates, if the most reliable monitoring method developed requires it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer may disable an OBD system monitor at ambient engine start temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit (low ambient temperature conditions may be determined based on intake air or engine coolant temperature at engine start) or at elevations higher than 8,000 feet above sea level. To do so, the manufacturer must submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that monitoring is unreliable during the disable conditions. A manufacturer may request that an OBD system monitor be disabled at other ambient engine start temperatures by submitting data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating that misdiagnosis would occur at the given ambient temperatures due to their effect on the component itself (e.g., component freezing).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer may disable an OBD system monitor when the fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal fuel tank capacity for those monitors that can be affected by low fuel level or running out of fuel (e.g., misfire detection). To do so, the manufacturer must submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that monitoring at the given fuel levels is unreliable, and that the OBD system is still able to detect a malfunction if the component(s) used to determine fuel level indicates erroneously a fuel level that causes the disablement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer may disable OBD monitors that can be affected by engine battery or system voltage levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For an OBD monitor affected by low vehicle battery or system voltages, manufacturers may disable monitoring when the battery or system voltage is below 11.0 Volts. The manufacturer may use a voltage threshold higher than 11.0 Volts to disable monitors but must submit data and/or engineering

analyses that demonstrate that monitoring at those voltages is unreliable and that either operation of a vehicle below the disablement criteria for extended periods of time is unlikely or the OBD system monitors the battery or system voltage and will detect a malfunction at the voltage used to disable other monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For an OBD monitor affected by high engine battery or system voltages, the manufacturer may disable monitoring when the battery or system voltage exceeds a manufacturer-defined voltage. To do so, the manufacturer must submit data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that monitoring above the manufacturer-defined voltage is unreliable and that either the electrical charging system/alternator warning light will be activated (or voltage gauge would be in the ``red zone'') or the OBD system monitors the battery or system voltage and will detect a malfunction at the voltage used to disable other monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The manufacturer may also disable affected OBD monitors in systems designed to accommodate the installation of power take off (PTO) units provided monitors are disabled only while the PTO unit is active and the OBD readiness status (see paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section) is cleared by the onboard computer (i.e., all monitors set to indicate ``not complete'' or ``not ready'') while the PTO unit is activated. If monitors are so disabled and when the disablement ends, the readiness status may be restored to its state prior to PTO activation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Feedback control system monitoring. If the engine is equipped with feedback control of any of the systems covered in paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) of this section, then the OBD system must detect as malfunctions the conditions specified in this paragraph (i)(6) for each of the individual feedback controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The OBD system must detect when the system fails to begin feedback control within a manufacturer specified time interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When any malfunction or deterioration causes open loop or limp-home operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When feedback control has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer may temporarily disable monitoring for malfunctions specified in paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section during conditions that the specific monitor cannot distinguish robustly between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating system. To do so, the manufacturer is required to submit data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating that the individual feedback control system, when operating as designed on an engine with all emission controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions while having used up all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer. In lieu of detecting, with a system specific monitor, the malfunctions specified in paragraphs (i)(6)(i) and (i)(6)(ii) of this section the OBD system may monitor the individual parameters or components that are used as inputs for individual feedback control systems provided that the monitors detect all malfunctions that meet the criteria of paragraphs (i)(6)(i) and (i)(6)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Production evaluation testing--(1) Verification of standardization requirements. (i) For model years 2013 and later, the manufacturer must perform testing to verify that production vehicles meet the requirements of paragraphs (k)(3) and (k)(4) of this section relevant to the proper communication of required emissions-related messages to a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selection of test vehicles. (A) The manufacturer must perform this testing every model year on ten unique production vehicles (i.e., engine rating and chassis application combination) per engine family. If there are less than ten unique production vehicles for a certain engine family, the manufacturer must test each unique production vehicle in that engine family. The manufacturer must perform this testing within either three months of the start of engine production or one month of the start of vehicle production, whichever is later. The manufacturer may request approval to group multiple production vehicles together and test one representative vehicle per group. To do so, the software and hardware designed to comply with the

standardization requirements of paragraph (k)(1) of this section (e.g., communication protocol message timing, number of supported data stream parameters, engine and vehicle communication network architecture) in the representative vehicle must be identical to all others in the group and any differences in the production vehicles cannot be relevant with respect to meeting the criteria of paragraph (j)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For 2016 and subsequent model years, the required number of vehicles to be tested shall be reduced to five per engine family provided zero vehicles fail the testing required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section for two consecutive years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For 2019 and subsequent model years, the required number of vehicles to be tested shall be reduced to three per engine family provided zero vehicles fail the testing required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section for three consecutive years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The requirement for submittal of data from one or more of the production vehicles shall be waived if data have been submitted previously for all of the production vehicles. The manufacturer may request approval to carry over data collected in previous model years. To do so, the software and hardware designed to comply with the standardization requirements of paragraph (k)(1) of this section must be identical to the previous model year and there must not have been other hardware or software changes that affect compliance with the standardization requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For hybrid engine families with projected U.S.-directed production volume of less than 5,000 engines, the manufacturers are only required to test one engine-hybrid combination per family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Test equipment.

This report must be submitted within one month of testing the specific variant. The Administrator will consider the proposed remedy and, if in disagreement, will work with the manufacturer to propose an alternative remedy. Factors to be considered by the Administrator in considering the proposed remedy will include the severity of the problem(s), the ability of service technicians to access the required diagnostic information, the impact on equipment and tool manufacturers, and the amount of time prior to implementation of the proposed corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Alternative testing protocols. Manufacturers may request approval to use other testing protocols. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the alternative testing methods and equipment will provide an equivalent level of verification of compliance with the standardization requirements as is required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Verification of monitoring requirements. (i) Within either the first six months of the start of engine production or the first three months of the start of vehicle production, whichever is later, the manufacturer must conduct a complete evaluation of the OBD system of one or more production vehicles (test vehicles) and submit the results of the evaluation to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selection of test vehicles. (A) For each engine selected for monitoring system demonstration in paragraph (l) of this section, the manufacturer must evaluate one production vehicle equipped with an engine from the same engine family and rating as the demonstration engine. The vehicle selection must be approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the manufacturer is required to test more than one test vehicle, the manufacturer may test an engine in lieu of a vehicle for all but one of the required test vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requirement for submittal of data from one or more of the test vehicles may be waived if data have been submitted previously for all of the engine ratings and variants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evaluation requirements. (A) The evaluation must demonstrate the ability of the OBD system on the selected test vehicle to detect a malfunction, activate the MIL, and, where applicable, store an appropriate DTC readable by a scan tool when a malfunction is present and the monitoring conditions have been satisfied for each individual monitor required by this section. For model years 2013 and later, the evaluation must demonstrate the ability of the OBD system on the selected test

vehicle to detect a malfunction, activate the MIL, and, where applicable, store an appropriate DTC readable by a SAE J1978 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) scan tool when a malfunction is present and the monitoring conditions have been satisfied for each individual monitor required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The evaluation must verify that the malfunction of any component used to enable another OBD monitor but that does not itself result in MIL activation (e.g., fuel level sensor) will not inhibit the ability of other OBD monitors to detect malfunctions properly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The evaluation must verify that the software used to track the numerator and denominator for the purpose of determining in-use monitoring frequency increments as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Malfunctions may be implanted mechanically or simulated electronically, but internal onboard computer hardware or software changes shall not be used to simulate malfunctions. For monitors that are required to indicate a malfunction before emissions exceed an emission threshold, manufacturers are not required to use malfunctioning components/systems set exactly at their malfunction criteria limits. Emission testing is not required to confirm that the malfunction is detected before the appropriate emission thresholds are exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer must submit a proposed test plan for approval prior to performing evaluation testing. The test plan must identify the method used to induce a malfunction for each monitor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the demonstration of a specific monitor cannot be reasonably performed without causing physical damage to the test vehicle (e.g., onboard computer internal circuit malfunctions), the manufacturer may omit the specific demonstration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> For evaluation of test vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer is not required to demonstrate monitors that were demonstrated prior to certification as required in paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer must submit a report of the results of all testing conducted as required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section.

For model years 2010 through 2012, the manufacturer defined data link connector must be accessible to a trained service technician. For model years 2013 and later, a standard data link connector conforming to SAE J1962 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) or SAE J1939-13 (as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) specifications (except as provided for in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) if this section) must be included in each vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For model years 2013 and later, the connector must be located in the driver's side foot-well region of the vehicle interior in the area bound by the driver's side of the vehicle and the driver's side edge of the center console (or the vehicle centerline if the vehicle does not have a center console) and at a location no higher than the bottom of the steering wheel when in the lowest adjustable position. The connector shall not be located on or in the center console (i.e., neither on the horizontal faces near the floor-mounted gear selector, parking brake lever, or cup-holders nor on the vertical faces near the car stereo, climate system, or navigation system controls). The location of the connector shall be capable of being easily identified and accessed (e.g., to connect an off-board tool). For vehicles equipped with a driver's side door, the connector must be identified and accessed easily by someone standing (or ``crouched'') on the ground outside the driver's side of the vehicle with the driver's side door open. The Administrator may approve an alternative location upon request from the manufacturer. In all cases, the installation position of the connector must be both identified and accessed easily by someone standing outside the vehicle and protected from accidental damage during normal vehicle use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For model years 2013 and later, if the connector is covered, the cover must be removable by hand without the use of any tools and be labeled ``OBD'' to aid technicians in identifying the location of the connector.

All components or systems identified in paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), or (i)(3) of this section that are monitored continuously must always indicate ``complete.'' Components or systems that are not subject to being monitored continuously must immediately indicate

``complete'' upon the respective monitor(s) being executed fully and determining that the component or system is not malfunctioning. A component or system must also indicate ``complete'' if, after the requisite number of decisions necessary for determining MIL status has been executed fully, the monitor indicates a malfunction of the component or system. The status for each of the monitored components or systems must indicate ``not complete'' whenever diagnostic memory has been cleared or erased by a means other than that allowed in paragraph (b) of this section. Normal vehicle shut down (i.e., key-off/engine-off) shall not cause the status to indicate ``not complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer may request that the ready status for a monitor be set to indicate ``complete'' without the monitor having completed if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number of drive cycles due to the continued presence of extreme operating conditions (e.g., cold ambient temperatures, high altitudes).

If the ready status for one or more of the monitored components or systems is ``not complete,'' after at least 5 seconds of operation in the key-on/engine-off position with the MIL activated continuously, the MIL shall blink once per second for 5-10 seconds. The data stream value for MIL status as required in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section must indicate ``commanded off'' during this sequence unless the MIL has also been ``commanded on'' for a detected malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Data stream.

For model years 2013 and later, the following signals must be made available on demand through the standardized data link connector in accordance with SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) specifications. The actual signal value must always be used instead of a limp home value. Data link signals may report an error state or other predefined status indicator if they are defined for those signals in the SAE J1979 or SAE J1939 (both as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For gasoline engines.

A unique CAL ID must be used for every emission-related calibration and/or software set having at least one bit of different data from any other emission-related calibration and/or software set. Control units coded with multiple emission or diagnostic calibrations and/or software sets must indicate a unique CAL ID for each variant in a manner that enables an off-board device to determine which variant is being used by the engine. Control units that use a strategy that will result in MIL activation if the incorrect variant is used (e.g., control units that contain variants for manual and automatic transmissions but will activate the MIL if the selected variant does not match the type of transmission mated to the engine) are not required to use unique CAL IDs.

With respect to the misfire monitor demonstration test, if the manufacturer has elected to use the minimum misfire malfunction criteria of one percent as allowed in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(B), if applicable, and (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, no further demonstration is required provided the MIL activates with engine misfire occurring at the malfunction criteria limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the MIL does not activate when the system or component is set at its malfunction criteria limit(s), the criteria limit(s) or the OBD system is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except for testing of the catalyst or DPF system, if the MIL first activates after emissions exceed the applicable malfunction criteria specified in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section, the test engine shall be retested with the tested system or component adjusted so that the MIL will activate before emissions exceed the applicable malfunction criteria specified in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section. If the component cannot be so adjusted because an alternative fuel or emission control strategy is used when a malfunction is detected (e.g., open loop fuel control used after an oxygen sensor malfunction is detected), the test engine shall be retested with the component adjusted to the worst acceptable limit (i.e., the applicable OBD monitor indicates that the component is performing at or slightly better than the malfunction criteria limit). When tested with the component so adjusted, the MIL must not activate during the test and the engine emissions must be below the applicable malfunction criteria specified in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In testing the catalyst or DPF system, if the MIL first activates after emissions exceed the applicable emissions threshold(s) specified in paragraphs (g) and (h), the tested engine shall be retested with a less deteriorated catalyst or DPF system (i.e., more of the applicable engine out pollutants are converted or trapped). For the OBD system to be approved, testing shall be continued until the MIL activates with emissions below the applicable thresholds of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, or the MIL activates with emissions within a range no more than 20 percent below the applicable emissions thresholds and 10 percent or less above those emissions thresholds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If an OBD system is determined to be unacceptable by the criteria of this paragraph (l)(5) of this section, the manufacturer may recalibrate and retest the system on the same test engine.

The manufacturer shall make available, if requested, an engine and all test equipment (e.g., malfunction simulators, deteriorated components) necessary to duplicate the manufacturer's testing. Such a request from the Administrator shall occur within six months of reviewing and approving the demonstration test engine data submitted by the manufacturer for the specific engine rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Catalyst aging--(i) Diesel catalysts.

Manufacturers choosing to use the provisions of this paragraph (q) must submit an annual pre-compliance report to EPA for model years 2013 and later, as specified in paragraph (q)(5) of this section. Note that all hybrid powertrain systems must be fully compliant with the OBD requirements of this section no later than model year 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If an engine-hybrid system has been certified by the California Air Resources Board with respect to its OBD requirements and it effectively meets the full OBD requirements of this section, all equivalent systems must meet those same requirements and may not be certified under this paragraph (q). For purposes of this paragraph (q)(1), an engine-hybrid system is considered to be equivalent to the certified system if it uses the same basic design (e.g. displacement) for the engine and primary hybrid components (see paragraph (q)(4) of this section). Equivalent systems may have minor hardware or calibration differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As of 2013, if an engine-hybrid system has not been certified to meet the full OBD requirements of this section, it must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The engine in its installed configuration must meet the EMD and EMD+ requirements in 13 CCR Sec. 1971.1(d)(7.1.4) of the California Code of Regulations.

This allowance does not apply for OBD monitors or diagnostics that have been modified under paragraph (q)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The engine-hybrid system must maintain existing OBD capability for engines where the same or equivalent engine has been OBD certified. An equivalent engine is one produced by the same engine manufacturer with the same fundamental design, but that may have hardware or calibration differences that do not impact OBD functionality, such as slightly different displacement, rated power, or fuel system. (Note that engines with the same fundamental design will be presumed to be equivalent unless the manufacturer demonstrates that the differences effectively preclude applying equivalent OBD systems.) Though the OBD capability must be maintained, it does not have to meet detection thresholds (as described in Tables 1 and 2 of this section) and in-use performance frequency requirements (as described in paragraph (d) of this section). A manufacturer may modify detection thresholds to prevent false detection, and must indicate all deviations from the originally certified package with engineering justification in the certification documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> This paragraph (q)(2)(iii) applies for derivatives of hybrid powertrain system designs that were offered for sale prior to January 1, 2013. Until these systems achieve full OBD certification, they must at a minimum maintain all fault-detection and diagnostic capability included on similar systems offered for sale prior to 2013.

If engine manufacturers certify the engine hybrid system, they must provide detailed installation instructions. Where the engine manufacturer does not specifically certify its engines for use in hybrid vehicles under this paragraph (q), the hybrid system manufacturer and vehicle manufacturer must install the engine to conform to the requirements of this section (i.e., full OBD) or recertify under paragraph (q)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (q) apply for model year 2016 engines where you demonstrate that the hybrid powertrain system used is a derivative of a design that was offered for sale prior to January 1, 2013. In this case, you may ask us to consider the original system and the later system to be the same model for purposes of this paragraph (q), unless the systems are fundamentally different. In determining whether such systems are derivative or fundamentally different, we will consider factors such as the similarity of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transmissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hybrid machines (where ``hybrid machine'' means any system that is

the part of a hybrid vehicle system that captures energy from and returns energy to the powertrain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hybrid architecture (such as parallel or series).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Motor/generator size, controller/CPU (memory or inputs/outputs), control algorithm, and batteries.

Engine manufacturers must submit this report with their engine certification information. Hybrid manufacturers that are not certifying the engine-hybrid system must submit their report by June 1 of the model year, or at the time of certification if they choose to certify. Include the following in the report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the manufacturer's product plans and of the engine-hybrid systems being certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of activities undertaken and progress made by the manufacturer towards achieving full OBD certification, including monitoring, diagnostics, and standardization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For model year 2016 engines, a description of your basis for applying the provision of this paragraph (q) to the engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Manufacturers that modify the engine's diagnostic system from the approved configuration to be compatible with a hybrid powertrain system under this paragraph (q) must add the following compliance statement to the ECI label: ``for use in hybrid applications only''.

Sec. 86.012-2  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">The definitions of Sec. 86.010-2 continue to apply to model year 2010 and later model year vehicles. The definitions listed in this section apply beginning with model year 2012. Urban bus means a passenger-carrying vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers and intended primarily for intracity operation, i.e., within the confines of a city or greater metropolitan

area. Urban bus operation is characterized by short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation, more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens, rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, large luggage compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage.

Unless specified otherwise, if engines are not subject to provisions of this subpart or if manufacturers choose not to meet optional provisions of this subpart as described in paragraph (a) of this section, those engines must be installed in vehicles meeting the corresponding requirements under subpart S of this part. If a vehicle and its installed engine comply with a mix of provisions from this subpart and from subpart S of this part, the vehicle must be certified under subpart S of this part, and the engine does not need to be certified separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Greenhouse gas emission standards. See 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 for greenhouse gas emission standards that apply for heavy-duty engines and vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Non-petroleum fueled vehicles. The standards and requirements of this part apply to model year 2016 and later non-petroleum fueled motor vehicles as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standards and requirements of this part apply as specified for vehicles fueled with methanol, natural gas, and LPG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The standards and requirements of subpart S of this part apply as specified for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The standards and requirements of this part applicable to methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles and engines (including flexible fuel vehicles and engines) apply to heavy-duty vehicles and engines fueled with any oxygenated fuel (including flexible fuel vehicles and engines). Most significantly, this means that the hydrocarbon standards apply as NMHCE and the vehicles and engines must be tested using the applicable oxygenated fuel according to the test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065 applicable for oxygenated fuels. For purposes of this paragraph (d), oxygenated fuel means any fuel containing at least 50 volume percent oxygenated compounds. For example, a fuel mixture of 85 gallons of ethanol and 15 gallons of gasoline is an oxygenated fuel, while a fuel mixture of 15 gallons of ethanol and 85 gallons of gasoline is not an oxygenated fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The standards and requirements of subpart S of this part applicable to heavy-duty vehicles under 14,000 pounds GVWR apply to all heavy-duty vehicles powered solely by electricity, including plug-in electric vehicles and solar-powered vehicles. Use good engineering judgment to apply these requirements to these vehicles, including applying these provisions to vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVWR. Electric heavy-duty vehicles may not generate NOX or PM emission credits. Heavy-duty vehicles powered solely by electricity are deemed to have zero emissions of regulated pollutants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The standards and requirements of this part applicable to diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles and engines apply to all other heavy-duty vehicles and engines not otherwise addressed in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> See 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 for requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Manufacturers may voluntarily certify to the standards of paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section before model year 2016. Note that other provisions in this part require compliance with the standards described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section for model years before 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Small volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines in its product line (including all vehicles and engines imported under the provisions of 40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509) are fewer than 10,000 units for the model year in which the manufacturer seeks certification. To certify its product line under these optional procedures, the small-volume manufacturer must first obtain the Administrator's approval. The manufacturer must meet the eligibility criteria specified in Sec. 86.098-14(b) before the Administrator's approval will be granted. The small-volume manufacturer's certification procedures are described in Sec. 86.098-14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Optional procedures for determining exhaust opacity. (1) The provisions of subpart I of this part apply to tests which are performed by the Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Measurement procedures, other than those described in subpart I of this part, may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer satisfies the requirements of Sec. 86.007-23(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement procedure, it has the responsibility to determine whether the results obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I of this part. Consequently, the Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove any alternative opacity

measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which the manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements for subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a confirmatory test is performed and the results indicate there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately correlate with data obtained in accordance with the procedures described in subpart I of this part, EPA may require that all certificates of conformity not already issued be based on data obtained from procedures described in subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversions. The provisions of this subpart also apply for clean alternative fuel conversions as defined in 40 CFR 85.502 of all vehicles described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Turbine engines. Turbine engines are deemed to be compression-ignition engines for purposes of this part.

Urban bus operation is characterized by short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation, more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, large luggage compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage. The useful life for urban buses is the same as the useful life for other heavy heavy-duty diesel engines.

The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i). However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter on the engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison.

Urban bus operation is characterized by short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation, more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens, rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, large luggage compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage. The useful life for urban buses is the same as the useful life for other heavy heavy-duty diesel engines.

Scheduled maintenance must be approved by the Administrator prior to being performed or being included in the maintenance instructions provided to purchasers under Sec. 86.087-38. The Administrator has determined that emission-related maintenance at shorter intervals than those outlined in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section is not technologically necessary to ensure in-use compliance.

The manufacturer must also include its recommendations as to the category (i.e., emission-related or non-emission-related, critical or non-critical) of the subject maintenance and, for suggested emission-related maintenance, the maximum feasible maintenance interval. Such requests must include detailed evidence supporting the need for the maintenance requested, and supporting data or other substantiation for the recommended maintenance category and for the interval suggested for emission-related maintenance. Requests for new scheduled maintenance must be approved prior to the introduction of the new maintenance. The Administrator will then designate the maintenance as emission-related or non-emission-related. For maintenance items established as emission-related, the Administrator will further designate the maintenance as critical if the component which receives the maintenance is a critical component under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
