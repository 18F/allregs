                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. The form  is posted on the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office  Web site, http://www.epa.gov/ceppo and the Toxics Release Inventory  Program Division Web site, http://www.epa.gov/tri. Submitters may also  contact the National Service Center for Environmental Publications  (NSCEP) at (800) 490-9198 or (513) 489-8190 to obtain the form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Substantiation form to accompany claims of trade secrecy.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.031     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.032     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.033     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.034     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC02AU92.035</p><p class="depth2">Instructions for Completing the EPA Trade Secret Substantiation Form</p><p class="depth2">General Information</p><p class="depth2">EPA requires that the information requested in a trade secret  substantiation be completed using this substantiation form in order to  ensure that all facility and chemical identifier information,  substantiation questions, and certification statements are completed.  Submitter-devised forms will not be accepted. Incomplete substantiations  will in all likelihood be found insufficient to support the claim, and  the claim will be denied. Moreover, the statute provides that a  submitter who fails to provide information required will be subject to a  $10,000 fine. For the submitter's own protection, therefore, the EPA  form must be used and completed in its entirety.</p><p class="depth2">The statute for section 322 establishes a two-phase process in which  the submitter must do the following:</p><p class="depth2">1. At the time a report is submitted, the submitter must present a  complete set of assertions that (if true) would be sufficient to justify  the claim of trade secrecy; and</p><p class="depth2">2. If the claim is reviewed by EPA, the submitter will be asked to  provide additional factual information sufficient to establish the  truthfulness of the assertions made at the time the claim was made.</p><p class="depth2">In making its assertions of trade secrecy, a submitter should  provide, where applicable, descriptive factual statements. Conclusory  statements of compliance (such as positive or negative restatements of  the questions) may not provide EPA with enough information to make a  determination and may be found insufficient to support a claim.</p><p class="depth2">What May Be Withheld</p><p class="depth2">Only the specific chemical identity required to be disclosed in  sections 303, 311, 312, and 313 submissions may be claimed trade secret  on the Title III submittal itself. (Other trade secret or confidential  business information included in answer to a question on the  substantiation may be claimed trade secret or confidential, as described  below.)</p><p class="depth2">Location information claimed as confidential under section  312(d)(2)(F) should not be sent to EPA; this should only be sent to the  SERC, LEPC, and the fire department, as requested.</p><p class="depth2">Sanitized and Unsanitized Copies</p><p class="depth2">You must submit this form to EPA in sanitized and unsanitized  versions, along with the sanitized and unsanitized copies of the  submittal that gives rise to this trade secrecy claim (except for the  section 303 submittal, and for MSDSs under section 311). The unsanitized  version of this form contains specific chemical identity and CAS number  and may contain other trade secret or confidential business information,  which should be clearly labeled as such. Failure to claim other  information trade secret or confidential will make that information  publicly available. In the sanitized version of this form, the specific  chemical identity and CAS number must be replaced with the chemical's  generic class or category and any other trade secret or confidential  business information should be deleted. You should also send sanitized  copies of the submittal and this form to relevant State and local  authorities.</p><p class="depth2">Each question on this form must be answered. Submitters are  encouraged to answer in the space provided. If you need more space to  answer a particular question, please use additional sheets. If you use  additional sheets, be sure to include the number (and if applicable, the  subpart) of the question being answered and write your facility's Dun  and Bradstreet Number on the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.</p><p class="depth2">When the Forms Must be Submitted</p><p class="depth2">The sanitized and unsanitized report forms and trade secret  substantiations must be submitted to EPA by the normal reporting  deadline for that section (e.g., section 313 submissions for any  calendar year must be submitted on or before July 1 of the following  year).</p><p class="depth2">Where To Send the Trade Secrecy Claim</p><p class="depth2">The address to send all trade secrecy claims is posted on the  following EPA Program Web sites, http://www.epa.gov/   ceppo and http://www.epa.gov/tri. This information can also be obtained  by contacting the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Hotline  at (800) 424-9346 or (703) 412-9810, TDD (800) 553-7672, http:// www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hotline/.</p><p class="depth2">Packaging of Claim(s)</p><p class="depth2">A completed section 322 claim package must include four items,  packaged in the following order:</p><p class="depth2">1. An unsanitized trade secret substantiation form.</p><p class="depth2">2. A sanitized trade secret substantiation form.</p><p class="depth2">3. An unsanitized 312 or 313 report (it is not necessary to create  an unsanitized section 303 submittal or MSDS for submission under  section 311).</p><p class="depth2">4. A sanitized (public) section 303, 311, 312, or 313 or report.</p><p class="depth2">It is important to securely fasten together (binder clip or rubber  band) each of the reporting forms and substantiations for the particular  chemical being claimed trade secret. This process will make it clear  that a claim is physically complete when submitted. When submitters  submit claims for more than one chemical, EPA requests that the four  parts associated with each chemical be assembled as a set and each set  for different chemicals be kept separate within the package sent to EPA.  Following these guidelines permits the Agency to make the appropriate  determinations of trade secrecy, and to make public only those portions  of each submittal required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2">How to Obtain Forms and Other Information</p><p class="depth2">Additional copies of the Trade Secret Substantiation Form may be  obtained by writing to: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know  Program, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, WH-562A, 1200  Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2">Instructions for Completing Specific Sections of the Form</p><p class="depth2">Part 1. Substantiation Category</p><p class="depth2">1.1 Title III Reporting Section. Check the box corresponding to the  section for which this particular claim of trade secrecy is being made.  Checking off more than one box for a claim is not permitted.</p><p class="depth2">1.2 Reporting Year. Enter the year to which the reported information  applies, not the year in which you are submitting the report.</p><p class="depth2">1.3a Sanitized. If this copy of the submission is the ``public'' or  sanitized version, check this box and complete 1.3.1a. which asks for  generic class or category. Do not complete the information required in  the unsanitized box (1.3b.).</p><p class="depth2">1.3.1a Generic Class or Category. You must complete this if you are  claiming the specific chemical identity as a trade secret and have  marked the box in 1.3a. The generic chemical name must be structurally  descriptive of the chemical.</p><p class="depth2">1.3b Unsanitized. Check the box if this version of the form contains  the specific chemical identity or any other trade secret or confidential  business information.</p><p class="depth2">1.3.1b CAS Number. You must enter the Chemical Abstract Service  (CAS) registry number that appears in the appropriate section of the  rule for the chemical being reported. Use leading place holding zeros.  If you are reporting a chemical category (e.g., copper compounds), enter  N/A in the CAS number space.</p><p class="depth2">1.3.2b Specific Chemical Identity. Enter the name of the chemical or  chemical category as it is listed in the appropriate section of the  reporting rule.</p><p class="depth2">Part 2. Facility Identification Information</p><p class="depth2">2.1-2.3 Facility Name and Location. You must enter the name of your  facility (plant site name or appropriate facility designation), street  address, city, State and ZIP Code in the space provided. You may not use  a post office box number for this location.</p><p class="depth2">2.4 Dun and Bradstreet Number. You must enter the number assigned by  Dun and Bradstreet for your facility or   each establishment within your facility. If the establishment does not  have a D & B number, enter N/A in the boxes reserved for those numbers.  Use leading place holding zeros.</p><p class="depth2">Part 3. Responses to Substantiation Questions</p><p class="depth2">The six questions posed in this form are based on the four statutory  criteria found in section 322(b) of Title III. The information you  submit in response to these questions is the basis for EPA's initial  determination as to whether the substantiation is sufficient to support  a claim of trade secrecy. EPA has indicated in Sec. 350.13 of the final  rule the specific criteria that it regards as the legal basis for  evaluating whether the answers you have provided are sufficient to  warrant protection of the chemical identity. You are urged to review  those criteria before preparing answers to the questions on the form.</p><p class="depth2">Part 4. Certification</p><p class="depth2">An original signature is required for each trade secret  substantiation submitted to EPA, both sanitized and unsanitized. It  indicates the submitter is certifying that the particular substantiation  provided to EPA is complete, true, and accurate, and that it is intended  to support the specific trade secret claim being made. Noncompliance  with this certification requirement may jeopardize the trade secret  claim.</p><p class="depth2">4.1 Name and Official Title. Print or type the name and title of the  person who signs the statement at 4.2.</p><p class="depth2">4.2 Signature. This certification must be signed by the owner or  operator, or a senior official with management responsibility for the  person (or persons) completing the form. An original signature is  required for each trade secret substantiation submitted to EPA, both  sanitized and unsanitized. Since the certification applies to all  information supplied on the forms, it should be signed only after the  substantiation has been completed.</p><p class="depth2">4.3 Date. Enter the date when the certification was signed.  [53 FR 28801, July 29, 1988, as amended at 68 FR 64724, Nov. 14, 2003]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 350--Restatement of Torts Section</p><p class="depth2">757, Comment b</p><p class="depth2">b. Definition of trade secret. A trade secret may consist of any  formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in  one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an  advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a  formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or  preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list  of customers. It differs from other secret information in a business  (see section 759) in that it is not simply information as to single or  ephemeral events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, the  amount or other terms of a secret bid for a contract or the salary of  certain employees, or the security investments made or contemplated, or  the date fixed for the announcement of a new policy or for bringing out  a new model or the like. A trade secret is a process or device for  continuous use in the operation of the business. Generally it relates to  the production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the  production of an article. It may, however, relate to the sale of goods  or to other operations in the business, such as a code for determining  discounts, rebates or other concessions in a price list or catalogue, or  a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeeping or other  office management.</p><p class="depth2">Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret.  Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry  cannot be appropriated by one as his secret. Matters which are  completely disclosed by the goods which one markets cannot be his  secret. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular  business in which it is used. It is not requisite that only the  proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losing his  protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He may  likewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also  know of it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the  process or formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret.  Nevertheless, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that,  except by the use of improper means, there would be difficulty in  acquiring the information. An exact definition of a trade secret is not  possible. Some factors to be considered in determining whether given  information is one's trade secret are: (1) The extent to which the  information is known outside of his business; (2) the extent to which it  is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the  extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information;  (4) the value of the information to him and to his competitors; (5) the  amount of effort or   money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or  difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or  duplicated by others.</p><p class="depth2">Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process  which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or  process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is  merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty  and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for  patentability. These requirements are essential to patentability because  a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or  process even by one who discovers it properly through independent  research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is  not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not based on a  policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secret  processes or devices. The protection is merely against breach of faith  and reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limited  protection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty and  invention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the  secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of  relief that is appropriate against one who is subject to liability under  the rule stated in this section. Thus, if the secret consists of a  device or process which is a novel invention, one who acquires the  secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is  required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on  the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a  good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer's  liability may be limited to damages, and an injunction against future  use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be  inappropriate.
