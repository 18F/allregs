                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible lenders. Eligible lenders may participate in the loan guarantee program. These lenders must be subject to credit examination and supervision by an appropriate agency of the United States or a State that supervises and regulates credit institutions. A lender must have the capability to adequately service loans for which a guarantee is requested. Eligible lenders are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Federal or State chartered bank or savings and loan association;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any mortgage company that is a part of a bank holding company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Co-Bank, National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, Farm Credit Bank of the Federal Land Bank, or other Farm Credit System institution with direct lending authority authorized to make loans of the type guaranteed by this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An insurance company regulated by a State or National insurance regulatory agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State Bond Banks or State Bond Pools; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other lenders that possess the legal powers necessary and incidental to making and servicing guaranteed loans involving community development-type projects. Lenders under this category must be approved by the National Office prior to the issuance of the loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conflict of interest. When the lender's officers, stockholders, directors, or partners (including their immediate families) or the borrower, its officers, stockholders, directors, or partners (including their immediate families) own, or have management responsibilities in each other, the lender must disclose such business or ownership relationships. The Agency will determine if such relationships are likely to result in a conflict of interest. This does not preclude lender officials from being on the borrower's board of directors.</p>
