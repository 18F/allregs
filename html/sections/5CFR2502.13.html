                                Sec. 2502.13  Fees to be charged--categories of requestors.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">There are four categories of FOIA requestors: commercial use  requestors educational and non-commercial scientific institutions;  representatives of the news media; and all other requestors. The  specific levels of fees for each of these categories are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial use requestors. When OA receives a request for  documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the  full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and  duplicating the record sought. Requestors must reasonably   describe the records sought. Commercial use requestors are not entitled  to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of  documents. OA may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing  records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see  Sec. 2502.14).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Educational and non-commercial scientific institution  requestors. OA shall provide documents to requestors in this category  for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100  pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requestors must  show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the  auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought  for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly if the  request is from an education institution) or scientific (if the request  is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requestors  must reasonably describe the records sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requestors who are representatives of the news media. OA shall  provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of  reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be  eligible for inclusion in this category, a requestor must meet the  criteria in Sec. 2502.11(j), and his or her request must not be made for  commercial use. In reference to this class of requestors a request for  records supporting the news dissemination function of the requestor  shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.  Requestors must reasonably describe the records sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All other requestors. OA shall charge requestors who do not fit  into any of the categories above fees that recover the full, reasonable,  direct cost of searching for and reproducing the records that are  responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages and the first  two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Moreover,  requests for records about the requestors filed in OA's system of  records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the  Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. Requestors  must reasonably describe the records sought.  [56 FR 5742, Feb. 13, 1991]</p>
