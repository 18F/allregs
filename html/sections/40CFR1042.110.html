                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engines equipped with SCR systems using a reductant other than  the engine's fuel must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The diagnostic system must monitor reductant quality and tank  levels and alert operators to the need to refill the reductant tank  before it is empty, or to replace the reductant if it does not meet your  concentration specifications. Unless we approve other alerts, use a  malfunction-indicator light (MIL) and an audible alarm. You do not need  to separately monitor reductant quality if you include an exhaust  NOX sensor (or other sensor) that allows you to determine  inadequate reductant quality. However, tank level must be monitored in  all cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The onboard computer log must record in nonvolatile computer  memory all incidents of engine operation with inadequate reductant  injection or reductant quality. Use good engineering judgment to ensure  that the operator can readily access the information to submit the  report required by Sec.  1042.660. For example, you may meet this  requirement by documenting the incident in a text file that can be  downloaded or printed by the operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SCR systems must also conform to the provisions of paragraph (d)  of this section if they are equipped with on-off controls as allowed  under Sec.  1042.115(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you determine your emission controls have failure modes that  may reasonably be expected to affect safety, equip the engines with  diagnostic features that will alert the operator to such failures. Use  good engineering judgment to alert the operator before the failure  occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may equip your engine with other diagnostic features. If you  do, they must be designed to allow us to read and interpret the codes.  Note that Sec. Sec.  1042.115 and 1042.205 require that you provide us  any information needed to read, record, and interpret all the  information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic  control units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, use  good engineering judgment to integrate diagnostic features to comply  with both paragraphs.  [73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 22998, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
