The forms shall be submitted within 10 days after the end of the month in which the merchandise was received in the zone, and no extension beyond that time will be approved by the port director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General order.

A discrepancy involving a within-case shortage (or overage) need not be reported on Customs Form 5931, if the operator is able to report that information in another manner so that the port director can determine whether there is liability for the discrepancy under the bond of any party to the importation.
