The allowance of such deferment and the duration thereof shall be in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge after consideration of the nature of the proceeding, the requirments of the public interest, the representations of the parties, and the probability of an agreement being reached which will result in a just disposition of the issues involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content.
