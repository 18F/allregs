                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The neck assembly for the purposes of this test consists of the assembly of components shown in drawing 420-2000 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 572.170).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When the head-neck assembly consisting of the head (drawing 420-1000), neck (drawing 420-2000), six-channel neck transducer (SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000), lower neck bracket assembly (drawing 420-2070), and either three uniaxial accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4, included in drawing 420-0000) or their mass equivalent installed in the head assembly as specified in drawing 420-1000 (all incorporated by reference, see Sec. 572.170), is tested according to the test

procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Flexion. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure T2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 76 degrees and 90 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 572.170), about the occipital condyles may not be less than 50 N-m (36.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 62 N-m (45.7 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m (7.4 ft-lbf) between 86 ms and 105 ms after time zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My - (0.01778) x (FX).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> My is the moment about the y-axis in Newton-meters, FX is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) in Newtons, and 0.01778 is the distance in meters from the load center of the neck transducer to the occipital condyle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extension. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure T3, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 96 degrees and 115 degrees.
