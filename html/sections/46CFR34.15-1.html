Installations contracted for prior to January 1, 1962, shall meet the  requirements of Sec. 34.15-90.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of this subpart are based on a ``high pressure  system,'' i.e., one in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form  at atmospheric temperature. Details for ``low pressure systems,'' i.e.,  those in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form at a  continuously controlled low temperature, may be specifically approved by  the Commandant where it is demonstrated that a comparable degree of  safety and fire extinguishing ability is achieved.</p>
