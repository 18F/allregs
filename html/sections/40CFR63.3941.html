                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You may use the compliant material option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the emission rate without add-on controls option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the compliant material option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must use no coating with an organic HAP content that exceeds the applicable emission limits in Sec. 63.3890 and must use no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contains organic HAP as determined according to this section. Any coating operation for which you use the compliant material option is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards required in Sec. Sec. 63.3892 and 63.3893, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each general use, high performance, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, and extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operation unless you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in Sec. 63.3890(c). If you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in Sec. 63.3890(c), you must demonstrate that all coating operations included in the predominant activity determination or calculation of the facility-specific emission limit comply with that limit. You must meet all the requirements of this section. Use the procedures in this section on each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material in the condition it is in when it is received from its manufacturer or supplier and prior to any alteration. You do not need to redetermine the organic HAP content of coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials that are reclaimed on-site (or reclaimed off-site if you have documentation showing that you received back the exact same materials that were sent off-site) and reused in the coating operation for which you use the compliant material option, provided these materials in their condition as received were demonstrated to comply with the compliant material option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material used. You must determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when performing a Method 311 test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Count each organic HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you count as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (e.g., 0.3791).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the total mass fraction of organic HAP in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP mass fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (e.g., 0.763).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). For coatings, you may use

Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may use the alternative method contained in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, rather than Method 24. You may use the volatile fraction that is emitted, as measured by the alternative method in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, as a substitute for the mass fraction of organic HAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may rely on manufacturer's data that expressly states the organic HAP or volatile matter mass fraction emitted. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Solvent blends. Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some materials in data provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP mass fraction of the materials. When test data and manufacturer's data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the default values for the mass fraction of organic HAP in these solvent blends listed in Table 3 or 4 to this subpart. If you use the tables, you must use the values in Table 3 for all solvent blends that match Table 3 entries according to the instructions for Table 3, and you may use Table 4 only if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 3 and you know only whether the blend is aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the results of a Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63) test indicate higher values than those listed on Table 3 or 4 to this subpart, the Method 311 results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. You must determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liters (gal) of coating solids per liter (gal) of coating) for each coating used during the compliance period by a test, by information provided by the supplier or the manufacturer of the material, or by calculation, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. If test results obtained according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not agree with the information obtained under paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ASTM Method D2697-86 (Reapproved 1998) or ASTM Method D6093-97 (Reapproved 2003). You may use ASTM Method D2697-86 (Reapproved 1998), ``Standard Test Method for Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), or ASTM Method D6093-97 (Reapproved 2003), ``Standard Test Method for Percent Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings Using a Helium Gas Pycnometer'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to

calculate volume fraction of coating solids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for determining the solids content of each coating once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculation of volume fraction of coating solids. You may determine the volume fraction of coating solids using Equation 1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA04.003
Where:
Vs = Volume fraction of coating solids, liters (gal) coating</p><p class="depth3">solids per liter (gal) coating.mvolatiles = Total volatile matter content of the coating,</p><p class="depth3">including HAP, volatile organic compounds (VOC), water, and</p><p class="depth3">exempt compounds, determined according to Method 24 in</p><p class="depth3">appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, grams volatile matter per liter</p><p class="depth3">coating.Davg = Average density of volatile matter in the coating,</p><p class="depth3">grams volatile matter per liter volatile matter, determined</p><p class="depth3">from test results using ASTM Method D1475-98, ``Standard Test</p><p class="depth3">Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related</p><p class="depth3">Products'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14),</p><p class="depth3">information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material,</p><p class="depth3">or reference sources providing density or specific gravity</p><p class="depth3">data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM</p><p class="depth3">Method D1475-98 test results and other information sources,</p><p class="depth3">the test results will take precedence unless, after</p><p class="depth3">consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the</p><p class="depth3">enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine the density of each coating. Determine the density of each coating used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM Method D1475-98, ``Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or specific gravity data for pure chemicals. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-98 test results and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determine the organic HAP content of each coating. Calculate the organic HAP content, kg (lb) of organic HAP emitted per liter (gal) coating solids used, of each coating used during the compliance period using Equation 2 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA04.004
Where:
Hc = Organic HAP content of the coating, kg organic HAP</p><p class="depth2">emitted per liter (gal) coating solids used.Dc = Density of coating, kg coating per liter (gal) coating,</p><p class="depth2">determined according to paragraph (c) of this section.Wc = Mass fraction of organic HAP in the coating, kg organic</p><p class="depth2">HAP per kg coating, determined according to paragraph (a) of</p><p class="depth2">this section.Vs = Volume fraction of coating solids, liter (gal) coating</p><p class="depth2">solids per liter (gal) coating, determined according to</p><p class="depth2">paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance demonstration. The calculated organic HAP content for each coating used during the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3890; and each thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during the initial compliance period must contain no organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep all records required by Sec. Sec. 63.3930 and 63.3931. As part of the notification of compliance status required in Sec. 63.3910, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3890, and you used no thinners and/

or other additives, or cleaning materials that contained organic HAP, determined according to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
