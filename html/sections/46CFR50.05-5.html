with the regulations in this subchapter in effect at the time such reboilering work is contracted for. The existing steam piping shall be examined. Those portions which are in good condition and comply with minimum thickness requirements in effect at the time such reboilering work is contracted for may be continued in service. The steam piping replaced shall be in accordance with the regulations in this subchapter in effect for new construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purpose of this section, existing equipment includes only items which have previously met all Coast Guard requirements for installation aboard a vessel certificated by the Coast Guard, including requirements for design, fabrication, testing, and inspection at the time the equipment was new.
