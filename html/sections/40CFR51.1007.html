                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For any area designated as nonattainment for the PM2.5 NAAQS, the State must submit an attainment demonstration showing that the area will attain the annual and 24-hour standards as expeditiously as practicable. The demonstration must meet the requirements of Sec. 51.112 and Appendix W of this part and must include inventory data, modeling results, and emission reduction analyses on which the State has based its projected attainment date. The attainment date justified by the demonstration must be consistent with the requirements of Sec. 51.1004(a). The modeled strategies must be consistent with requirements in Sec. 51.1009 for RFP and in Sec. 51.1010 for RACT and RACM. The attainment demonstration and supporting air quality modeling should be consistent with EPA's PM2.5 modeling guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required time frame for obtaining emissions reductions. For each nonattainment area, the State implementation plan must provide for implementation of all control measures needed for attainment as expeditiously as

practicable, but no later than the beginning of the year prior to the attainment date. Consistent with section 172(c)(1) of the Act, the plan must provide for implementation of all RACM and RACT as expeditiously as practicable. The plan also must include RFP milestones in accordance with Sec. 51.1009, and control measures needed to meet these milestones, as necessary.</p>
