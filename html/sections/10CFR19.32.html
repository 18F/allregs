                            <p class="depth0">No person shall on the grounds of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied a license, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity carried on which is under the jurisdiction of the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or under any title of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. This provision will be enforced through agency provisions and regulations similar to those already established, with respect to racial and other discrimination, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This remedy is not exclusive, however, and will not prejudice or cut off any

other legal remedies available to a discriminatee.
