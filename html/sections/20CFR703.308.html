                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A self-insurer may not substitute other security for any indemnity bond or letters of credit deposited under the regulations in this part except when authorized by the Office. A self-insurer may, however, substitute negotiable securities acceptable under the regulations in this part for previously-deposited negotiable securities without the Office's prior approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A self-insurer discontinuing business, discontinuing operations within the purview of the Act, or securing the payment of compensation by commercial insurance under the provisions of the Act may apply to the Office for the withdrawal of the security it provided under the regulations in this part. The self-insurer must file with its application a sworn statement setting forth--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of all cases in each compensation district in which the self-insurer is paying compensation, together with the names of the employees and other beneficiaries, a description of causes of injury or death, and a statement of the amount of compensation paid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A similar list of all pending cases in which the self-insurer has not yet paid compensation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A similar list of all cases in which injury or death has occurred within one year before such application or in which the last payment of compensation was made within one year before such application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Office may authorize withdrawal of previously-deposited indemnity bonds, letters of credit and negotiable securities that, in the opinion of the Office, are not necessary to provide adequate security for the payment of the self-insurer's outstanding and potential LHWCA obligations. No withdrawals will be authorized unless there has been no claim activity involving the self-insurer for a minimum of five years, and the Office is reasonably certain no further claims will arise.</p>
