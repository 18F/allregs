Due to the different speeds at which vessels of different sizes and configurations may travel while in compliance with this definition, no specific speed is assigned to minimum safe speed. In no instance should minimum safe speed be interpreted as a speed less than that required for a particular vessel to maintain steerageway. A vessel is not proceeding at minimum safe speed if it is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On a plane;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the process of coming up onto or coming off a plane; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Creating an excessive wake or surge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Regulated area.
