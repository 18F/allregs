                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pursuant to 8 CFR part 1003, an appeal shall lie from a decision of an immigration judge to the Board, except that no appeal shall lie from an order of deportation entered in absentia. The procedures regarding the filing of a Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, fees, and briefs are set forth in Sec. Sec. 1003.3, 1003.31, and 1003.38 of this chapter. An appeal shall be filed within 30 calendar days after the mailing of a written decision, the stating of an oral decision, or the service of a summary decision. The filing date is defined as the date of receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the Board. The reasons for the appeal shall be stated in the Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1003.3(b) of this chapter. Failure to do so may constitute a ground for dismissal of the appeal by the Board pursuant to Sec. 1003.1(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibited appeals; legalization or applications. An alien respondent defined in Sec. 245a.2(c)(6) or (7) of this chapter who fails to file an application for adjustment of status to that of a temporary resident within the prescribed period(s), and who is thereafter found to be deportable by decision of an immigration judge, shall not be permitted to appeal the finding of deportability based solely on refusal by the immigration judge to entertain such an application in deportation proceedings.
