                            <p class="depth0">The following conditions of equilibrium are regarded as  satisfactory:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Downflooding. The final waterline after flooding, taking into  account sinkage, heel, and trim, is below the lower edge of any opening  through which progressive flooding can take place. Such openings include  air pipes, ventilators, and openings which are closed by means of  weathertight doors (even if they comply with Sec. 42.15-10) or covers  (even if they comply with Sec. 42.15-30 or Sec. 42.15-45(d)) but may  exclude those openings closed by means of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manhole covers and flush scuttles which comply with Sec. 42.15- 40;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cargo hatch covers which comply with Sec. 42.09-5(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hinged watertight doors in an approved position which are  secured closed while at sea and so logged; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remotely operated sliding watertight doors, and side scuttles of  the non-opening type which comply with Sec. 42.15-65.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, progressive flooding cannot extend to compartments  other than those assumed to be floodable in the calculation for each  case of damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final angle of heel. The angle of heel due to unsymmetrical  flooding does not exceed 15 degrees. If no part of the deck is immersed,  an angle of heel of up to 17 degrees may be accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Metacentric height. The metacentric height of the damaged  vessel, in the upright condition, is positive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Residual stability. Through an angle of 20 degrees beyond its  position of equilibrium, the vessel must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The righting arm must be positive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum righting arm must be at least 0.1 meter (4 inches).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The area under the righting arm curve within the 20 degree range  must   not be less than 0.0175 meter-radians (0.689 inch-radians).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each submerged opening must be weathertight (e.g. a vent fitted  with a ball check valve).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Intermediate stages of flooding. The Commandant is satisfied  that the stability is sufficient during intermediate stages of flooding.  [CGD 79-153, 48 FR 38649, Aug. 25, 1983]</p>
