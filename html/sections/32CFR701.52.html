For example, although we calculate correspondence and preparation costs, these fees are not recoupable from the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DD 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing Cost, should be filled out accurately to reflect all processing costs, as requesters may solicit a copy of that document to ensure accurate computation of fees. Costs shall be computed on time actually spent. Neither time-based nor dollar-based minimum charges for search, review and duplication are authorized.</p>
