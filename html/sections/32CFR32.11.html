                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Use of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. (1) OMB Circular A-110 states that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-6308) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. Under that Act:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In selecting the appropriate award instruments, DoD Components' grants officers shall comply with the DoD implementation of the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act at 32 CFR part 22, subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Public notice and priority setting. As a matter of Governmentwide policy, Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of intended funding priorities for programs that use discretionary awards, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute. For DoD Components, compliance with competition policies and statutory requirements implemented in 32 CFR part 22, subpart C, shall constitute compliance with this Governmentwide policy.
