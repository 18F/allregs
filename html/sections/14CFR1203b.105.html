                            <p class="depth0">When a security force personnel has the right to make an arrest, as  discussed in Sec. 1203b.103, the officer may use only that non-deadly  physical force which is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest  the offender; to prevent the escape of the offender; or to defend  himself/herself or a third person from what the security force officer  reasonably believes to be the use or threat of imminent use of non- deadly physical force by the offender. Verbal abuse alone by the  offender cannot be the basis under any circumstances for use of non- deadly physical force by a security force officer.
