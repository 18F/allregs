The Instructions may exempt  categories of employment from prior approval requirement of this section  based on a determination that employment within those categories of  employment would generally be approved and is not likely to involve  conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR  part 2635. The DAEO may include in these Instructions examples of  outside employment that are permissible or impermissible consistent with  this part and 5 CFR part 2635, including examples of other credit union- related entities.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 9602	9699 [RESERVED]</p>
