Copies of the list will also be available via postal mail, fax, or email upon request to the Sanitary Trade Issues Team, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> APHIS will add a region to the list of those it has declared free of classical swine fever after it conducts an evaluation of the region in accordance with Sec. 92.2 of this subchapter and finds that the disease is not present. In the case of a region formerly on this list that is removed due to an outbreak, the region may be returned to the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in Sec. 92.4 of this subchapter. APHIS will remove a region from the list of those it has declared free of classical swine fever upon determining that the disease exists in the region based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The APHIS-defined European CSF region is a single region of low-risk for CSF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 94.31 for the APHIS-defined European CSF region, no fresh pork or pork product may be imported into the United States from any region where classical swine fever is known to exist unless it complies with the following requirements: \9\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\9\ See also other provisions of this part and parts 93, 95, and 96 of this chapter, and part 327 of this title, for other prohibitions and restrictions upon the importation of swine and swine products.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such pork or pork product has been treated in accordance with one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such pork and pork product has been fully cooked by a commercial method in a container hermetically sealed promptly after filling but before such cooking, so that such cooking and sealing produced a fully sterilized product which is shelf-stable without refrigeration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such pork or pork product is in compliance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All bones were completely removed prior to cooking; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such pork or pork product was heated by other than a flash-heating method to an internal temperature of 69 [deg]C.

In accordance with the terms of the cooperative service agreement, before the APHIS representative's site inspection, the operator of the processing establishment or the party acting on their behalf must deposit with the Administrator an amount equal to the approximate cost of one inspection by an APHIS representative, including travel, salary, subsistence, administrative overhead, and other incidental expenses, including excess baggage up to 150 pounds. As funds from that amount are obligated, a bill for costs incurred based on official accounting records will be issued to restore the deposit to the original level, revised as necessary to allow for inflation or other changes in estimated costs. To be current, bills must be paid within 14 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Shipment to the United States. Uncooked pork or pork products to be imported into the United States must be shipped from the region where they were processed in closed containers sealed with serially numbered seals applied by an official of the national government of that region. The shipments must be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official of the national government of the region where the pork or pork products were processed that lists the numbers of the seals applied and states that all of the conditions of this paragraph (e) have been met. The certificate shall also state that the container seals specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section were found by an official of the region's national government to be intact and free of any evidence of tampering on arrival at the processing establishment in the CSF-affected region. A copy of this certificate must be kept on file at the processing establishment for at least 2 years.
