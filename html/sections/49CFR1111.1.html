                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A formal complaint must contain the correct,  unabbreviated names and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It  should set forth briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it  is based. It should include specific reference to pertinent statutory  provisions and Board regulations, and should advise the Board and the  defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations have  been violated. The complaint should contain a detailed statement of the  relief requested. Relief in the alternative or of several different  types may be demanded, but the issues raised in the formal complaint  should not be broader than those to which complainant's evidence is to  be directed at the hearing. In a complaint challenging the  reasonableness of a rail rate, the complainant should indicate whether,  in its view, the reasonableness of the rate should be examined using  constrained market pricing or using the simplified standards adopted  pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10701(d)(3). If the complainant seeks to use the  simplified standards, it should support this request by submitting, at a  minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The carrier or region identifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of shipment (local, received-terminated, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The one-way distance of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The type of car (by URCS code).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number of cars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The car ownership (private or railroad).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The commodity type (STCC code).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The weight of the shipment (in tons per car).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The type of movement (individual, multi-car, or unit train).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A narrative addressing whether there is any feasible  transportation alternative for the challenged movements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> For matters for which voluntary, binding arbitration is  available pursuant to 49 CFR part 1108, the complaint shall state that  arbitration was considered, but rejected, as a means of resolving the  dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure with simplified standards complaint. The complainant  must provide to the defendant all documents relied upon in formulating  its assessment of a feasible transportation alternative and all  documents relied upon to determine the inputs to the URCS Phase III  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiple causes of action. Two or more grounds of complaint  concerning the same principle, subject, or statement of facts may be  included in one complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joinder. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint  against   one or more defendants if their respective causes of action concern  substantially the same alleged violations and like facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request for access to waybill data. Parties needing access to  the Waybill Sample to prepare their case should follow the procedures  set forth at 49 CFR 1244.8.  [61 FR 52711, Oct. 8, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 2639, Jan. 16, 1998; 67  FR 36822, May 28, 2002; 72 FR 51375, Sept. 7, 2007]</p>
