In cases where a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, such class of stock meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the calendar year of the offering if the stock is regularly traded on such exchanges or markets, other than in de minimis quantities, on the greater of \1/6\ of the days remaining in the quarter in which the offering occurs, or 5 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Anti-abuse rule.

Similarly, paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to a public offering of stock that has as

one of its principal purposes to avail itself of the reduced trading requirements under the special rule for the calendar year of an initial public offering. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, consideration will be given to whether the trading requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied in the subsequent calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified exchange or other market--(1) General rule.
