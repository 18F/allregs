                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State shall submit its enforcement plan or annual update to the FHWA Division Office by July 1 of each year. However, if a State's legislative or budgetary cycle is not consonant with that date, the FHWA and the State may jointly select an alternate date. In any event, a State must have an approved plan in effect by October 1 of each year. Failure of a State to submit or update a plan will result in the State being unable to certify in accordance with Sec. 657.13 for the period to be covered by the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FHWA shall review the State's operation under the accepted plan on a continuing basis and shall prepare an evaluation report annually. The State will be advised of the results of the evaluation and of any needed changes in the plan itself or in its implementation. Copies of the evaluation reports and subsequent modifications resulting from the evaluation shall be forwarded to the FHWA's Office of Operations.
