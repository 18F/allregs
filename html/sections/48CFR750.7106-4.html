                            <p class="depth0">Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances  to permit payment to persons who have taken action without a formal  contract; for example, where any person, pursuant to written or oral  instructions from an officer or official of the Agency and relying in  good faith upon the apparent authority of the officer or official to  issue such instructions, has arranged to furnish or has furnished  property or services to the agency and/or to a foreign assistance  contractor or subcontractor without formal contractual coverage for such  property or services. Formalization of commitments under such  circumstances normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the  United States by assuring persons that they will be treated fairly and  paid expeditiously.</p>
