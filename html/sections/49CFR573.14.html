                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An accelerated remedy program is one in which the manufacturer  expands the sources of replacement parts needed to remedy the defect or  noncompliance, or expands the number of authorized repair facilities  beyond those facilities that usually and customarily provide remedy work  for the manufacturer, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may require a manufacturer to accelerate its  remedy program if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator finds that there is a risk of serious injury  or death if the remedy program is not accelerated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator finds that acceleration of the remedy program  can be reasonably achieved by expanding   the sources of replacement parts, expanding the number of authorized  repair facilities, or both; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator determines that the manufacturer's remedy  program is not likely to be capable of completion within a reasonable  time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, information from the manufacturer, information from  other manufacturers and suppliers, information from any source related  to the availability and implementation of the remedy, and the  seriousness of the risk of injury or death associated with the defect or  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As required by the Administrator, an accelerated remedy program  shall include the manner of acceleration (expansion of the sources of  replacement parts, expansion of the number of authorized repair  facilities, or both), may require submission of a plan, may identify the  parts to be provided and/or the sources of those parts, may require the  manufacturer to notify the agency and owners about any differences among  different sources or brands of parts, may require the manufacturer to  identify additional authorized repair facilities, and may specify  additional owner notifications related to the program. The Administrator  may also require the manufacturer to include a program to provide  reimbursement to owners who incur costs to obtain the accelerated  remedy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under an accelerated remedy program, the remedy that is provided  shall be equivalent to the remedy that would have been provided if the  manufacturer's remedy program had not been accelerated. The replacement  parts used to remedy the defect or noncompliance shall be reasonably  equivalent to those that would have been used if the remedy program were  not accelerated. The service procedures shall be reasonably equivalent.  In the case of tires, all replacement tires shall be the same size and  type as the defective or noncompliant tire, shall be suitable for use on  the owner's vehicle, shall have the same or higher load index and speed  rating, and, for passenger car tires, shall have the same or better  rating in each of the three categories enumerated in the Uniform Tire  Quality Grading System. See 49 CFR 575.104. In the case of child  restraints systems, all replacements shall be of the same type (e.g.,  rear-facing infant seats with a base, rear-facing infant seats without a  base, convertible seats (designed for use in both rear- and forward- facing modes), forward-facing only seats, high back booster seats with a  five-point harness, and belt positioning booster seats) and the same  overall quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section. Under these circumstances, the  accelerated remedy program shall include, to the extent required by the  Administrator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the remedy and costs that are eligible for  reimbursement, including identification of the equipment and/or parts  and labor for which reimbursement is available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification, with specificity or as a class, of the  alternative repair facilities at which reimbursable repairs may be  performed, including an explanation of how to arrange for service at  those facilities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other provisions assuring appropriate reimbursement that are  consistent with those set forth in Sec. 573.13, including, but not  limited to, provisions regarding the procedures and needed documentation  for making a claim for reimbursement, the amount of costs to be  reimbursed, the office to which claims for reimbursement shall be  submitted, the requirements on manufacturers for acting on claims for  reimbursement, and the methods by which owners can obtain information  about the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In response to a manufacturer's request, the Administrator may  authorize a manufacturer to terminate its accelerated remedy program if  the Administrator concludes that the manufacturer can meet all future  demands for the remedy through its own sources in a prompt manner. If  required by the Administrator, the manufacturer shall provide notice of  the termination of the program to all owners of unremedied vehicles and  equipment at least 30 days in advance of the termination date, in a form  approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each manufacturer shall implement any accelerated remedy program  required by the Administrator according to the terms of that program.
