                                Sec. 120.180  Lender and CDC compliance with Loan Program Requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Lenders must comply and maintain familiarity with Loan Program  Requirements for the 7(a) program, as such requirements are revised from  time to time. CDCs must comply and maintain familiarity with Loan  Program Requirements for the 504 program, as such requirements are  revised from time to time. Loan Program Requirements in effect at the  time that a Lender or CDC takes an action in connection with a  particular loan govern that specific action. For example, although loan  closing requirements in effect when a Lender or CDC closes a loan will  govern the closing actions, a Lender or CDC's liquidation actions on the  same loan are subject to the liquidation requirements in effect at the  time that a liquidation action is taken.
