                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to increases based on cost of living (see Sec.  826.6), attorney fees in some or all of the proceedings covered by this  part may also be increased beyond the statutory cap of $75 if warranted  by special factors (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified  to handle certain types of proceedings). The Board will conduct any  rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking  procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person may file with the Board a petition for rulemaking to  increase the maximum rate for attorney fees by demonstrating that a  special factor(s) justifies a higher fee. The petition shall identify  the rate the petitioner believes the Board should establish and the  proceeding(s) or types of proceedings in which the rate should be used.  It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is  warranted. The Board will respond to the petition within 60 days after  it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the  petition, or taking other appropriate action.
