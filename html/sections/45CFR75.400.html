                            <p class="depth0">The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental  premises that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The non-Federal entity is responsible for the efficient and  effective administration of the Federal award through the application of  sound management practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The non-Federal entity assumes responsibility for administering  Federal funds in a manner consistent with underlying agreements, program  objectives, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The non-Federal entity, in recognition of its own unique  combination of staff, facilities, and experience, has the primary  responsibility for employing whatever form of sound organization and  management techniques may be necessary in order to assure proper and  efficient administration of the Federal-award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The application of these cost principles should require no  significant changes in the internal accounting policies and practices of  the non-Federal entity. However, the accounting practices of the non- Federal entity must be consistent with these cost principles and support  the accumulation of costs as required by the principles, and must  provide for adequate documentation to support costs charged to the  Federal award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In reviewing, negotiating and approving cost allocation plans or  indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for indirect costs should  generally assure that the non-Federal entity is applying these cost  accounting principles on a consistent basis during their review and  negotiation of indirect cost proposals. Where wide variations exist in  the treatment of a given cost item by the non-Federal entity, the  reasonableness and equity of such treatments should be fully considered.  See Sec. 75.2 Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A;)) costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For non-Federal entities that educate and engage students in  research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees  (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion  of Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of  these principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The non-Federal entity may not earn or keep any profit resulting  from Federal financial assistance, unless explicitly authorized by the  terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also Sec. 75.307.</p>
