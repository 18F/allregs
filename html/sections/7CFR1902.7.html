                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Funds in excess of the maximum amount insurable by the Federal  government, per financial institution, deposited for borrowers in  supervised bank accounts, must be secured by pledging acceptable  collateral with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in an amount not less  than the excess. If the supervised bank account is a joint account, any  amount over the maximum amount insurable by the federal government must  be collateralized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As soon as it is determined that the loan will be approved and  the applicant has selected or tentatively selected a financial  institution for the supervised bank account, the Servicing Official will  contact the financial institution to determine:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the financial institution selected is insured by the FDIC  (banks and savings associations) or NCUA (credit unions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the financial institution is willing to pledge  collateral with the FRB under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176) to  the extent necessary to secure the amount of funds being deposited in  excess of the FDIC or NCUA insurance limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the financial institution is not a member of the Federal  Reserve System, it will be necessary for the financial institution to  pledge the securities with a correspondent bank who is a member of the  System. The correspondent bank should contact the FRB informing them  they are holding securities pledged for the supervised bank account  under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the financial institution agrees to pledge collateral, the  Servicing Official should complete RD Form Letter 1902-A-2, ``Designated  Financial Institution--Collateral Pledge'', in an original and two  copies: The original for the National Office, Policy and Analysis  Division; the first copy for the State Office; and the second copy for  the Servicing Official. The Rural Development Form Letter 1902-A-2  should be forwarded to the National Office, Policy and Analysis  Division, at least 30 days before the date of loan closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, will arrange  for the financial institution under its designation as a depository and  financial agent of the U.S. Government to pledge the requested  collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If, two days before loan closing, the local Rural Development  office which requested the collateral has not received notification from  the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, that collateral has  been pledged, contact should be made with the financial institution to  ascertain whether they have pledged collateral with their local FRB  under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176). If the financial  institution has pledged collateral, the local Rural Development office  should contact the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, who  will follow-up with the local FRB concerning the collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the amount of deposit in the supervised bank account has  been reduced to a point where the financial institution desires part or  all of the collateral released, it should contact the National Office,  Policy and Analysis Division. The local Rural Development office will be  contacted for release authorization. The authorization release will be  made through the local FRB, with notification to the financial  institution. The local Rural Development office may also request release  through the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division.
