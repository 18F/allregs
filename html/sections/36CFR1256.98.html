USIA audiovisual records prepared for dissemination abroad that NARA determines do not have copyright protection nor contain copyrighted material are available for examination and copying as described in the regulations in parts 1252, 1253, 1254, 1256, and 1258 of this chapter. To determine whether materials have copyright protection or contain copyrighted material, NARA relies on information contained within or fastened to individual records (for example, copyright notices); information contained within relevant USIA production, title, or other files that USIA transferred to NARA; information provided by requesters under Sec. 1256.100(b) (for example, evidence from the Copyright Office that copyright has lapsed or expired); and information provided by copyright or license holders.</p>
