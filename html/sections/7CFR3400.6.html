                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Within the limit of funds available for such purpose,  the awarding official shall make research project grants to those  responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most  meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria  and procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the  Director as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than  September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved  for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless  otherwise permitted by law. All funds granted under this part shall be  expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in  accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of  this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal  cost principles, and 2 CFR part 20 (part 3015 of this title).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant award document and notice of grant award--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant award  document. The grant award document shall include at a minimum the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Legal name and address of performing organization or institution  to whom the Director has awarded a special research project grant under  the terms of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Title of project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name(s) and address(es) of principal investigator(s) chosen to  direct and control approved activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identifying grant number assigned by the Department;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Project period, which specifies how long the Department intends  to support the effort without requiring recompetition for funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Total amount of Departmental financial assistance approved by  the Director during the project period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Legal authority(ies) under which the research project grant is  awarded to accomplish the purpose of the law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Approved budget plan for categorizing allocable project funds  to accomplish the stated purpose of the research project grant award;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Other information or provisions deemed necessary by the  Department to carry out its granting activities or to accomplish the  purpose of a particular research project grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of grant award. The notice of grant award, in the form of  a letter, will be prepared and will provide pertinent instructions or  information to the grantee that is not included in the grant award  document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Categories of grant instruments. The major categories of grant  instruments shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standard grant. This is a grant instrument by which the  Department agrees to support a specified level of research effort for a  predetermined project period without the announced intention of  providing additional support at a future date. This type of research  project grant is approved on the basis of peer review and recommendation  and is funded for the entire project period at the time of award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renewal grant. This is a document by which the Department agrees  to provide additional funding under a standard grant as specified in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a project period beyond that  approved in an original or amended award, provided that the cumulative  period does not exceed the statutory limitation. When a   renewal application is submitted, it should include a summary of  progress to date under the previous grant instrument. Such a renewal  shall be based upon new application, de novo peer review and staff  evaluation, new recommendation and approval, and a new award instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuation grant. This is a grant instrument by which the  Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a  predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide  additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been  satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and  continued support would be in the best interests of the Federal  Government and the public. It involves a long-term research project that  is considered by peer reviewers and Departmental officers to have an  unusually high degree of scientific merit, the results of which are  expected to have a significant impact on the food and agricultural  sciences, and it supports the efforts of experienced scientists with  records of outstanding research accomplishments. This kind of document  will normally be awarded for an initial one-year period and any  subsequent continuation research project grants will also be awarded in  one-year increments. The award of a continuation research project grant  to fund an initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an  obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. A grantee must submit a  separate application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal  year. Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate  at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget period  currently being funded. Such requests must include: an interim progress  report detailing all work performed to date; a Grant Application; a  proposed budget for the ensuing period, including an estimate of funds  anticipated to remain unobligated at the end of the current budget  period; and current information regarding other extramural support for  senior personnel. Decisions regarding continued support and the actual  funding levels of such support in future years will usually be made  administratively after consideration of such factors as the grantee's  progress and management practices and within the context of available  funds. Since initial peer reviews were based upon the full term and  scope of the original special research grant application, additional  evaluations of this type generally are not required prior to successive  years' support. However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the  project or key personnel change or when the amount of future support  requested substantially exceeds the grant application originally  reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to  approving continued funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supplemental grant. This is an instrument by which the  Department agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a  standard, renewal, or continuation grant as specified in paragraphs  (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section and may involve a short-term  (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that  approved in an original or amended award, but in no case may the  cumulative period of the project, including short term extensions,  exceed the statutory time limitation. A supplement is awarded only if  required to assure adequate completion of the original scope of work and  if there is sufficient justification of need to warrant such action. A  request of this nature normally does not require additional peer review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Obligation of the Federal Government. Neither the approval of  any application nor the award of any research project grant shall commit  or obligate the United States in any way to make any renewal,  supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved  application or portion of an approved application.  [56 FR 58147, Nov 15, 1991, as amended at 79 FR 75997, Dec. 26, 2014]</p>
