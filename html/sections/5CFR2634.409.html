                                Sec. 2634.409  Pre-existing trusts.

                            <p class="depth0">An interested party may place a pre-existing irrevocable trust into  a qualified trust, which may then be certified by the Office of  Government Ethics. This arrangement should be considered in the case of  a pre-existing trust whose terms do not permit amendments that are  necessary to satisfy the rules of this subpart. All of the relevant  parties (including the employee, any other interested parties, the  trustee of the pre-existing trust, and all of the other parties and  beneficiaries of the pre-existing trust) will be required pursuant to  section 102(f)(7) of the Act   to enter into an umbrella trust agreement. The umbrella trust agreement  will specify that the pre-existing trust will be administered in  accordance with the provisions of this subpart. A parent or guardian may  execute the umbrella trust agreement on behalf of a required participant  who is a minor child. The Office of Government Ethics has prepared model  umbrella trust agreements that the employee can use in this  circumstance. The umbrella trust agreement will be certified as a  qualified trust if all of the requirements of this subpart are fulfilled  under conditions where required confidentiality with respect to the  trust can be assured.</p>
