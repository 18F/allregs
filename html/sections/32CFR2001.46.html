                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Classified information shall be transmitted and  received in an authorized manner which ensures that evidence of  tampering can be detected, that inadvertent access can be precluded, and  that provides a method which assures timely delivery to the intended  recipient. Persons transmitting classified information are responsible  for ensuring that intended recipients are authorized persons with the  capability to store classified information in accordance with this  Directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dispatch. Agency heads shall establish procedures which ensure  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All classified information physically transmitted outside  facilities shall be enclosed in two layers, both of which provide  reasonable evidence of tampering and which conceal the contents. The  inner enclosure shall clearly identify the address of both the sender  and the intended recipient, the highest classification level of the  contents, and any appropriate warning notices. The outer enclosure shall  be the same except that no markings to indicate that the contents are  classified shall be visible. Intended recipients shall be identified by  name only as part of an attention line. The following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the classified information is an internal component of a  packable item of equipment, the outside shell or body may be considered  as the inner enclosure provided it does not reveal classified  information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the classified information is an inaccessible internal  component of a bulky item of equipment, the outside or body of the item  may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure provided observation of  it does not reveal classified information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the classified information is an item of equipment that is  not reasonably packable and the shell or body is classified, it shall be  concealed with an opaque enclosure that will hide all classified  features;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specialized shipping containers, including closed cargo  transporters or diplomatic pouch, may be considered the outer enclosure  when used; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When classified information is hand-carried outside a facility,  a locked briefcase may serve as the outer enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Couriers and authorized persons designated to hand-carry  classified information shall ensure that the information remains under  their constant and continuous protection and that direct point-to-point  delivery is made. As an exception, agency heads may approve, as a  substitute for a courier on   direct flights, the use of specialized shipping containers that are of  sufficient construction to provide evidence of forced entry, are secured  with a combination padlock meeting Federal Specification FF-P-110, are  equipped with an electronic seal that would provide evidence of  surreptitious entry and are handled by the carrier in a manner to ensure  that the container is protected until its delivery is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transmission methods within and between the U.S., Puerto Rico,  or a U.S. possession or trust territory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Top Secret. Top Secret information shall be transmitted by  direct contact between authorized persons; the Defense Courier Service  or an authorized government agency courier service; a designated courier  or escort with Top Secret clearance; electronic means over approved  communications systems. Under no circumstances will Top Secret  information be transmitted via the U.S. Postal Service or any other  cleared or uncleared commercial carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secret. Secret information shall be transmitted by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any of the methods established for Top Secret; U.S. Postal  Service Express Mail and U.S. Postal Service Registered Mail, as long as  the Waiver of Signature block on the U.S. Postal Service Express Mail  Label shall not be completed; and cleared commercial carriers or cleared  commercial messenger services. The use of street-side mail collection  boxes is strictly prohibited; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agency heads may, when a requirement exists for overnight  delivery within the U.S. and its Territories, authorize the use of the  current holder of the GSA contract for overnight delivery of information  for the Executive Branch as long as applicable postal regulations (39  CFR. Chapter I) are met. Any such delivery service shall be U.S. owned  and operated, provide automated in-transit tracking of the classified  information, and ensure package integrity during transit. The contract  shall require cooperation with government inquiries in the event of a  loss, theft, or possible unauthorized disclosure of classified  information. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized  person will be available to receive the delivery and verification of the  correct mailing address. The package may be addressed to the recipient  by name. The release signature block on the receipt label shall not be  executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side)  collection boxes is prohibited. Classified Communications Security  Information, NATO, and foreign government information shall not be  transmitted in this manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Confidential. Confidential information shall be transmitted by  any of the methods established for Secret information or U.S. Postal  Service Certified Mail. In addition, when the recipient is a U.S.  Government facility, the Confidential information may be transmitted via  U.S. First Class Mail. However, Confidential information shall not be  transmitted to government contractor facilities via first class mail.  When first class mail is used, the envelope or outer wrapper shall be  marked to indicate that the information is not to be forwarded, but is  to be returned to sender. The use of streetside mail collection boxes is  prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transmission methods to a U.S. Government facility located  outside the U.S. The transmission of classified information to a U.S.  Government facility located outside the 50 states, the District of  Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trust  territory, shall be by methods specified above for Top Secret  information or by the Department of State Courier Service. U.S.  Registered Mail through Military Postal Service facilities may be used  to transmit Secret and Confidential information provided that the  information does not at any time pass out of U.S. citizen control nor  pass through a foreign postal system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transmission of U.S. classified information to foreign  governments. Such transmission shall take place between designated  government representatives using the government-to-government  transmission methods described in paragraph (d) of this section or  through channels agreed to by the National Security Authorities of the  two governments. When classified information is transferred to a foreign  government or   its representative a signed receipt is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Receipt of classified information. Agency heads shall establish  procedures which ensure that classified information is received in a  manner which precludes unauthorized access, provides for inspection of  all classified information received for evidence of tampering and  confirmation of contents, and ensures timely acknowledgment of the  receipt of Top Secret and Secret information by an authorized recipient.
