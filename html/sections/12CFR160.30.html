Amounts in excess of 30% of assets, in the aggregate, may</p><p class="depth0">be invested only in obligations purchased by the association directly</p><p class="depth0">from the original obligor and for which no finder's or referral fees</p><p class="depth0">have been paid. \4\ The 2% of assets limitation is a sublimit for investments within the</p><p class="depth0">overall 5% of assets limitation on community development loans and</p><p class="depth0">investments. The qualitative standards for such loans and investments</p><p class="depth0">are set forth in HOLA section 5(c)(3)(A) (formerly 5(c)(3)(B)), as</p><p class="depth0">explained in an opinion of the Office of Thrift Supervision Chief</p><p class="depth0">Counsel dated May 10, 1995. \5\ Amounts in excess of 30% of assets, in the aggregate, may be</p><p class="depth0">invested only in loans made by the association directly to the</p><p class="depth0">original obligor and for which no finder's or referral fees have been</p><p class="depth0">paid. A Federal savings association may include loans to dealers in</p><p class="depth0">consumer goods to finance inventory and floor planning in the total</p><p class="depth0">investment made under this section. \6\ While there is no statutory limit on certain categories of loans and</p><p class="depth0">investments, including credit card loans, home improvement loans,</p><p class="depth0">education loans, and deposit account loans, the OCC may establish an</p><p class="depth0">individual limit on such loans or investments if the association's</p><p class="depth0">concentration in such loans or investments presents a safety and</p><p class="depth0">soundness concern. \7\ A Federal savings association may engage in leasing activities</p><p class="depth0">subject to the provisions of Sec. 160.41 of this part. \8\ This 1% of assets limitation applies to the aggregate outstanding</p><p class="depth0">investments made under the Foreign Assistance Act and in the capital</p><p class="depth0">of the Inter-American Savings and Loan Bank. Such investments may be</p><p class="depth0">made subject to the provisions of Sec. 160.43 of this part. \9\ A home (or residential) loan includes loans secured by one-to-four</p><p class="depth0">family dwellings, multi-family residential property, and loans secured</p><p class="depth0">by a unit or units of a condominium or housing cooperative. \10\ A Federal savings association may make home loans subject to the</p><p class="depth0">provisions of Secs.  160.33, 160.34, and 160.35 of this part. \11\ Loans secured by savings accounts and other time deposits may be</p><p class="depth0">made without limitation, provided the Federal savings association</p><p class="depth0">obtains a lien on, or a pledge of, such accounts. Such loans may not</p><p class="depth0">exceed the withdrawable amount of the account. \12\ A Federal savings association may only invest in these loans if</p><p class="depth0">they are secured by obligations of, or by obligations fully guaranteed</p><p class="depth0">as to principal and interest by, the United States or any of its</p><p class="depth0">agencies or instrumentalities, the borrower is a financial institution</p><p class="depth0">insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or is a broker or</p><p class="depth0">dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the</p><p class="depth0">market value of the securities for each loan at least equals the</p><p class="depth0">amount of the loan at the time it is made. \13\ If the wheels and axles of the manufactured home have been removed</p><p class="depth0">and it is permanently affixed to a foundation, a loan secured by a</p><p class="depth0">combination of a manufactured home and developed residential lot on</p><p class="depth0">which it sits may be treated as a home loan. \14\ Without regard to any limitations of this part, a Federal savings</p><p class="depth0">association may make or invest in the fully insured or guaranteed</p><p class="depth0">portion of nonresidential real estate loans insured or guaranteed by</p><p class="depth0">the Economic Development Administration, the Farmers Home</p><p class="depth0">Administration, or the Small Business Administration. Unguaranteed</p><p class="depth0">portions of guaranteed loans must be aggregated with uninsured loans</p><p class="depth0">when determining an association's compliance with the 400% of capital</p><p class="depth0">limitation for other real estate loans. \15\ This authority is limited to investments in open-end management</p><p class="depth0">investment companies that are registered with the Securities and</p><p class="depth0">Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The</p><p class="depth0">portfolio of the investment company must be restricted by the</p><p class="depth0">company's investment policy (changeable only if authorized by</p><p class="depth0">shareholder vote) solely to investments that a Federal savings</p><p class="depth0">association may, without limitation as to percentage of assets, invest</p><p class="depth0">in, sell, redeem, hold, or otherwise deal in. Separate and apart from</p><p class="depth0">this authority, a Federal savings association may make pass-through</p><p class="depth0">investments to the extent authorized by Sec. 160.32 of this part. \16\ A Federal savings association may invest in service corporations</p><p class="depth0">subject to the provisions of part 159 of this chapter. \17\ This category includes obligations issued by any state, territory,</p><p class="depth0">or possession of the United States or political subdivision thereof</p><p class="depth0">(including any agency, corporation, or instrumentality of a state or</p><p class="depth0">political subdivision), subject to Sec. 160.42 of this part. \18\ A Federal savings association may invest in state housing</p><p class="depth0">corporations subject to the provisions of Sec. 160.121 of this part. \19\ Payments on accounts in excess of the account balance (overdrafts)</p><p class="depth0">on commercial deposit or transaction accounts shall be considered</p><p class="depth0">commercial loans for purposes of determining the association's</p><p class="depth0">percentage of assets limitation.</p>
