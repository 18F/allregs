                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each reactor licensee shall pay a fee to the Commission based  on the following schedule:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For indemnification from $500 million to $400 million inclusive,  a fee of $30 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity  authorized in the license;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For indemnification from $399 million to $300 million  inclusive, a fee of $24 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal  capacity authorized in the license;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For indemnification from $299 million to $200 million  inclusive, a fee of $18 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal  capacity authorized in the license;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For indemnification from $199 million to $100 million  inclusive, a fee of $12 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal  capacity authorized in the license; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For indemnification from $99 million to $1 million inclusive, a  fee of $6 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized  in the license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No fee will be less than $100 per annum for any nuclear reactor.  This fee is for the period beginning with the date on which the  applicable indemnity agreement is effective. The various levels of  indemnity fees are set forth in the schedule in this paragraph. The  amount of indemnification for determining indemnity fees will be  computed by subtracting from the statutory limit of liability the amount  of financial protection required of the licensee. In the case of  licensees subject to the provision of Sec. 140.11(a)(4), this total  amount will be the amount, as determined by the Commission, of the  financial protection available to licensees at the close of the calendar  year preceding the one in which the fee becomes due. For those instances  in which a certified financial statement is provided as a guarantee of  payment of deferred premiums in accordance with Sec. 140.21(e), a fee  of $1,000 or the indemnity fee, whichever is greater, is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a licensee manufactures a number of nuclear reactors each  having a power level not exceeding 3\1/3\ megawatts, for sale to others  and operates them at the licensee's location temporarily prior to  delivery, the licensee shall report to the Commission the maximum number  of such reactors to be operated at that location at any one time. In  such cases, the fee shall equal $100 multiplied by the number of  reactors reported by the licensee. In the event the number of reactors  operated at any one time exceed the estimate so reported, the licensee  shall report the additional number of reactors to the Commission and  additional charges will be made. If experience shows that less than the  estimated number of reactors have been operated, appropriate adjustment  in subsequent bills will be made by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each person licensed to possess and use plutonium in a plutonium  processing and fuel fabrication plant shall pay to the Commission a fee  of $5,000 per year for indemnification. This fee is for the period  beginning with the date on which the applicable indemnity agreement is  effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Indemnity fee payments, made payable to the U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, are to be made in U.S. funds by check, draft,  money order, credit card, or electronic funds transfer such as ACH  (Automated Clearing House) using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange).  Federal agencies may also make payments by the On-Line Payment and  Collections System (OPAC's). Where specific payment instructions are  provided on the invoices, payment should be made accordingly, e.g.  invoices of $5,000 or more should be paid via ACH through NRC's Lockbox  Bank at the address indicated on the invoice. Credit card payments  should be made up to the limit established by the credit card bank, in  accordance with specific instructions provided with the invoices, to the  Lockbox Bank designated for credit card payments.
