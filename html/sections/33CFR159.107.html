The device must then be rotated 90 degrees on its vertical axis and subjected to another 100 cycles. This testing must be repeated with the liquid retention components filled to the maximum operating level as specified by the manufacturer in Sec. 159.57.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eighty percent of the rolling action must be approximately 15 degrees on either side of the vertical and at a cyclic rate of 3 to 4 seconds.
