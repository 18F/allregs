Assurances from persons or organizations placed on either such list or any organization in which they have a substantial interest shall be considered inadequate for purposes of receiving further grants for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date of notification by the Secretary that they have been placed on the lists unless, by appropriate application to the Secretary, they demonstrate a current responsibility to comply with section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act, and demonstrate that correction of the violations has been made.</p>
