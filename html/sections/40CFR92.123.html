                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The locomotive/locomotive engine test procedure is designed to  determine the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons (HC, total or  non-methane as applicable), total hydrocarbon equivalent (THCE) and  aldehydes (as applicable), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen  (NOX), and particulates, and the opacity of smoke emissions.  The test procedure consists of measurements of brake specific emissions  and smoke opacity at each throttle position and of measurements of smoke  opacity during each change in throttle position as engine power is  increased. If less than 2 percent of the total exhaust flow is removed  for gaseous and particulate sampling in notches 1 through 8, and if less  than 4 percent of the total exhaust flow is removed for gaseous and  particulate sampling at idle and dynamic brake, all measurements of  gaseous, particulate and smoke emissions may be performed during one  test sequence. If more than 2 percent, or 4 percent as applicable, of  the total exhaust is removed for gaseous and particulate sampling,  measurements of gaseous, and particulate emissions are performed during  one test sequence, and a second test sequence is performed for the  measurement of smoke.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the raw exhaust sampling procedure, sample is collected  directly from the exhaust stream during each throttle setting.  Particulates are collected on filters following dilution with ambient  air of another raw exhaust sample. The fuel flow rate for each throttle  setting is measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For locomotives with multiple exhaust stacks, smoke testing is  required for only one of the exhaust stacks provided the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The stack that is not tested is not visibly smokier than the  stack that is tested, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> None of the measured opacity values for the stack tested are  greater than three-quarters of the level allowed by any of the  applicable smoke standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating  conditions (see Secs. 92.124 and 92.126) to be conducted either on a  locomotive; or with the engine mounted on an engine dynamometer, or  attached to a locomotive alternator/generator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Locomotive testing. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The electrical power output produced by  the alternator/generator at each throttle setting is recorded as  measurements of either the wattmeter or the output voltage, phase angle,  and current flow through the electrical resistance bank.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The locomotive fuel supply system shall be disconnected and a  system capable of measuring the net rate at which fuel is supplied to  the engine (accounting for fuel recycle) shall be connected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engine testing. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the test is performed using a  dynamometer, engine torque and rpm shall be recorded during each  throttle setting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The complete engine shall be tested, with all emission control  devices, and charge air cooling equipment installed and functioning.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> On air-cooled engines, the engine cooling fan shall be  installed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Additional accessories (e.g., air compressors) shall be  installed or their loading simulated if typical of the in-use  application. In the case of simulated accessory loadings, the  manufacturer shall make available to the Administrator documentation  which   shows that the simulated loading is representative of in-use operation.  Power for accessories necessary to operate the engine (such as fuel  pumps) shall be treated as parasitic losses and would not be included in  the engine power output for purposes of calculating brake specific  emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The engine may be equipped with a production type starter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Means of engine cooling shall be used which will maintain the  engine operating temperatures (e.g., temperatures of intake air  downstream of charge air coolers, oil, water, etc.) at approximately the  same temperature as would occur in a locomotive at each test point under  the equivalent ambient conditions. In the case of engine intake air  after compression and cooling in the charge air cooler(s), the  temperature of the air entering the engine shall be within [5 F, at  each test point, of the typical temperatures occurring in locomotive  operations under ambient conditions represented by the test. Auxiliary  fan(s) may be used to maintain engine cooling during operation on the  dynamometer. Rust inhibitors and lubrication additives may be used, up  to the levels recommended by the additive manufacturer. If antifreeze is  to be used in the locomotive application, antifreeze mixtures and other  coolants typical of those approved for use in the locomotive may be  used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section apply to  engine testing using a locomotive alternator/generator instead of a  dynamometer.
