                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b). Measure the emissions  of all the pollutants we regulate in Sec.  1048.101 using the sampling  procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065. Measure CO2,  N2O, and CH4 as described in Sec.  1048.235. Use  the applicable duty cycles specified in Sec. Sec.  1048.505 and  1048.510.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 1048.515 describes the supplemental procedures for  evaluating whether engines meet the field-testing emission standards in  Sec.  1048.101(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part 1065,  subpart H, to perform valid tests for all the testing we require in this  part, except as noted in Sec.  1048.515. For service accumulation, use  the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative  of the fuel that in-use engines will use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In place of the provisions of 40 CFR 1065.405, you may consider  emission levels stable without measurement after 50 hours of engine  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To test engines for evaporative emissions, use the equipment and  procedures specified for testing diurnal emissions as described in 40  CFR 1060.525, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Precondition nonmetal fuel tanks as specified in 40 CFR  1060.520(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines equipped with carbon canisters that store fuel  vapors that will be purged for combustion in the engine, precondition  the canister as specified in 40 CFR 86.132-96(h) and then operate the  engine for 60 minutes over repeat runs of the duty cycle specified in  Appendix I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Start the diurnal emission test after the engine is stabilized  at room temperatures, but within 36 hours after the engine operation  specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may not separately measure permeation emissions from  nonmetal fuel tanks for subtracting from the diurnal emission  measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Note that you may omit testing for evaporative emissions during  certification if you certify by design, as specified in Sec.  1048.245.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may use special or alternate procedures to the extent we  allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it  applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we  perform testing to determine if your engines meet emission standards.
