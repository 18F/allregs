Accordingly, such vessels  shall not be considered as being on an ``international voyage'' for the  purpose of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition, although voyages between the continental United  States and Hawaii or Alaska, and voyages between Hawaii and Alaska are  not ``international voyages'' under the provisions of the International  Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, such voyages are similar in  nature and shall be considered as ``international voyages'' for the  purposes of this subchapter.
