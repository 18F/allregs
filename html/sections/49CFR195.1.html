                                Sec. 195.1  Which pipelines are covered by this Part?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Covered. Except for the pipelines listed in paragraph (b) of this Section, this Part applies to pipeline facilities and the transportation of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide associated with those facilities in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, including pipeline facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Covered pipelines include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any pipeline that transports a highly volatile liquid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any pipeline segment that crosses a waterway currently used for commercial navigation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except for a gathering line not covered by paragraph (a)(4) of this Section, any pipeline located in a rural or non-rural area of any diameter regardless of operating pressure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any of the following onshore gathering lines used for transportation of petroleum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pipeline located in a non-rural area;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A regulated rural gathering line as provided in Sec. 195.11; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A pipeline located in an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico as provided in Sec. 195.413.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excepted. This Part does not apply to any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transportation of a hazardous liquid transported in a gaseous state;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transportation of a hazardous liquid through a pipeline by gravity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transportation of a hazardous liquid through any of the following low-stress pipelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pipeline subject to safety regulations of the U.S. Coast Guard; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A pipeline that serves refining, manufacturing, or truck, rail, or vessel terminal facilities, if the pipeline is less than one mile long (measured outside facility grounds) and does not cross an offshore area or a waterway currently used for commercial navigation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transportation of petroleum through an onshore rural gathering line that does not meet the definition of a ``regulated rural gathering line'' as provided in Sec. 195.11. This exception does not apply to gathering lines in the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico subject to Sec. 195.413;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in an offshore pipeline in state waters where the pipeline is located upstream from the outlet flange of the following farthest downstream facility: The facility where hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are produced or the facility where produced hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are first separated, dehydrated, or otherwise processed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in a pipeline on the OCS where the pipeline is located upstream of the point at which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A pipeline segment upstream (generally seaward) of the last valve on the last production facility on the OCS where a pipeline on the OCS is producer-operated and crosses into state waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the OCS. Safety equipment protecting PHMSA-regulated pipeline segments is not excluded. A producing operator of a segment falling within this exception may petition the Administrator, under Sec. 190.9 of this chapter, for approval to operate under PHMSA regulations governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through onshore production (including flow lines), refining, or manufacturing facilities or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other non-pipeline mode of transportation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Through facilities located on the grounds of a materials transportation terminal if the facilities are used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between non-pipeline modes of transportation or between a non-pipeline mode and a pipeline. These facilities do not include any device and associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline under Sec. 195.406(b); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Transportation of carbon dioxide downstream from the applicable following point:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inlet of a compressor used in the injection of carbon dioxide for oil recovery operations, or the point where recycled carbon dioxide enters the injection system, whichever is farther upstream; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The connection of the first branch pipeline in the production field where the pipeline transports carbon dioxide to an injection well or to a header or manifold from which a pipeline branches to an injection well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Breakout tanks. Breakout tanks subject to this Part must comply with requirements that apply specifically to breakout tanks and, to the extent applicable, with requirements that apply to pipeline systems and pipeline facilities. If a conflict exists between a requirement that applies specifically to breakout tanks and a requirement that applies to pipeline systems or pipeline facilities, the requirement that applies specifically to breakout tanks prevails. Anhydrous ammonia breakout tanks need not comply with Secs. 195.132(b), 195.205(b), 195.242(c) and (d), 195.264(b) and (e), 195.307, 195.428(c) and (d), and 195.432(b) and (c).</p><p class="depth2">Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec. 195.1, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.</p>
