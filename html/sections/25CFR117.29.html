The proceeds of all such sales shall be deposited to the credit of the Indian as surplus funds. Improvements consisting of buildings, etc., located on property within the Osage villages of Pawhuska, Hominy, and Grayhorse may, upon approval of the superintendent, be disposed of to other Osage Indians. The superintendent may disburse the surplus funds of the purchaser to consummate the transaction. Sale of such improvements to non-Indian or non-Osage Indians must be approved by the Commissioner.</p>
