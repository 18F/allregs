                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A federally-insured state credit union may convert to nonfederal  insurance, if permitted by state law, either on its own or by merging  into a nonfederally-insured credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A federal credit union may convert to nonfederal insurance only  by merging into, or converting its charter to, a nonfederally-insured  state credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conversion to nonfederal insurance requires the prior written  approval of the NCUA. After the credit union board of directors resolves  to seek a conversion, the credit union must notify the Regional Director  promptly, in writing, of the desired conversion and request NCUA  approval of the conversion. The notification must be in the form  specified in subpart C of this part, unless the Regional Director  approves a different form. The credit union must provide this  notification and request for approval to the Regional Director at least  14 days before the credit union notifies its members and seeks their  vote and at least 90 days before the proposed conversion date. NCUA will  approve or disapprove the conversion as described in paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval of a conversion of Federal to nonfederal insurance  requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the credit union's  members who vote on the proposition, provided at least 20 percent of the  total membership participates in the voting. The vote must be taken by  secret ballot and conducted by an independent entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For all conversions, the notice to the NCUA must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written statement from the credit union that ``it is aware of  the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1831t(b), including all notification and  acknowledgment requirements;'' and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proof that the nonfederal insurer is authorized to issue share  insurance in the state where the credit union is located and that the  insurer will insure the credit union.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The board of directors of the credit union and the independent  entity that conducts the membership vote must certify the results of the  membership vote to the NCUA within 14 calendar days after the deadline  for receipt of votes. The certification must include the total number of  members of record of the credit union, the number who voted on the  conversion, the number who voted in favor of the conversion, and the  number who voted against. The certification must be in the form  specified in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Generally, the NCUA will conditionally approve or disapprove the  conversion in writing within 14 days after receiving the certification  of the vote. The credit union must complete the conversion within six  months of the date of conditional approval. If a credit union fails to  complete the conversion within six months the Regional Director will  disapprove the conversion. The credit union's board of directors, if it  still wishes to convert, must then adopt a new conversion proposal and  solicit another member vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For conversions by merger, the merging credit unions must follow  the procedures specified in subparts A and B of this part and use the  forms specified in subpart C of this part. In the event the procedures  of Subpart A and B conflict, the credit union must follow subpart B.
