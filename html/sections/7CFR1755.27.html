(1) If a borrower is required by part 1753 to use a listed contract form, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS. The forms shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing. Any modifications approved by RUS must be clearly shown so as to indicate the difference from the listed contract form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a borrower is required by part 1753 to use a listed contract form, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS.
