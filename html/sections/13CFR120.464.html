                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An SBA Supervised Lender must submit the following to SBA:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual Report. Within three months after the close of each fiscal year, each SBA Supervised Lender must submit to SBA two copies of an annual report including audited financial statements as prepared by a certified public accountant in accordance with Sec. 120.463. Specifically, the annual report must, at a minimum, include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Audited balance sheet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Audited statement of income and expense;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Audited reconciliation of capital accounts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Audited source and application of funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Such footnotes as are necessary to an understanding of the report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Auditor's letter to management on internal control weaknesses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The auditor's report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly Condition Reports. By the 45th calendar day following the end of each calendar quarter, each SBA Supervised Lender must submit a Quarterly Condition Report in a form and content as the SBA may prescribe from time to time. At a minimum, the Quarterly Condition Report must include the SBA Supervised Lender's quarterly financial statements, which may be internally prepared. The SBA Supervised Lender must apply uniform definitions to categories of nonperforming loans and include recovery amounts on liquidated loans. SBA may, on a case-by-case basis, depending on an SBA Supervised Lender's size and the quality of its assets, adjust the requirements for content and frequency of filing Quarterly Condition Reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Legal and Administrative Proceeding Report. Each SBA Supervised Lender must report any legal or administrative proceeding by or against the SBA Supervised Lender, or against any officer, director or employee of the SBA Supervised Lender for an alleged breach of official duty, within ten business days after initiating or learning of the proceeding, and also must notify the SBA of the terms of any settlement or final judgment. The SBA Supervised Lender must include such information in any reporting required under other provisions of SBA regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stockholder Reports. Each SBA Supervised Lender must submit to SBA a copy of any report furnished to its stockholders in any manner, within 30 calendar days after submission to stockholders, including any prospectus, letter, or other document, concerning the financial operations or condition of the SBA Supervised Lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reports of Changes. Each SBA Supervised Lender must submit to SBA a summary of any changes in the SBA Supervised Lender's organization or financing (within 30 calendar days of the change), such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any change in its name, address or telephone number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any change in its charter, bylaws, or its officers or directors (to be

accompanied by a statement of personal history on the form approved by SBA);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any change in capitalization, including such types of change as are identified in this part 120;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any changes affecting an SBA Supervised Lender's eligibility to continue to participate as an SBA Supervised Lender; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Notice of any pledge of stock (within 30 calendar days of the transaction) if 10 percent or more of the stock is pledged by any person (or group of persons acting in concert) as collateral for indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Report of Changes in Financial Condition. In addition to other reports required under this part 120, each SBA Supervised Lender must submit a report to SBA on any material change in financial condition. The SBA Supervised Lender must submit such report promptly, but no later than ten days after its management becomes aware of such change (except as provided for in Sec. 120.462(d)). Failure to promptly notify SBA concerning a material change in financial condition may lead to enforcement action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other Reports. Each SBA Supervised Lender must submit such other reports as SBA from time to time may in writing require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparing financial reports for filing. Each SBA Supervised Lender must prepare financial reports:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, procedures, standards, and such instructions and specifications and in such form and media format as may be prescribed by SBA from time to time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On an accrual basis, in accordance with GAAP principles and such other accounting requirements, standards, and procedures as may be prescribed by the SBA from time to time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That contain all applicable footnotes in accordance with GAAP principals, one of which includes a brief analysis of how the SBA Supervised Lender complies with SBA's capital regulations, as applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In such manner as to facilitate the reconciliation of these reports with the books and records of the SBA Supervised Lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility for assuring the accuracy of filed financial reports. Each financial report filed with SBA must be certified as having been prepared in accordance with all applicable regulations, SOPs, notices, and instructions and to be a true, accurate, and complete representation of the financial condition and financial performance of the SBA Supervised Lender to which it applies. The reports must be certified by the officer of the reporting SBA Supervised Lender named for that purpose by action of the institution's board of directors. If the institution's board of directors has not acted to name an officer to certify the correctness of its reports of financial condition and financial performance, then the reports must be certified by the president or chief executive officer of the reporting SBA Supervised Lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver. The appropriate Office of Capital Access official in accordance with Delegations of Authority may in his/her discretion waive any Sec. 120.464 reporting requirement for SBA Supervised Lenders for good cause (including, but not limited to, where an SBA Supervised Lender has a relatively small SBA loan portfolio), as determined by SBA. SBA Supervised Lenders must request the waiver in writing and include all supporting reasons and documentation. The waiver decision of the appropriate Office of Capital Access official in accordance with Delegations of Authority is final.
