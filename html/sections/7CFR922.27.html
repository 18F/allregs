In the event of the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification of a member, his alternate shall act for him until a successor for such member is selected and has qualified. In the event both a member of the committee and his alternate are unable to attend a committee meeting, the member or the committee may designate any other alternate member from the same district and group (handler or grower) to serve in such member's place and stead.</p>
