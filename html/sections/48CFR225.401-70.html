                            <p class="depth0">Acquisitions of end products in the following product service groups  (PSGs) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition  is at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception  applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade  agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end  products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible  for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain  watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries  are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of  Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any  product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub.  L. 103-139.</p><p class="depth0">PSG                          Category/Description</p><p class="depth0">22                               Railway equipment 23                               Motor vehicles, trailers, and cycles</p><p class="depth0">(except 2305, 2350, and buses under</p><p class="depth0">2310) 24                               Tractors 25                               Vehicular equipment components 26                               Tires and tubes 29                               Engine accessories 30                               Mechanical power transmission equipment 32                               Woodworking machinery and equipment 34                               Metalworking machinery 35                               Service and trade equipment 36                               Special industry machinery (except</p><p class="depth0">3690) 37                               Agricultural machinery and equipment 38                               Construction, mining, excavating, and</p><p class="depth0">highway maintenance equipment 39                               Materials handling equipment 40                               Rope, cable, chain, and fittings 41                               Refrigeration, air conditioning, and</p><p class="depth0">air circulating equipment 42                               Fire fighting, rescue, and safety</p><p class="depth0">equipment;
