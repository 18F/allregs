                            <p class="depth0">Acquisitions of end products in the following product service groups (PSGs) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition is at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.</p><p class="depth0">PSG                          Category/Description</p><p class="depth0">22                               Railway equipment23                               Motor vehicles, trailers, and cycles</p><p class="depth0">(except 2305, 2350, and buses under</p><p class="depth0">2310)24                               Tractors25                               Vehicular equipment components26                               Tires and tubes29                               Engine accessories30                               Mechanical power transmission equipment32                               Woodworking machinery and equipment34                               Metalworking machinery35                               Service and trade equipment36                               Special industry machinery (except</p><p class="depth0">3690)37                               Agricultural machinery and equipment38                               Construction, mining, excavating, and</p><p class="depth0">highway maintenance equipment39                               Materials handling equipment40                               Rope, cable, chain, and fittings41                               Refrigeration, air conditioning, and</p><p class="depth0">air circulating equipment42                               Fire fighting, rescue, and safety</p><p class="depth0">equipment;
