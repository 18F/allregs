                                Sec. 1.338-10  Filing of returns.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Returns including tax liability from deemed asset sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this  section, any deemed sale tax consequences are reported on the final  return of old target filed for old target's taxable year that ends at  the close of the acquisition date. Paragraphs (a)(2), (3) and (4) of  this section do not apply to elections under section 338(h)(10). If old  target is the common parent of an affiliated group, the final return may  be a consolidated return (any such consolidated return must also include  any deemed sale tax consequences of any members of the consolidated  group that are acquired by the purchasing corporation on the same  acquisition date as old target).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Old target's final taxable year otherwise included in  consolidated return of selling group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If the selling  group files a consolidated return for the period that includes the  acquisition date, old target is disaffiliated from that group  immediately before the deemed asset sale and must file a deemed sale  return separate from the group, which includes only the deemed sale tax  consequences and the carryover items specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)  of this section. The deemed asset sale occurs at the close of the  acquisition date and is the last transaction of old target and the only  transaction reported on the separate return. Except as provided in Sec.  1.338-1(d) (regarding certain transactions on the acquisition date), any  transactions of old target occurring on the acquisition date other than  the deemed asset sale are included in the selling group's consolidated  return. A deemed sale return includes a combined deemed sale return as  defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate taxable year. The deemed asset sale included in the  deemed sale   return under this paragraph (a)(2) occurs in a separate taxable year,  except that old target's taxable year of the sale and the consolidated  year of the selling group that includes the acquisition date are treated  as the same year for purposes of determining the number of years in a  carryover or carryback period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Carryover and carryback of tax attributes. Target's attributes  may be carried over to, and carried back from, the deemed sale return  under the rules applicable to a corporation that ceases to be a member  of a consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Old target is a component member of purchasing corporation's  controlled group. For purposes of its deemed sale return, target is a  component member of the controlled group of corporations including the  purchasing corporation unless target is treated as an excluded member  under section 1563(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combined deemed sale return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Under section  338(h)(15), a combined deemed sale return (combined return) may be filed  for all targets from a single selling consolidated group (as defined in  Sec. 1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(3)) that are acquired by the purchasing  corporation on the same acquisition date and that otherwise would be  required to file separate deemed sale returns. The combined return must  include all such targets. For example, T and T1 may be included in a  combined return if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> T and T1 are directly owned subsidiaries of S;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> S is the common parent of a consolidated group; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> P makes qualified stock purchases of T and T1 on the same  acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gain and loss offsets. Gains and losses recognized on the  deemed asset sales by targets included in a combined return are treated  as the gains and losses of a single target. In addition, loss carryovers  of a target that were not subject to the separate return limitation year  restrictions (SRLY restrictions) of the consolidated return regulations  while that target was a member of the selling consolidated group may be  applied without limitation to the gains of other targets included in the  combined return. If, however, a target has loss carryovers that were  subject to the SRLY restrictions while that target was a member of the  selling consolidated group, the use of those losses in the combined  return continues to be subject to those restrictions, applied in the  same manner as if the combined return were a consolidated return. A  similar rule applies, when appropriate, to other tax attributes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedure for filing a combined return. A combined return is  made by filing a single corporation income tax return in lieu of  separate deemed sale returns for all targets required to be included in  the combined return. The combined return reflects the deemed asset sales  of all targets required to be included in the combined return. If the  targets included in the combined return constitute a single affiliated  group within the meaning of section 1504(a), the income tax return is  signed by an officer of the common parent of that group. Otherwise, the  return must be signed by an officer of each target included in the  combined return. Rules similar to the rules in Sec. 1.1502-75(j) apply  for purposes of preparing the combined return. The combined return must  include a statement entitled, ``ELECTION TO FILE A COMBINED RETURN UNDER  SECTION 338(h)(15).'' The statement must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name, address, and employer identification number of each  target required to be included in the combined return; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The following declaration: EACH TARGET IDENTIFIED IN THIS  ELECTION TO FILE A COMBINED RETURN CONSENTS TO THE FILING OF A COMBINED  RETURN.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consequences of filing a combined return. Each target included  in a combined return is severally liable for any tax associated with the  combined return. See Sec. 1.338-1(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deemed sale excluded from purchasing corporation's consolidated  return. Old target may not be considered a member of any affiliated  group that includes the purchasing corporation with respect to its  deemed asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Due date for old target's final return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Old  target's final return is generally due on the 15th day of the third  calendar month following the month in which the acquisition   date occurs. See section 6072 (time for filing income tax returns).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of Sec. 1.1502-76(c)--(A) In general. Section  1.1502-76(c) applies to old target's final return if old target was a  member of a selling group that did not file consolidated returns for the  taxable year of the common parent that precedes the year that includes  old target's acquisition date. If the selling group has not filed a  consolidated return that includes old target's taxable period that ends  on the acquisition date, target may, on or before the final return due  date (including extensions), either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> File a deemed sale return on the assumption that the selling  group will file the consolidated return; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> File a return for so much of old target's taxable period as ends  at the close of the acquisition date on the assumption that the  consolidated return will not be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deemed extension. For purposes of applying Sec. 1.1502- 76(c)(2), an extension of time to file old target's final return is  considered to be in effect until the last date for making the election  under section 338.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Erroneous filing of deemed sale return. If, under this paragraph  (a)(6)(ii), target files a deemed sale return but the selling group does  not file a consolidated return, target must file a substituted return  for old target not later than the due date (including extensions) for  the return of the common parent with which old target would have been  included in the consolidated return. The substituted return is for so  much of old target's taxable year as ends at the close of the  acquisition date. Under Sec. 1.1502-76(c)(2), the deemed sale return is  not considered a return for purposes of section 6011 (relating to the  general requirement of filing a return) if a substituted return must be  filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Erroneous filing of return for regular tax year. If, under this  paragraph (a)(6)(ii), target files a return for so much of old target's  regular taxable year as ends at the close of the acquisition date but  the selling group files a consolidated return, target must file an  amended return for old target not later than the due date (including  extensions) for the selling group's consolidated return. (The amended  return is a deemed sale return.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Last date for payment of tax. If either a substituted or amended  final return of old target is filed under this paragraph (a)(6)(ii), the  last date prescribed for payment of tax is the final return due date (as  defined in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S is the common parent of a consolidated group that  includes T. The S group files calendar year consolidated returns. At the  close of June 30 of Year 1, P makes a qualified stock purchase of T from  S. P makes a section 338 election for T, and T's deemed asset sale  occurs as of the close of T's acquisition date (June 30).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> T is considered disaffiliated for purposes of reporting the  deemed sale tax consequences. Accordingly, T is included in the S  group's consolidated return through T's acquisition date except that the  tax liability for the deemed sale tax consequences is reported in a  separate deemed sale return of T. Provided that T is not treated as an  excluded member under section 1563(b)(2), T is a component member of P's  controlled group for the taxable year of the deemed asset sale, and the  taxable income bracket amounts available in calculating tax on the  deemed sale return must be limited accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If P purchased the stock of T at 10 a.m. on June 30 of Year 1,  the results would be the same. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the S  group does not file consolidated returns. T must file a separate return  for its taxable year ending on June 30 of Year 1, which return includes  the deemed asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Waiver--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain additions to tax. An addition to tax or  additional amount (addition) under subchapter A of chapter 68 of the  Internal Revenue Code arising on or before the last day for making the  election under section 338 because of circumstances that would not exist  but for an election under section 338 is waived if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the particular statute the addition is excusable upon a  showing of reasonable cause; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corrective action is taken on or before the last day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notification. The Internal Revenue Service should be notified at  the time of correction (e.g., by attaching a statement to a return that  constitutes   corrective action) that the waiver rule of this paragraph (b) is being  asserted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elections or other actions required to be specified on a timely  filed return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If paragraph (b)(1) of this section  applies or would apply if there were an underpayment, any election or  other action that must be specified on a timely filed return for the  taxable period covered by the late filed return described in paragraph  (b)(1) of this section is considered timely if specified on a late-filed  return filed on or before the last day for making the election under  section 338.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New target in purchasing corporation's consolidated return. If  new target is includible for its first taxable year in a consolidated  return filed by the affiliated group of which the purchasing corporation  is a member on or before the last day for making the election under  section 338, any election or other action that must be specified in a  timely filed return for new target's first taxable year (but which is  not specified in the consolidated return) is considered timely if  specified in an amended return filed on or before such last day, at the  place where the consolidated return was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. T is an unaffiliated corporation with a tax year ending  March 31. At the close of September 20 of Year 1, P makes a qualified  stock purchase of T. P does not join in filing a consolidated return. P  makes a section 338 election for T on or before June 15 of Year 2, which  causes T's taxable year to end as of the close of September 20 of Year  1. An income tax return for T's taxable period ending on September 20 of  Year 1 was due on December 15 of Year 1. Additions to tax for failure to  file a return and to pay tax shown on a return will not be imposed if  T's return is filed and the tax paid on or before June 15 of Year 2.  (This waiver applies even if the acquisition date coincides with the  last day of T's former taxable year, i.e., March 31 of Year 2.) Interest  on any underpayment of tax for old T's short taxable year ending  September 20 of Year 1 runs from December 15 of Year 1. A statement  indicating that the waiver rule of this paragraph is being asserted  should be attached to T's return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further  that new T adopts the calendar year by filing, on or before June 15 of  Year 2, its first return (for the period beginning on September 21 of  Year 1 and ending on December 31 of Year 1) indicating that a calendar  year is chosen. See Sec. 1.338-1(b)(1). Any additions to tax or amounts  described in this paragraph (b) that arise because of the late filing of  a return for the period ending on December 31 of Year 1 are waived,  because they are based on circumstances that would not exist but for the  section 338 election. Notwithstanding this waiver, however, the return  is still considered due March 15 of Year 2, and interest on any  underpayment runs from that date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that T's  former taxable year ends on October 31. Although prior to the election  old T had a return due on January 15 of Year 2 for its year ending  October 31 of Year 1, that return need not be filed because a timely  election under section 338 was made. Instead, old T must file a final  return for the period ending on September 20 of Year 1, which is due on  December 15 of Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this  section applies to any taxable year beginning on or after May 30, 2006.  However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section to  any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return  filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original  return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years  beginning before May 30, 2006, see Sec. 1.338-10 as contained in 26 CFR  part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
