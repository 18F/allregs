                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior notice requirement. Any person acting directly or  indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, shall  give the FDIC 60 days prior written notice, as specified in Sec. 303.84,  before acquiring control of an insured state nonmember bank or any  parent company, unless the acquisition is exempt under Sec. 303.83.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition requiring prior notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquisition of control.  The acquisition of control, unless exempted, requires prior notice to  the FDIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttable presumption of control. The FDIC presumes that an  acquisition of voting shares of an insured state nonmember bank or a  parent company constitutes the acquisition of the power to direct the  management or policies of an insured bank or a parent company requiring  prior notice to the FDIC, if, immediately after the transaction, the  acquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own, control, or  hold with power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of voting shares  of the institution, and if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The institution has registered shares under section 12 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No other person will own, control or hold the power to vote a  greater percentage of that class of voting shares immediately after the  transaction. If two or more persons, not acting in concert, each propose  to acquire simultaneously equal percentages of 10 percent or more of a  class of voting shares of an insured state nonmember bank or a parent  company, each such person shall file prior notice with the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of loans in default. The FDIC presumes an  acquisition of a loan in default that is secured by voting shares of an  insured state nonmember bank or a parent company to be an acquisition of  the underlying shares for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other transactions. Acquisitions other than those set forth in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section resulting in a person's control of less  than 25 percent of a class of voting shares of an insured state  nonmember bank or a parent company are not deemed by the FDIC to  constitute control for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rebuttal of presumptions. Prior notice to the FDIC is not  required for any acquisition of voting shares under the presumption of  control set forth in this section, if the FDIC finds that the  acquisition will not result in control. The FDIC will afford any person  seeking to rebut a presumption in this section an opportunity to present  views in writing or, if appropriate, orally before its designated  representatives at an informal meeting.
