                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Prior notice requirement. (1) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 303.83 and 303.84, no person, acting directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, shall acquire control of a covered institution unless the person shall have given the FDIC prior notice of the proposed acquisition as provided in the CBCA and this subpart, and the FDIC has not disapproved the acquisition within 60 days or such longer period as may be permitted under the CBCA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 303.83 and 303.84, and unless waived by the FDIC, no person who has been approved to acquire control of a covered institution and who has maintained that control shall acquire, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more

persons, voting securities of such covered institution if that person's ownership, control, or power to vote will increase from less than 25 percent to 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the covered institution, unless the person shall have given the FDIC prior notice of the proposed acquisition as provided in the CBCA and this subpart, and the FDIC has not disapproved the acquisition within 60 days or such longer period as may be permitted under the CBCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rebuttable presumptions--(1) Rebuttable presumptions of control. The FDIC presumes that an acquisition of voting securities of a covered institution constitutes the acquisition of the power to direct the management or policies of that institution requiring prior notice to the FDIC, if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person will own, control, or hold with power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution, and if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The institution has registered securities under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No other person will own, control or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttable presumptions of acting in concert. The following persons who own or control, or propose to own or control voting securities in a covered institution, shall be presumed to be acting in concert for purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A company and any controlling shareholder or management official of the company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual and one or more members of the individual's immediate family;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Companies under common control or a company and each company it controls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Two or more persons that have made, or propose to make, a joint filing related to the proposed acquisition under sections 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78n), and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A person and any trust for which the person serves as trustee or any trust for which the person is a beneficiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Persons that are parties to any agreement, contract, understanding, relationship, or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise, regarding the acquisition, voting, or transfer of control of voting securities of a covered institution, other than through revocable proxies as described in Sec. 303.84(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Convertible securities, options, and warrants. The acquisition of convertible securities, or options or warrants to acquire voting securities is presumed to constitute the acquisition of voting securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rebuttal of presumptions. The FDIC will afford any person seeking to rebut a presumption in this paragraph (b) an opportunity to present its views in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of loans in default. An acquisition of a loan in default that is secured by voting securities of a covered institution is deemed to be an acquisition of the underlying securities for purposes of this subpart. Before acquiring a loan in default that upon foreclosure would result in the acquiring person owning, controlling, or holding with the power to vote a controlling amount of a covered institution's voting securities, the potential acquirer must give the FDIC prior written notice as specified in this subpart.</p>
