                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act authorizes three forms of benefits to requesters deemed eligible by the Secretary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment or reimbursement for reasonable and necessary medical services and items to diagnose or treat a covered injury or its health complications, as described in Sec.  102.31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lost employment income incurred as a result of a covered injury, as described in Sec.  102.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Death payments to survivors if the Secretary determines that the death of the smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact was the direct result of a covered injury, as described in Sec.  102.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The benefits paid under the Program, with the exception of death benefits paid under Sec.  102.82(c), are secondary to any obligation of any third-party payor to pay for such benefits.

Death benefits paid under Sec.  102.82(c) are secondary to death and disability benefits under the PSOB Program. The benefits paid under the Program usually will only be paid after the requester has pursued all other available coverage from all third-party payors with an obligation to pay for or provide such benefits (e.g., medical insurance for medical items, workers' compensation program(s) for lost employment income). However, as provided in Sec.  102.84, the Secretary has the discretion to pay benefits under this Program before a potential third-party payor makes a determination on the availability of similar benefits and has the right to later pursue a claim against any third-party payor with a legal or contractual obligation to pay for, or provide, such benefits.</p>
