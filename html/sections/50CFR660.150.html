                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The MS Coop Program is a general term to describe the limited access program that applies to eligible harvesters and processors in the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting at-sea trawl fishery. Eligible harvesters and processors, including coop and non-coop fishery participants, must meet the requirements set forth in this section of the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations. Each year a vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit may fish in either the coop or non-coop portion of the MS Coop Program, but not both. In addition to the requirements of this section, the MS Coop Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations of subparts C and D of this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pacific whiting seasons Sec. 660.131(b), subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Area restrictions specified for midwater trawl gear used to harvest Pacific whiting fishery specified at Sec. 660.131(c), Subpart D for GCAs, RCAs, Salmon Conservation Zones, BRAs, and EFHCAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C: Sec. 660.11 Definitions, Sec. 660.12 Prohibitions, Sec. 660.13 Recordkeeping and reporting, Sec. 660.14 VMS requirements, Sec. 660.15 Equipment requirements, Sec. 660.16 Groundfish Observer Program, Sec. 660.20 Vessel and gear identification, Sec. 660.25 Permits, Sec. 660.55 Allocations, Sec. 660.60 Specifications and management measures, Sec. 660.65 Groundfish harvest specifications, and Sec.

owners, and owners and operators of vessels registered to member limited entry permits, are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each MS coop, member permit owner, and owner and operator of a vessel registered to a coop member permit may be charged jointly and severally for violations of the provisions of this section. For purposes of enforcement, an MS coop is a legal entity that can be subject to NOAA enforcement action for violations of the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> MS Coop Program species and allocations--(1) MS Coop Program species. MS Coop Program species are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> MS Coop Program species. MS Coop Program species are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species with formal allocations to the MS Coop Program are Pacific whiting, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, Pacific Ocean perch, and widow rockfish;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Species with set-asides for the MS and C/P Coop Programs combined, as described in Tables 1d and 2d, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual mothership sector sub-allocations. Annual allocation amount(s) will be determined using the following procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> MS/CV catch history assignments. Catch history assignments will be based on catch history using the following methodology:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pacific whiting catch history assignment. Each MS/CV endorsement's associated catch history assignment of Pacific whiting will be annually allocated to a single permitted MS coop or to the non-coop fishery. If multiple MS/CV endorsements and their associated CHAs are registered to a limited entry permit, that permit may be simultaneously registered to more than one MS coop or to both a coop(s) and non-coop fishery. Once assigned to a permitted MS coop or to the non-coop fishery, each MS/CV endorsement's catch history assignment remains with that permitted MS coop or non-coop fishery for that calendar year. When the mothership sector allocation is established, the information for the conversion of catch history assignment to pounds will be made available to the public through a Federal Register announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS Web site. The amount of whiting from the catch history assignment will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules (i.e., less than 0.5 rounds down and 0.5 and greater rounds up).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), allocation for Pacific whiting will be made by the start of the season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), NMFS will issue Pacific whiting allocations in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate Pacific whiting based on the MS Coop Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of Pacific whiting to the MS Coop Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-whiting groundfish species catch--(1) Non-whiting groundfish species with a mothership sector allocation will be divided annually between the permitted coops and the non-coop fishery. The pounds associated with each permitted MS coop will be provided when the coop permit is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), allocation of non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation will be made by the start of the season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In years where the groundfish harvest specifications are not known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at Sec. 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), NMFS will issue allocations for non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation in two parts. Before the start of the whiting primary season, NMFS will allocate non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation based on the MS Coop Program allocation percent multiplied by the

lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for those species for that year. After the final groundfish harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of non-whiting groundfish species with an allocation to the MS Coop Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Groundfish species with at-sea sector set-asides will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on another fisheries, or conservation concerns in which case inseason action may be taken. Set asides may be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process as necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Groundfish species not addressed in paragraph (1) or (2) above, will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on another fisheries, or conservation concerns in which case inseason action may be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Halibut set-asides. Annually a specified amount of the Pacific halibut will be held in reserve as a shared set-aside for bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fisheries and the shorebased trawl sector south of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rounding rules may affect distribution of the MS Coop Program allocations among the catch history assignments for individual MS/CV-endorsed permits. NMFS will distribute such allocations to the maximum extent practicable, not to exceed the total allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annual coop allocations--(A) Pacific whiting. Each permitted MS coop is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is based on the sum of the catch history assignments for each member MS/CV-endorsed permit identified in the NMFS-accepted coop agreement for a given calendar year. Other limited entry permits registered to vessels that will fish for the coop do not bring catch allocation to a permitted MS coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pacific whiting. Each permitted MS coop is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is based on the sum of the catch history assignments for each member MS/CV-endorsed permit identified in the NMFS-accepted coop agreement for a given calendar year. Other limited entry permits registered to vessels that will fish for the coop do not bring catch allocation to a permitted MS coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-whiting groundfish with allocations. Sub-allocations of non-whiting groundfish species with allocations to permitted MS coops will be in proportion to the Pacific whiting catch history assignments assigned to each permitted MS coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If all MS/CV-endorsed permits are members of a single coop in a given year and there is not a non-coop fishery, then NMFS will allocate 100 percent of the MS Coop Program allocation to that coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Annual non-coop allocation--(A) Pacific whiting. The non-coop whiting fishery is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is remaining in the mothership sector annual allocation after the deduction of all coop allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pacific whiting. The non-coop whiting fishery is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is remaining in the mothership sector annual allocation after the deduction of all coop allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-whiting groundfish with allocations. The sub-allocation to the non-coop fishery will be in proportion to the mothership catcher vessel Pacific whiting catch history assignments for the non-coop fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Announcement of the non-coop fishery allocations. Information on the amount of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish with allocations that will be made available to the non-coop fishery when the final Pacific whiting specifications for the mothership sector is established and will be announced to the public through a Federal Register announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reaching an allocation or sub-allocation. When the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation, Pacific whiting sub-allocation, or non-whiting groundfish catch allocation is reached or is projected to be reached, the following action may be taken:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Further harvesting, receiving or at-sea processing by a mothership or catcher vessel in the mothership sector is prohibited when the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation or non-whiting groundfish allocation is projected to be reached. No additional unprocessed groundfish may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a mothership may continue to process catch that was on board before at-sea processing was prohibited. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a catcher vessel participating in the mothership sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When a permitted MS coop sub-allocation of Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish species is reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in the

permitted MS coop must cease, unless the permitted MS coop is operating under an NMFS-accepted inter-coop agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the non-coop fishery sub-allocation of Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish species is projected to be reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in under the non-coop fishery must cease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-whiting groundfish species reapportionment. This paragraph (c)(4) describes the process for reapportioning non-whiting groundfish species with allocations between permitted MS coops and the catcher/processor sector. Reapportionment of mothership sector allocations to the catcher/processor will not occur until all permitted MS coops and the non-coop fishery have been closed by NMFS or have informed NMFS that they have ceased operations for the remainder of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within the mothership sector. The Regional Administrator may make available for harvest to permitted coops and the non-coop fishery that have not notified NMFS that they have ceased fishing for the year, the amounts of a permitted MS coop's non-whiting catch allocation remaining when a coop reaches its Pacific whiting allocation or when the designated coop manager notifies NMFS that a permitted coop has ceased fishing for the year. The reapportioned allocations will be in proportion to their original allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Between the mothership and catcher/processor sectors. The Regional Administrator may make available for harvest to the catcher/processor sector of the Pacific whiting fishery, the amounts of the mothership sector's non-whiting catch allocation remaining when the Pacific whiting allocation is reached or participants in the sector do not intend to harvest the remaining allocation. If participants in the sector do not intend to harvest the sector's remaining allocation, the designated coop manager, or in the case of an inter-coop, all of the designated coop managers must submit a cease fishing report to NMFS indicating that harvesting has concluded for the year. At any time after greater than 80 percent of the Mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation has been harvested, the Regional Administrator may contact designated coop managers to determine whether they intend to continue fishing. When considering redistribution of non-whiting catch allocation, the Regional Administrator will take in to consideration the best available data on total projected fishing impacts. Reapportionment between permitted MS coops and the non-coop fishery within the mothership sector will be in proportion to their original coop allocations for the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Set-aside species. No inseason management actions are associated with set asides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Announcements. The Regional Administrator will announce in the Federal Register when the mothership sector or the allocation of Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish with an allocation is reached, or is projected to be reached, and specify the appropriate action. In order to prevent exceeding an allocation and to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of Pacific whiting, or reapportionment of non-whiting groundfish with allocations may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishers and processors, by e-mail, internet (www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Fishery-Management/Whiting-Management/index.cfm), phone, fax, letter, press release, and/or USCG Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the Federal Register, in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Redistribution of annual allocation--(i) Between permitted MS coops (inter-coop). (A) Through an inter-coop agreement, the designated coop managers of permitted MS coops may distribute Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish allocations among one or more permitted MS coops, provided the processor obligations at paragraph (c)(7) of this section have been met or a mutual agreement exception at paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section has been submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Between permitted MS coops (inter-coop). (A) Through an inter-coop agreement, the designated coop managers of permitted MS coops may distribute Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish allocations among one or more permitted MS coops, provided the processor obligations at paragraph (c)(7) of this section have been met or a mutual agreement exception at paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section has been submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Through an inter-coop agreement, the designated coop managers of permitted MS coops may distribute Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish allocations among one or more permitted MS coops, provided the processor obligations at paragraph (c)(7) of this section have been met or a mutual agreement exception at paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section has been submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a MS coop failure during the Pacific whiting primary season for the mothership sector, unused allocation associated with the catch history will not be available for harvest by the coop that failed, by any former members of the coop that failed, or any other MS coop for the remainder of that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Between the MS coop and non-coop fisheries. Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the coop and non-coop fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Between Pacific whiting sectors. Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the mothership sector and catcher/processor sector. Whiting may not be redistributed to the Shorebased IFQ Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Processor obligation and mutual agreement exceptions--(i) Processor obligation. Through the annual MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit renewal process, the MS/CV-endorsed permit owner must identify to NMFS to which MS permit the MS/CV permit owner intends to obligate the catch history assignment associated with that permit if they are participating in the MS coop fishery. Only one MS permit may be designated for each MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Processor obligation. Through the annual MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit renewal process, the MS/CV-endorsed permit owner must identify to NMFS to which MS permit the MS/CV permit owner intends to obligate the catch history assignment associated with that permit if they are participating in the MS coop fishery. Only one MS permit may be designated for each MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expiration of a processor obligation. Processor obligations expire at the end of each calendar year when the MS Coop Permit expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Processor obligation when MS coop allocation is redistributed. When a permitted MS coop redistributes Pacific whiting allocation within the permitted MS coop or from one permitted MS coop to another permitted MS coop through an inter-coop agreement, such allocations must be delivered to the mothership registered to the MS permit to which the allocation was obligated under the processor obligation submitted to NMFS, unless a mutual agreement exception has been submitted to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Mutual agreement exception. An MS/CV-endorsed permit's catch history assignment can be released from a processor obligation through a mutual agreement exception. The MS/CV-endorsed permit owner must submit a copy to NMFS of the written agreement that includes the initial MS permit owner's acknowledgment of the release of the MS/CV-endorsed permit owner's processor obligation and the MS/CV-endorsed permit owner must identify a processor obligation for a new MS permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> MS permit withdrawal. If an MS permit withdraws from the mothership fishery before the resulting amounts of catch history assignment have been announced by NMFS, any MS/CV-endorsed permit obligated to the MS permit may elect to participate in the coop or non-coop fishery. In such an event, the MS permit owner must provide written notification of its withdrawal to NMFS and all MS/CV-endorsed permits that are obligated to the MS permit, and the owner of each MS/CV-endorsed permit obligated to the MS permit must provide written notification to NMFS of their intent to either participate in the non-coop fishery or the coop fishery, and if participating in the coop fishery must identify a processor obligation for a new MS permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Submission of a mutual agreement exception or MS permit withdrawal. Written notification of a mutual exception agreement or MS permit withdrawal must be submitted to NMFS, Northwest Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way, NE., Seattle, WA 98115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> MS coop permit and agreement--(1) Eligibility and registration. (i) Eligibility. To be an eligible coop entity a group of MS/CV-endorsed permit owners (coop members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and represent all of the coop members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility and registration. (i) Eligibility. To be an eligible coop entity a group of MS/CV-endorsed permit owners (coop members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and represent all of the coop members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eligibility. To be an eligible coop entity a group of MS/CV-endorsed permit owners (coop members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and represent all of the coop members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Annual registration and deadline. Each year, a coop entity intending to participate as a coop under the MS Coop Program must submit an application for a MS coop permit between February 1 and March 31 of the year in which it intends to fish. NMFS will not consider any applications received after March 31. A MS coop permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application for MS coop permit. The designated coop manager, on behalf of the coop entity, must submit a complete application form and include each of the items listed in paragraph

(d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Only complete applications will be considered for issuance of a MS coop permit. An application will not be considered complete if any required application fees and annual coop reports have not been received by NMFS. NMFS may request additional supplemental documentation as necessary to make a determination of whether to approve or disapprove the application. Application forms and instruction are available on the NMFS NWR Web site (http://www.nwr.noaa.gov) or by request from NMFS. The designated coop manager must sign the application acknowledging the responsibilities of a designated coop manager defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For permit owners with more than one MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA, paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(D) of this section specifies how to join an MS coop(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Coop agreement. Signed copies of the coop agreement must be submitted to NMFS before the coop is authorized to engage in fishing activities. A coop agreement must include all of the information listed in this paragraph to be considered a complete coop agreement. NMFS will only review complete coop agreements. A coop agreement will not be accepted unless it includes all of the required information; the descriptive items listed in this paragraph appear to meet the stated purpose; and information submitted is correct and accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coop agreement contents. Each coop agreement must be signed by all of the coop members (MS/CV-endorsed permit owners) and include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A list of all vessels and permit owners participating in the coop and their share of the allocated catch history assignments which must match the amount distributed to individual permit owners by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All MS/CV-endorsed limited entry member permits identified by permit number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A processor obligation clause indicating that each MS/CV-endorsed permit has notified a specific MS permit by September 1 of the previous year of that MS/CV-endorsed permit's intent to obligate its catch history assignment to that MS permit, except that for the 2011 fishery, such notification must have been made prior to submission of the MS coop permit application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A clause indicting that each member MS/CV-endorsed permit's catch history assignment is based on the catch history assignment calculation by NMFS used for distribution to the coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A description of the coop's plan to adequately monitor and account for the catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish allocations, and to monitor and account for the catch of prohibited species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A clause stating that if a permit is registered to a new permit owner during the effective period of the coop agreement, any new owners of that member permit would be coop members required to comply with membership restrictions in the coop agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A description of the coop's enforcement and penalty provisions adequate to maintain catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish within the allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A description of measures to reduce catch of overfished species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A clause describing the co-op manager's responsibility for managing inter-coop reassignments of catch history assignment, should any occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A clause describing how the annual report will be produced to document the coop's catch, bycatch data, inseason catch history reassignments and any other significant activities undertaken by the coop during the year, and the submission deadlines for that report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Identification of the designated coop manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Provisions that prohibit member permit owners that have incurred legal sanctions that prevent them from fishing groundfish in the Council region from fishing in the coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inter-coop agreement. The coop entity must provide, at the time of annual application, copies of any inter-coop agreement(s) into which the coop has entered. Such agreements must incorporate and honor the provisions of the individual coop agreements for each coop that is a party to the inter-coop agreement. Inter-coop agreements

are specified at paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Acceptance of a coop agreement--(1) If NMFS does not accept the coop agreement, the coop permit application will be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons the coop agreement was not accepted by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coop agreements that are not accepted may be resubmitted for review by sufficiently addressing the deficiencies identified in the NMFS letter and resubmitting the entire coop permit application by the date specified in the NMFS letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An accepted coop agreement that was submitted with the MS coop permit application and for which a MS coop permit was issued will remain in place through the end of the calendar year.

The coop may resubmit the coop agreement with further revisions to the material changes responding to NMFS concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date of MS coop permit. A MS coop permit will be effective upon the date approved by NMFS and will allow fishing from the start of the MS sector primary whiting season until the end of the calendar year or until one or more of the following events occur, whichever comes first:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> NMFS permanently closes the mothership sector fishing season for the year or a specific MS coop or the designated coop manager notifies NMFS that the coop has completed fishing for the calendar year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The coop has reached its Pacific whiting allocation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A material change to the coop agreement has occurred and the designated coop manager failed to notify NMFS within 7 calendar days of the material change and submit to NMFS the revised coop agreement with a letter that describes such changes within 30 calendar days, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> NMFS has determined that a coop failure occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial administrative determination. For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD that either approves or disapproves the application. If approved, the IAD will include a MS coop permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. The IAD for a MS coop permit follows the same requirement as specified for limited entry permits at Sec. 660.25(g)(4)(ii); if the applicant does not appeal the IAD within the 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appeals. An appeal to a MS coop permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees.

Any vessel that processes or receives deliveries as a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS permit. A vessel registered to an MS permit may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in an MS coop and/or may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in the non-coop fishery at the same time or during the same year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Vessel size endorsement. An MS permit does not have a vessel size endorsement. The endorsement provisions at Sec. 660.25(b)(3)(iii), subpart C, do not apply to an MS permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Restriction on C/P vessels operating as motherships. Restrictions on a vessel registered to a limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement operating as a mothership are specified at Sec. 660.160, subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Renewal, change of permit ownership, or vessel registration--(i) Renewal. An MS permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4). If a vessel registered to the MS permit will operate as a mothership in the year for which the permit is renewed, the permit owner must make a declaration as part of the permit renewal that while participating in the whiting fishery it will operate solely as a mothership during the calendar year to which its limited entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for the calendar year, even if the permit is registered to a different permit owner during the year, unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit owner.

An MS permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Accumulation limits--(i) MS permit usage limit. No person who owns an MS permit(s) may register the MS permit(s) to vessels that cumulatively process more than 45 percent of the annual mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation. For purposes of determining accumulation limits, NMFS requires that permit owners submit a complete trawl ownership interest form for the permit owner as part of annual renewal for the MS permit. An ownership interest form will also be required whenever a new permit owner obtains an MS permit as part of a request for a change in permit ownership. Accumulation limits will be determined by calculating the percentage of ownership interest a person has in any MS permit.

The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the

issuance of an MS permit consistent with the provisions given at Sec. 660.25(f), Subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cost recovery. The owner of a vessel registered to an MS permit, the operator of a vessel registered to an MS permit, and the owner of the MS permit registered to that vessel, are considered to be the fish buyer as defined at Sec. 660.111, and must comply with the cost recovery program specified at Sec. 660.115.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Mothership catcher vessel (MS/CV)--endorsed permit--(1) General. Any vessel that delivers whiting to a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit, except that a vessel registered to limited entry trawl permit without an MS/CV or C/P endorsement may fish for a coop if authorized by the coop. Within the MS Coop Program, an MS/CV-endorsed permit may participate in an MS coop or in the non-coop fishery.

Within the MS Coop Program, an MS/CV-endorsed permit may participate in an MS coop or in the non-coop fishery. An MS/CV-endorsed permit is a limited entry permit and is subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at Sec. 660.25(b), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catch history assignment. NMFS will assign a catch history assignment to each MS/CV-endorsed permit. The catch history assignment is based on the catch history in the Pacific whiting mothership sector during the qualifying years of 1994 through 2003. The catch history assignment is expressed as a percentage of Pacific whiting of the total mothership sector allocation as described at paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Catch history assignments will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules (i.e. decimal amounts from zero up to 0.5 round down and 0.5 up to 1.0 round up).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pacific whiting mothership sector allocation. The catch history assignment allocation accrues to the coop to which the MS/CV-endorsed permit is tied through private agreement, or will be assigned to the non-coop fishery if the MS/CV-endorsed permit does not participate in the coop fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> MS/CV endorsement and CHA non-severable. Subject to the regulations at paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, an MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are permanently linked together as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Restrictions on processing for MS/CV-endorsed permits. A vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit in a given year shall not engage in processing of Pacific whiting during that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Renewal, change of permit owner, vessel registration, or combination--(i) Renewal. An MS/CV-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4). During renewal, all MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners must make a preliminary declaration regarding their intent to participate in the coop or non-coop portion of the MS Coop Program for the following year. If the owner of a MS/CV-endorsed permit intends to participate in the coop portion of the MS Coop Program, they must also declare to which MS permit they intend to obligate the permit's catch history assignment. MS/CV-endorsed permits not obligated to a permitted MS coop by March 31 of the fishing year will be assigned to the non-coop fishery. For an MS/CV-endorsed permit that is not renewed, the following occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Renewal. An MS/CV-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4).

For an MS/CV-endorsed permit that is not renewed, the following occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the first year after the permit is not renewed, the permit will be extinguished, and the catch history assignment from that permit will be assigned to the non-coop fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the year after the permit is extinguished (the second year after the permit is not renewed), the catch history assignment from that permit will be redistributed proportionally to all valid MS/CV-endorsed permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change of permit ownership. An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Change of vessel registration. An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to

the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at Sec. 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Change in MS/CV endorsement registration. As specified at Sec. 660.25(b)(3)(v), each MS/CV endorsement has an associated CHA that is permanently linked as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit. Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration will be registered separately on the limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA cannot be registered to any other person other than the specified owner of the limited entry trawl permit to which it is registered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Multiple MS/CV endorsements on a limited entry trawl permit. Multiple MS/CV endorsements and associated CHAs may be registered to a single limited entry trawl permit. If multiple endorsements are registered to a single limited entry trawl permit, the whiting CHA amount (expressed as a percent) will remain in the amount that it was originally issued by NMFS and will not be combined as a single larger CHA, unless two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits are combined for purposes of increasing the size endorsement, as specified at Sec. 660.25(b)(4)(ii)(B). Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration may be disapproved if the person owning the limited entry trawl permit has aggregate CHA amounts in excess of the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application. NMFS will begin accepting applications for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration beginning September 1, 2014. A request for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be made between September 1 and December 31 of each year. Any transfer of MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA to another limited entry trawl permit must be requested using a Change in Registration of a Mothership/Catcher Vessel Endorsement/Catch History Assignment Application form and the permit owner or an authorized representative of the permit owner must certify that the application is true and correct by signing and dating the form. In addition, the form must be notarized, and the permit owner selling the MS/CV endorsement and its CHA must provide the sale price of the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA. If any assets in addition to the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are included in the sale price, those assets must be itemized and described.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date. Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration from one limited entry trawl permit to another limited entry trawl permit will be effective on January 1 in the year following the application period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A limited entry trawl permit owner with multiple MS/CV-endorsements and associated CHA on a single permit may assign each distinct MS/CV endorsement and catch history assignment separately to coop(s) or the non-coop fishery. In such cases, as part of the coop permit application process, specified at paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the permit owner must specify on the coop permit application form which MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA is specifically registered to a particular coop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Combination. An MS/CV-endorsed permit may be combined with one or more other limited entry trawl permits; the resulting permit will be a single permit with an increased size endorsement. If the MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit other than a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be MS/CV-endorsed. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be exclusively a C/P-endorsed permit, and will not have an MS/CV endorsement. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another MS/CV-endorsed permit, the combined catch history assignment of the permit(s) will be added to the active permit (the permit remaining after combination) and the other permit will be retired. If a trawl permit has more than one MS/CV endorsements and it is combined with a non C/P-endorsed trawl permit with no such endorsements, the MS/CV endorsements on the resulting permit will be

maintained as separate endorsements on the resulting permit. NMFS will not approve a permit combination if it results in a person exceeding the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Any request to combine permits is subject to the provision provided at Sec. 660.25(b), including the combination formula for resulting size endorsements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> One-time request to undo a permit combination. If two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits have been combined before January 1, 2012 for purposes of increasing the vessel's size endorsement, a permit owner of the resulting combined permit will have until February 29, 2012 to undo that permit combination. The permit owner must submit a letter to NMFS requesting such action. The letter must be postmarked or hand-delivered to NMFS by the deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Accumulation limits--(i) MS/CV-endorsed permit ownership limit. No person shall own MS/CV-endorsed permits for which the collective Pacific whiting allocation total is greater than 20 percent of the total mothership sector allocation. For purposes of determining accumulation limits, NMFS requires that permit owners submit a complete trawl ownership interest form for the permit owner as part of annual renewal of an MS/CV-endorsed permit. An ownership interest form will also be required whenever a new permit owner obtains an MS/CV-endorsed permit as part of a request for a change in permit ownership. Accumulation limits will be determined by calculating the percentage of ownership interest a person has in any MS/CV-endorsed permit and the amount of the Pacific whiting catch history assignment given on the permit.

Any person that owns a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or renewing an MS/CV endorsement shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the permit greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will not issue an MS/CV endorsement unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits. Further, if SFD discovers through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a person owns or controls more than the accumulation limits, the person will be subject to divestiture provisions specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Divestiture. For MS/CV-endorsed permit owners that are found to exceed the accumulation limits during the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, an adjustment period will be provided during which they will have to completely divest of ownership in permits that exceed the accumulation limits. Any person that NMFS determines, as a result of the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, to own in excess of 20 percent of the total catch history assignment in the MS Coop Program applying the individual and collective rule described at Sec. 660.150(g)(3)(i)(A) will be allowed to receive such permit(s), but must divest themselves of the excess ownership by August 31, 2016. Owners of such permit(s) may receive and use the MS/CV-endorsed permit(s), up to the time their divestiture is completed. After August 31, 2016, any MS/CV-endorsed permits owned by a person (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner named on the permit) in excess of the accumulation limits will

not be issued (renewed) until the permit owner complies with the accumulation limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catcher vessel usage limit. No vessel may catch more than 30 percent of the mothership sector's whiting allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appeals.

NMFS will calculate relative history for each year in the qualifying period from 1994 through 2003 by dividing the total deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships for the vessel(s) registered to the permit for each year by the sum of the total catch of Pacific whiting delivered to mothership vessel(s) for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> NMFS will select the eight years with the highest relative history of Pacific whiting, unless the applicant requests a different set of eight years during the initial issuance and appeals process, and will add the relative histories for these years to generate the permit's total relative history. NMFS will then divide the permit's total relative history by the sum of all qualifying permits' total relative histories

to determine the permit's catch history assignment, expressed as a percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The total relative history will include any deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships by vessels registered to limited entry trawl-endorsed permits that were subsequently combined to generate the current permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will split the catch history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> History of illegal deliveries will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment or in the calculation of relative history for individual years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Deliveries made from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Deliveries made under provisional ``A'' permits that did not become ``A'' permits and ``B'' permits will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> MS/CV endorsement and catch history assignment application. Persons may apply for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit and its associated catch history assignment in one of two ways: complete and submit a prequalified application received from NMFS, or complete and submit an application package. The completed application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive consideration for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prequalified application. A ``prequalified application'' is a partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined the catch history that may qualify the applicant for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail prequalified application packages to the owners of current limited entry trawl permits, as listed in the NMFS permit database at the time applications are mailed, which NMFS determines may qualify for an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail the application by certified mail to the current address of record in the NMFS permit database. The application will contain the basis of NMFS' calculation. The application package will include, but is not limited to: a prequalified application (with landings history), a Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest form, and any other documents NMFS believes are necessary to aid the limited entry permit owner in completing the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Request for an application. Any owner of a current limited entry trawl permit that does not receive a prequalified application that believes the permit qualifies for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment must complete an application package and submit the completed application to NMFS by the application deadline. Application packages are available on the NMFS Web site (http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Groundfish-Halibut/Groundfish-Permits/index.cfm) or by contacting SFD. An application must include valid NORPAC data, copies of NMFS observer data forms, or other credible information that substantiates the applicant's qualification for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Corrections to the application. If the applicant does not accept NMFS' calculation in the prequalified application either in part or whole, in order for NMFS to reconsider NMFS' calculation, the applicant must identify in writing to NMFS which parts of the application that the applicant contends to be inaccurate, and must provide specific credible information to substantiate any requested corrections. The

completed application and specific credible information must be provided to NMFS in writing by the application deadline. Written communication must be either post-marked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. Requests for corrections may only be granted for changes to the selection of the eight years with the highest relative history of whiting and errors in NMFS' use or application of data, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Errors in NMFS' use or application of data from NORPAC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Errors in NMFS' calculations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Errors in the identification of the permit owner, permit combinations, or vessel registration as listed in the NMFS permit database; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Errors in NMFS' use or application of ownership interest information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Submission of the application and application deadline--(A) Submission of the application.

A complete, certified application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours to NMFS, Northwest Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115, no later than November 1, 2010. NMFS will not accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the application deadline. There are no hardship provisions for this deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Permit transfer during application period. NMFS will not review or approve any request for a change in limited entry trawl permit owner at any time after either November 1, 2010 or the date upon which the application is received by NMFS, whichever occurs first, until a final decision is made by the Regional Administrator on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce on that permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Initial Administrative Determination (IAD). NMFS will issue an IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the applicant will receive an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit specifying the amounts of catch history assignment for which the applicant has qualified. If NMFS disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons. If known at the time of the IAD, NMFS will indicate if the owner of the MS/CV-endorsed permit has ownership interest in catch history assignments that exceed the accumulation limits and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Appeals. For an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at Sec. 660.25(g), subpart C. For the initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (g)(6)(v) of this
