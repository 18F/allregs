                                Sec. 778.411  Sixty-hour limit on pay guaranteed by contract.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The amount of weekly pay guaranteed may not exceed compensation due  at the specified regular rate for the applicable maximum hours standard  and at the specified overtime rate for the additional hours, not to  exceed a total of 60 hours. Thus, if the maximum hours standard is 40  hours and the specified regular rate is $5 an hour the weekly guaranty  cannot be greater than $350. This does not mean that an employee  employed pursuant to a guaranteed pay contract under this section may  not work more than 60 hours in any week; it means merely that pay in an  amount sufficient to compensate for a greater number of hours cannot be  covered by the guaranteed pay. If he works in excess of 60 hours he must  be paid, for each hour worked in excess of 60, overtime compensation as  provided in the contract, in addition to the guaranteed amount.
