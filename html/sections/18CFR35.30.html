                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This subpart applies to any sales of electric  power subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Part II of the  Federal Power Act from public utilities to the Administrator of the  Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) at the average system cost (ASC)  of that utility's resources (electric power generation by the utility)  pursuant to section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power  Planning and Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 830-839h. The ASC is determined  by BPA in accordance with 18 CFR part 301.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effectiveness of rates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the period between the date  of BPA's determination of ASC and the date of the final order issued by  the Commission, the utility may charge the rate based on the ASC  determined by BPA, subject to Sec. 35.31(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided under this section, the ASC ordered  by the Commission will be deemed in effect from the beginning of the  relevant exchange period, as defined in Sec. 301.1(b)(95) of this  chapter. For any initial exchange period after the Commission approves a  new ASC methodology, the ASC will be effective retroactively under this  paragraph only if the utility files its new ASC within the time allowed  under BPA procedures. Any utility that files a revised ASC with BPA in  accordance with this paragraph must promptly file with the Commission a  notice of timely filing of the new ASC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, and any other material requested by the Commission or its  staff.
