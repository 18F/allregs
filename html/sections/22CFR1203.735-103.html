                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Counseling services on employee responsibilities and conduct are  available in each agency. These services are to be coordinated by a  Counselor appointed by the agency head. The Counselor for IDCA is the  General Counsel. The Counselor serves as the agency's designee to the  Civil Service Commission on matters covered by the regulations in this  part and is responsible for coordination of the agency's counseling  services under paragraph (b) of this section and for assuring that  counseling and interpretations on questions of conflicts of interest and  other matters covered by these sections are available to deputy  counselors designated under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each agency head may designate deputy counselors for the  agency's employees and special Government employees. Deputy Counselors  designated under this section must be qualified and in a position to  give authoritative advice and guidance to each employee and special  Government employee who seeks advice and guidance on questions of  conflicts of interest and on other matters covered by the regulations in  this part. A Washington employee or special Government employee should  address any inquiries concerning the regulations in this part to the  Counselor. At missions abroad the chief of each agency's establishment  designates an officer, preferably the legal officer where one is  available, to provide counseling services under the guidance of the  Counselor; a single officer may serve all agencies. An employee or  special Government employee serving abroad should submit inquiries to  the officer designated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each agency shall periodically notify its employees and special  Government employees of the availability of counseling services and how  and when   these services are available. A new employee or special Government  employee shall be notified at the time of entrance on duty.</p>
