In the case of a position with a single rate under such a schedule, the single rate of basic pay for that position is the comparison rate.</p><p class="depth0">Covered pay system means a covered pay schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5361(5)--i.e., the General Schedule pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III; a prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; or a special occupational pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IX. The various prevailing rate systems under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, are considered separate systems if they have separate job grading structures.</p><p class="depth0">Employed on a temporary or term basis means employment under an appointment having a definite time limitation or designated as temporary or term.</p><p class="depth0">Employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that employee also includes--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An individual employed by a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) who is moved without a break in service of more than 3 days from employment in such an instrumentality to a position under a covered pay system in the same agency.</p><p class="depth2">FEPCA means the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended).</p><p class="depth2">General Schedule or GS means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. This term also refers to the pay schedule established under 5 U.S.C. 5332.</p><p class="depth2">Highest applicable rate range means the rate range applicable to an employee based on a given position of record and official worksite that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any retained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305 may exceed an applicable locality rate range under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for General Schedule employees. In certain circumstances, the highest applicable rate range may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules--e.g., a range where special rates are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range.</p><p class="depth2">Management action means an action (not for personal cause) by an agency official not initiated or requested by an employee which may adversely affect the employee's grade or rate of basic pay. However, an employee's placement in or transfer to a position under a formal employee development program established by an agency for recruitment and employee advancement purposes (e.g., Recent Graduates Program) is considered a management action even though the employee initiates or requests such placement or transfer.</p><p class="depth2">Official worksite means the official location of the employee's position of record as determined under the rules of the applicable pay system (e.g., 5 CFR 531.605 for General Schedule employees). Official worksite is synonymous with the term ``official duty station'' as used in 5 U.S.C. 5363(c).</p><p class="depth2">OPM means the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth2">Payable rate means the highest rate of basic pay to which an employee is entitled based on the employee's position of record, official worksite, and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) or, if applicable, a retained rate.</p><p class="depth2">Pay schedule means a set of rate ranges established under a single authority--i.e., the General Schedule, a law enforcement officer special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10) under section 403 of FEPCA; a prevailing rate schedule (including a special schedule or special rate schedule) under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on GS rates; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on law enforcement officer special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10); or a special rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar authority. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.</p><p class="depth2">Position of record means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.</p><p class="depth2">Prevailing rate employee has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5342(a)(2) and refers to an employee in a position covered by a prevailing rate system or schedule established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV.</p><p class="depth2">Rate of basic pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions, including a General Schedule rate under 5 U.S.C. 5332; a law enforcement officer special base rate under section 403 of FEPCA; a special rate under 5 CFR part 530,

subpart C, or similar payment under other legal authority; a locality rate under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F, or similar payment under other legal authority; a prevailing rate under 5 U.S.C. 5343; or a retained rate under this part, but excluding additional pay of any other kind (such as premium payments, differentials, and allowances).</p><p class="depth2">Rate range or range means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate.</p><p class="depth2">Reasonable offer means an offer that meets the conditions in Sec. 536.104.</p><p class="depth2">Reduced in grade or pay at the employee's request means a reduction in grade or rate of basic pay that is initiated by the employee for his or her benefit, convenience, or personal advantage. A reduction in grade or pay that is caused or influenced by a management action is not considered to be at an employee's request, except that the voluntary reduction in grade or pay of an employee in response to a management action directly related to personal cause is considered to be at the employee's request.</p><p class="depth2">Reduced in grade or pay for personal cause means a reduction in grade or rate of basic pay based on the conduct, character, or unacceptable performance of an employee. In situations in which an employee is reduced in grade or pay for inability to perform the duties of his or her position because of a medical or physical condition beyond the employee's control, the reduction in grade or pay is not considered to be for personal cause.</p><p class="depth2">Reorganization means the planned elimination, addition, redistribution, or restructuring of functions or duties either wholly within an agency or between agencies.</p><p class="depth2">Retained rate means a rate above the maximum rate of the employee's highest applicable rate range that is payable under subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Temporary promotion means a promotion that has a definite time limitation or is otherwise designated as temporary when the affected employee is informed in advance.</p><p class="depth2">Temporary reassignment means a reassignment that has a definite time limitation or is otherwise designated as temporary when the affected employee is informed in advance.</p><p class="depth2">Where different pay schedules apply means, in the context of applying the geographic conversion rule, that an employee's official worksite is changed to a new location that would cause the employee to lose or gain coverage under a location-based pay schedule if the employee were to remain in the same position of record.
