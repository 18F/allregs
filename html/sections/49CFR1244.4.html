                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one of the following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of audited revenue waybills--the manual system (Sec.  1244.3(b)). (2) A computer tape containing specified information from a sample of waybills--the computerized system (Sec.  1244.3(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Manual System. (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sample of subject waybills shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers are 1 or end in 01,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1 or 7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Expected</p><p class="depth3">Numbers of carloads on waybill                   sample</p><p class="depth3">rate------------------------------------------------------------------------1 to 5........................................................    1/1006 to 25.......................................................     1/1026 and over...................................................      1/5------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon giving the subject roads 60 days notice, the Board may require random serial number endings in lieu of the respective endings shown in Sec.  1244.3(b). These random serial number endings would have the expected sample rates shown in Sec.  1244.3(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the subject waybills have no waybill numbers or serial numbers, or have seriously flawed waybill or serial numbers, then the subject railroad should serialize those documents in blocks of 1,000 or blocks of multiples of 1,000 (e.g., 1, 2, . . . 1,000; 1, 2, . . .) and use these constructed serial numbers for selection purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Computerized System. (1) The tape shall be required to conform to the standards and format specified in Statement No. 81-1, Procedure for Sampling Waybill Records by Computer (2009 edition), issued by the Surface Transportation Board. The Director of the Federal Register has approved this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. To enforce any editions other than those specified in this section, the STB must publish notice of change in the Federal Register and the material must be available to the public. You may obtain or inspect a copy of these standards from the Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20423-0001; from the Surface Transportation Board Web site at http://www.stb.dot.gov; or by calling (202) 245-0323.
