                                Sec. 423.272  Review and negotiation of bid and approval of plans
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review and negotiation regarding information, terms and  conditions. CMS reviews the information filed under Sec. 423.265(c) in  order to conduct negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of the  proposed bid and benefit plan. In addition to its general negotiating  authority under section 1860D-11(d)(2)(A) of the Act, CMS has authority  similar to that of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management  for health benefit plans under Chapter 89 of title 5, U.S.C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval of proposed plans. CMS approves the Part D plan only if  the   plan and the Part D sponsor offering the plan comply with all applicable  CMS Part D requirements, including those related to the provision of  qualified prescription drug coverage and actuarial determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application of revenue requirements standard. CMS approves a bid  submitted under Sec. 423.265 only if it determines that the portions of  the bid attributable to basic and supplemental prescription drug  coverage are supported by the actuarial bases provided and reasonably  and equitably reflect the revenue requirements (as used for purposes of  section 1302(8)(C) of the Public Health Service Act) for benefits  provided under that plan, less the sum (determined on a monthly per  capita basis) of the actuarial value of the reinsurance payments under  Sec. 423.329(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plan design. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CMS does not approve a bid if it finds that the  design of the plan and its benefits (including any formulary and tiered  formulary structure) or its utilization management program are likely to  substantially discourage enrollment by certain Part D eligible  individuals under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the design of the categories and classes within a formulary  is consistent with the model guidelines (if any) established by the  United States Pharmacopeia, the formulary categories and classes alone  will not be found to discourage enrollment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A plan that adopts the categories and classes discussed in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section may nevertheless be found to  discourage enrollment because it excludes specific drugs from the  formulary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substantial differences between bids--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. CMS approves  a bid only if it finds that the benefit package or plan costs  represented by that bid are substantially different as provided under  Sec. 423.265(b)(2) of this subpart from the benefit package or plan  costs represented by another bid submitted by the same Part D sponsor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transition period for PDP sponsors with new acquisitions. After  a 2-year transition period, as determined by CMS, CMS approves a bid  offered by a PDP sponsor (or by a parent organization to that PDP  sponsor) that recently purchased (or otherwise acquired or merged with)  another Part D sponsor if it finds that the benefit package or plan  costs represented by that bid are substantially different from any  benefit package or plan costs represented by another bid submitted by  the same Part D sponsor (or parent organization to that Part D sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CMS may decline to approve a bid if the Part D sponsor proposes  significant increases in cost sharing or decreases in benefits offered  under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited risk plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application of limited risk plans. There  is no limit on the number of full risk plans that CMS approves under  paragraph (b) of this section. CMS approves a limited risk plan in  accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section only if the  access requirements under Sec. 423.859 are not otherwise met for a PDP  region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maximizing assumption of risk. CMS gives priority in approval  for those limited risk plans bearing the highest level of risk, but may  take into account the level of the bids submitted by the plans and is  not required to accept the limited risk plan with the highest assumption  of risk. In no case does CMS approve a limited risk plan under which the  modification of risk level provides for no (or a minimal) level of  financial risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limited exercise of authority. CMS approves only the minimum  number of limited risk plans needed to meet the access requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules for private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans that  offer prescription drug coverage. PFFS plans (as defined at  Sec. 422.4(a)(3)) choosing to offer prescription drug coverage are  subject to all MA-PD bid submission and approval requirements applicable  to MA-PD plans with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements regarding negotiated prices. These plans are not  required to provide access to negotiated prices. However, if they do,  they must meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 423.104(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Modification of pharmacy access standard and disclosure  requirement. If the plan provides coverage for drugs purchased from all  pharmacies, without charging additional cost sharing and without regard  to whether they are network pharmacies, Secs. 423.120(a) and 423.132  requiring certain network access standards and the disclosure of the  availability of lower cost bioequivalent generic drugs does not apply to  the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for plans with standardized bids sufficiently below  the national average monthly bid to result in a negative premium. In the  event of a negative premium, as described in Sec. 423.286(d)(1), CMS  negotiates the incorporation of the negative premium amount into the bid  as either a reduction in the supplemental premium if the Part D plan  already submitted a bid with an enhanced alternative benefit, or CMS  requires the addition of new enhanced alternative benefit of no less  value than the amount of the negative premium.
