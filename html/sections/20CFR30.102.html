                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee previously awarded impairment benefits by OWCP may  file a claim for additional impairment benefits. Such claim must be  based on an increase in the employee's minimum impairment rating  attributable to the covered illness or illnesses from the impairment  rating that formed the basis for the last award of such benefits by  OWCP. OWCP will only adjudicate claims for such an increased rating that  are filed at least two years from the date of the last award of  impairment benefits. However, OWCP will not wait two years before it  will adjudicate a claim for additional impairment that is based on an  allegation that the employee sustained a new covered illness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee previously awarded wage-loss benefits by OWCP may be  eligible for additional wage-loss benefits for periods of wage-loss that  were not addressed in a prior claim only if the employee had not reached  his or her Social Security retirement age at the time of the prior  award. OWCP will adjudicate claims filed on a yearly basis in connection  with each succeeding calendar year for which qualifying wage-loss under  Part E is alleged, as well as claims that aggregate calendar years for  which qualifying wage-loss is alleged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees should use Form EE-10 to claim for additional  impairment or wage-loss benefits under Part E of EEOICPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee, or the person filing the claim on behalf of the  employee, shall affirm that the information provided on Form EE-10 is  true, and must inform OWCP of any subsequent changes to that  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee is responsible for submitting with any claim filed  under this section, or arranging for the submission of, factual and  medical evidence establishing that he or she experienced another  calendar year of qualifying wage-loss, and/or medical evidence  establishing that he or she has an increased minimum impairment rating,  as appropriate.</p>
