                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The PBGC may in its discretion extend a deadline for  taking action under this subpart to a later date. The PBGC will grant  such an extension where it finds compelling reasons why it is not  administratively feasible for the plan administrator (or other persons  acting on behalf of the plan administrator) to take the action until the  later date and the delay is brief. The PBGC will consider--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of the delay; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to  meet the deadline is exercised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time of extension request. Any request for an extension under  paragraph (a) of this section that is filed later than the 15th day  before the applicable deadline must include a justification for not  filing the request earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>  for submitting a determination letter request to the IRS (in order to  qualify for the distribution deadline in Sec. 4041.28(a)(1)(ii)) will be  deemed to be granted unless the PBGC notifies the plan administrator  otherwise within 60 days after receipt of the request (or, if later, by  the end of the PBGC's review period under Sec. 4041.26(a)). The PBGC  will notify the plan administrator in writing of the date on which it  receives such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Statutory deadlines not extendable. The PBGC will not--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pre-distribution deadlines. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Extend the 60-day time limit  under Sec. 4041.23(a) for issuing the notice of intent to terminate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Waive the requirement in Sec. 4041.24(a) that the notice of  plan benefits be issued by the time the plan administrator files the  standard termination notice with the PBGC; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Post-distribution deadlines. Extend the deadline under  Sec. 4041.29(a) for filing   the post-distribution certification. However, the PBGC will assess a  penalty for late filing of a post-distribution certification only under  the circumstances described in Sec. 4041.29(b).</p>
