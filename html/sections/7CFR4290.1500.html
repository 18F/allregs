                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Restriction on distribution. If you have outstanding Leverage, whenever you make a distribution to your investors you must make, at the same time, a prepayment to or for the benefit of the third-party holder of the Debenture sold pursuant to Sec. 4290.1240 of this part, accrued unpaid interest and the principal, in whole or in part, of one or more of your Debentures outstanding as of the date of the distribution (subject to the terms of such Debentures).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount of prepayment. You must calculate the amount due the third-party holder by multiplying the total amount you intend to distribute by a fraction whose numerator is the outstanding principal of your Debenture(s) immediately preceding your distribution, and whose denominator is the sum of your Leverageable Capital as of that time plus the outstanding principal amount of your Debentures. For purposes of the preceding sentence ``principal'' means both the net proceeds and interest accrued to date of a discounted Debenture. The amount of any payment received under this section will be credited first against unpaid interest accrued to the date of distribution and then to the principal in whole or in part of the first Debenture you select to prepay and then to the interest and principal in whole or in part of such other Debenture(s) as you select to prepay. You may elect to prepay in whole any discounted Debenture under this section only within five years of its maturity date. Payments under this section must be made on the next occurring March 1 or September 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of prepayment. Subject to the terms of the Debenture(s), you may voluntarily prepay additional principal, but neither mandatory nor voluntary prepayment will increase your future Leverage eligibility.</p><p class="depth2">Funding Leverage by Use of Guaranteed Trust Certificates (``TCs'')</p>
