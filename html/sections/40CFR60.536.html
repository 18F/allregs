If an adjustable burn rate wood heater or pellet stove belongs to a model line certified under Sec. 60.533, and no wood heater in the model line has been found to exceed the applicable emission limits or tolerances through quality assurance testing, one of the following statements, as appropriate, must appear on the permanent label:
``U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Certified to comply with 2015 particulate emission standards. Not approved for sale after May 15, 2020.'' or``U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Certified to comply with 2020 particulate emission standards using crib wood.'' or``U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Certified to comply with 2020 particulate emission standards using cord wood.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Permanent label requirements for single burn rate wood heaters.
