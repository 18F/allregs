Entities that have submitted a joint plan under Sec. 37.141 may submit a joint certification under this paragraph. The requirements of Sec.

Sec. 37.137-37.139 of this part on the next following January 26 and in each succeeding year until the entity returns to full compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An entity that has demonstrated undue financial burden to the FTA shall file a plan update meeting the requirements of Sec.

Each plan shall provide full compliance by no later than January 26, 1997, unless the entity has received a waiver based on undue financial burden. If the date for full compliance specified in the plan is after January 26, 1993, the plan shall include milestones, providing for measured, proportional progress toward full compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Plan implementation.
