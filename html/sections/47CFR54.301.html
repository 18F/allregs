                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of local switching support. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beginning January 1,  1998 and ending December 31, 2011, an incumbent local exchange carrier  that has been designated an eligible telecommunications carrier and that  serves a study area with 50,000 or fewer access lines shall receive  support for local switching costs using the following formula: The  carrier's projected annual unseparated local switching revenue  requirement, calculated pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, shall  be multiplied by the local switching support factor. Beginning January  1, 2012 and ending June 30, 2012, a rate-of-return carrier, as that term  is defined in Sec. 54.5 of this chapter, that is an incumbent local  exchange carrier that has been designated an eligible telecommunications  carrier and that serves a study area with 50,000 or fewer access lines  and is not affiliated with a price cap carrier, as that term is defined  in Sec. 61.3(aa) of this chapter, shall receive support for local  switching costs frozen at the same support level received for calendar  year 2011, subject to true-up. For purposes of this section, local  switching costs shall be defined as Category 3 local switching costs  under part 36 of this chapter. Beginning January 1, 2012, no carrier  that is a price cap carrier, as that term is defined in Sec. 61.3(aa)  of this chapter, or a rate-of-return carrier, as that term is defined in  Sec. 54.5 of this chapter, that is affiliated with a price cap carrier,  shall receive local switching support. Beginning July 1, 2012, no  carrier shall receive local switching support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Local switching support factor. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The local switching support  factor shall be defined as the difference between the 1996 weighted  interstate DEM factor, calculated pursuant to Sec. 36.125(f) of this  chapter, and the 1996 unweighted interstate DEM factor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the number of a study area's access lines increases such  that, under Sec. 36.125(f) of this chapter, the weighted interstate DEM  factor for 1997 or any successive year would be reduced, that lowered  weighted interstate DEM factor shall be applied to the study area's 1996  unweighted interstate DEM factor to derive a new local switching support  factor. If the number of a study area's access lines decreases or has  decreased such that, under Sec. 36.125(f) of this chapter, the weighted  interstate DEM factor for 2010 or any successive year would be raised,  that higher weighted interstate DEM factor shall be applied to the study  area's 1996 unweighted interstate DEM factor to derive a new local  switching support factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Beginning January 1, 1998, the sum of the unweighted interstate  DEM factor, as defined in Sec. 36.125(a)(5) of this chapter, and the  local switching support factor shall not exceed 0.85. If the sum of  those two factors would exceed 0.85, the local switching support factor  shall be reduced to a level that would reduce the sum of the factors to  0.85.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of data to the Administrator. Until October 1, 2011,  each incumbent local exchange carrier that has been designated an  eligible telecommunications carrier and that serves a study area with  50,000 or fewer access lines shall, for each study area, provide the  Administrator with the projected total unseparated dollar amount  assigned to each account listed below for the calendar year following  each filing. This information must be provided to the Administrator no  later than October 1 of each year.
