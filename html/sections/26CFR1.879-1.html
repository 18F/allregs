                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of community income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1976, community income of a citizen or  resident of the United States who is married to a nonresident alien  individual, and the deductions properly allocable to that income, shall  be divided between the U.S. citizen or resident spouse in accordance  with the rules in section 879 and paragraph (a)(2) through (a)(6) of  this section. This section does not apply for any taxable year with  respect to which an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is in effect.  Community income for this purpose includes all gross income, whether  derived from sources within or without the United States, which is  treated as community income of the spouses under the community property  laws of the State, foreign country, or possession of the United States  in which the recipient of the income is domiciled. Income from real  property also may be community income if so treated under the laws of  the jurisdiction in which the real property is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> does not apply, however, to the  following items of community income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Community income derived from any trade or business carried on  by the husband or the wife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Community income attributable to a spouse's distributive share  of the income of a partnership to which paragraph (a)(4) of this section  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Community income consisting of compensation for personal  services rendered to a corporation which represents a distribution of  the earnings and profits of the corporation rather than a reasonable  allowance as compensation for the personal services actually performed,  but not including any income that would be treated as earned income  under the second sentence of section 911(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Community income derived from property which is acquired as  consideration for personal services performed.  These items of community income are divided in accordance with the rules  in paragraph (a)(3) through (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, income derived from a trade or  business includes any income derived from a trade or business in which  both personal services and capital are material income producing  factors. The term ``management and control'' means management and  control in fact, not the management and control imputed to the husband  under the community property laws of a State, foreign country or  possession of the United States. For example, a wife who operates a  pharmacy without any appreciable collaboration on the part of a husband  is considered as having substantially all of the management and control  of the business despite the provisions of any community   property laws of a State, foreign country, or possession of the United  States, vesting in the husband the right of management and control of  community property. The income and deductions attributable to the  operation of the pharmacy are considered the income and deductions of  the wife.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Partnership income. If any portion of a spouse's distributive  share of the income of a partnership, of which the spouse is a member,  is community income for the taxable year, all of that distributive share  shall be treated as the income of that spouse and shall not be taken  into account in determining the income of the other spouse. If both  spouses are members of the same partnership, the distributive share of  the income of each spouse which is community income shall be treated as  the income of that spouse. A spouse's distributive share of the income  of a partnership that is community income shall be determined as  provided in section 704 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income from separate property. Any community income for the  taxable year, other than income described in section 879(a) (1) or (2)  and paragraph (a) (2), (3), or (4) of this section, which is derived  from the separate property of one of the spouses shall be treated as the  income of that spouse. The determination of what property is separate  property for this purpose shall be made in accordance with the laws of  the State, foreign country, or possession of the United States in which,  in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the recipient of  the income is domiciled or, in the case of income from real property, in  which the real property is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> applies to community  income not described in paragraph (a) (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this  section which consists of dividends, interest, rents, royalties, or  gains, from community property or of the earnings of unemancipated minor  children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. H, a U.S. citizen, and W, a nonresident alien individual,  each of whose taxable years is the calendar year, were married  throughout 1977. H and W were residents of, and domiciled in, foreign  country Z during the entire taxable year. No election under section 6013  (g) or (h) is in effect for 1977. During 1977, H earned $10,000 from the  performance of personal services as an employee. H also received $500 in  dividend income from stock which under the community property laws of  country Z is considered to be the separate property of H. W had no  separate income for 1977. Under the community property laws of country Z  all income earned by either spouse is considered to be community income,  and one-half of this income is considered to belong to the other spouse.  In addition, the laws of country Z provide that all income derived from  property held separately by either spouse is to be treated as community  income and treated as belonging one-half to each spouse. Thus, under the  community property laws of country Z, H and W are both considered to  have realized income of $5,250 during 1977, even though Z's laws  recognize the stock as the separate property of H. Under the rules of  paragraph (a) (2) and (5) of this section all of the income of $10,500  derived during 1977 is treated, for U.S. income tax purposes, as the  income of H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> (3) and (4) of this section all $15,000 of the income is  treated as the income of H for U.S. income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If W exercises substantially all of the management and control  over the retail merchandising company, then for U.S. income tax purposes  the $10,000 profit is treated as the income of W.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that H  also received $1,000 in dividends on stock held separately in his name.  Under the community property laws of country Z the stock is considered  to be community property, the dividends to be community income, and one- half of the income to be the income of each spouse. Under the rule of  paragraph (a)(6) of this section, $500 of the dividend income is  treated, for U.S. income tax purposes, as the income of each spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions and other special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Spouses with different  taxable years. A special rule applies if the nonresident alien and the  United States citizen or resident spouse of the alien do not have the  same taxable years, as defined in section 441(b) and the regulations  thereunder. The special rule is as follows. With respect to the U.S.  citizen or resident spouse, section 879 and this section shall apply to  each taxable year of the U.S. citizen or resident spouse for which no  election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is in effect. With respect to the  nonresident alien spouse, section 879 and this section apply to each  period falling within the consecutive taxable years of the nonresident  alien spouse which coincides with a taxable year of the U.S. citizen or  resident spouse to which section 879 and this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of marital status. For purposes of this section,  marital status shall be determined under section 143(a).  [T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6928, Jan. 31, 1980]</p><p class="depth0">foreign corporations</p>
