level by the electrical installation requirements of Secs. 1910.303 through 1910.308.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Employees in occupations listed in Table S-4 face such a risk and are required to be trained. Other employees who also may reasonably be expected to face a comparable risk of injury due to electric shock or other electrical hazards must also be trained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of training-(1) Practices addressed in this standard. Employees shall be trained in and familiar with the safety-related work practices required by Secs. 1910.331 through 1910.335 that pertain to their respective job assignments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Practices addressed in this standard.
