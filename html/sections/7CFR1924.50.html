Exhibit B to Subpart A of Part 1924--Requirements for Modular/</p><p class="depth0">Panelized Housing Units</p><p class="depth0">For the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 this exhibit prescribes evaluation, acceptance, inspection and  certification procedures formodular/panelized housing units proposed for  use in Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 Rural Housing programs. It applies to proposed  development packages provided either under a contract between an FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 borrower and a single  contractor or under a conditional commitment. This exhibit also  describes the use of background information available through the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for analysis of  manufactured products. This exhibit also applies to the evaluation of  manufactured farm service buildings in paragraph XI, below. For the  purpose of this exhibit, County Supervisor and County Office also mean  District Director and District Office, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">I. Applicable Standards and Manuals.</p><p class="depth0">A. The HUD Handbook 4950.1, Technical Suitability of Products  Program Technical and Processing Procedures, must be followed by housing  manufacturers to obtain acceptance of their products. Acceptance  documents issued by HUD include: Structural Engineering Bulletins (SEB)  on a national basis, Area Letters of Acceptance (ALA) which when  accepted by all Area HUD Offices in a HUD region will, in essence,  become Regional Letters of Acceptance (RLA), Truss Connector Bulletins  (TCB): and, Mechanical Engineering Bulletins (MEB). These documents as  well as the Use of Material Bulletins (UM) and Materials Release  Bulletins (MR) are addendums to the HUD Minimum Property Standards  (MPS), Under handbook guidelines, HUD also examines state agency  regulations concerning design, construction and labeling of modular/ panelized housing units and designates those states having procedures  acceptable for use under HUD programs. Modular/panelized housing  produced in these states is called Category III and is considered  technically suitable for use without further structural analysis.</p><p class="depth0">B. All State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Offices should maintain a close working relationship with each HUD  office in their jurisdiction to assure coordination. Any deviations in  structure, materials or design from HUD acceptance documents must comply  with one of the other applicable development standards.</p><p class="depth0">II. Modular Housing Units that Require Factory Inspections.</p><p class="depth0">Only those types which cannot be completely inspected on site are  required to obtain acceptance from HUD. Those that receive acceptance  will be periodically factory inspected by HUD or HUD's designated  agency, usually about every 6 months.</p><p class="depth0">III. Panelized Housing Units that Do Not Require Factory  Inspections.</p><p class="depth0">A. Housing completely assembled on the building site does not  require HUD acceptance. This includes housing that is manufactured but  is assembled on the site such as: Precut pieces, log wall houses,  trussed roof rafters or floor trusses; open panel walls, and other types  that can be completely inspected on site.</p><p class="depth0">B. Housing that is assembled in local materials dealers' yards for  moving to local sites and to be purchased by an FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant, will be inspected during  construction in the yard by the local FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 County representative. These units must be  constructed according to the applicable development standard and not  transported out of the local FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 County Office jurisdiction. The inspection must be recorded  on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12,  ``Inspection Report.''</p><p class="depth0">IV. Manufacturer's Actions Required for Submissions to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are listed in attachment 1 to  this exhibit B.</p><p class="depth0">V. State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  Office Actions when Manufacturing Facilities are in its Jurisdiction.  The State Office, upon receipt of manufacturer's submission, must:</p><p class="depth0">A. Determine that the unit structural system has been accepted by  HUD as appropriate under HUD Handbook 4950.1 requirements.</p><p class="depth0">B. Review the thermal characteristics and approach of the  calculations to determine actions to be taken in compliance with  paragraph IV C of exhibit D of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">C. Review the proposal for compliance with Sec. 1924.5(d)(1) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0">D. Determine that the prerequisites for consideration of acceptance  by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are met. The  prerequisites include all of the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. A current acceptance document from HUD (SEB, RLA, ALA), except  for Category III housing (modular/panelized housing that does not have  to have a Structural Engineering Bulletin as designated by HUD). In  Category III states, the state government requirements for manufactured  housing must be followed.</p><p class="depth0">2. A current HUD Factory Inspection Report, Form No. 2051m, or in  the case of Category III housing, a copy of the inspection report from  the state government or accepted third party performing the factory  inspection. Each report must be made by HUD or a HUD authorized agency,  and must be no older than 6 months.</p><p class="depth0">3. A letter from the manufacturer requesting a review for  acceptance. Enclosed with the letter shall be all the information listed  in attachment 1 to this exhibit B.</p><p class="depth0">E. Issue acceptance letters to the manufacturer stating the  conditions of acceptance in the format of attachment 2 to this exhibit  B. The letter shall have an attachment listing all models accepted in  the format of attachment 3 to this exhibit B. A copy of the acceptance  letter and list of models shall be sent to each County Office in the  state and, when requested by the manufacturer, to each other FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office in which the  product is to be marketed.</p><p class="depth0">F. After initial review of a submission, maintain a master file of  accepted manufacturers and models and review the file twice yearly to  determine the currency of the factory inspection reports and HUD or  state government acceptance documents.</p><p class="depth0">G. Notify manufacturers of overdue factory inspection reports, for  acceptance of documents review and updating, using the format of  attachment 4 to this exhibit B. Accompanying the notification will be a  temporary acceptance sheet (Attachment 3 to this exhibit B) indicating  to the manufacturer that the company models have temporary acceptance  for 60 days. If the manufacturer provides evidence that a review is  being processed by HUD, a maximum of an additional 90 days may be  granted. Otherwise, the acceptance shall terminate on the last extension  date and it will be necessary for the manufacturer to resubmit as if for  initial acceptance.</p><p class="depth0">H. Distribute a list of added models, deleted models, or notice of  deletion of any manufacturer's product to the County Offices and other  State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Offices as  necessary.</p><p class="depth0">I. Issue an initial supply of Manufacturer's and Builder's  Certification forms (Attachment 5 to this exhibit B) to each existing  and newly accepted manufacturer. Manufacturers are to duplicate this  form as necessary in their market areas.</p><p class="depth0">J. Resolve any problems with the manufacturer, as reported by the  County Office.

Require site plan drawing such as those illustrated in  attachments 1 and 2 to exhibit C of this subpart (available in any FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth0">4. Inspect and identify the model delivered against the  manufacturer's certification and the accepted drawings and description  of materials before the unit has been set on the foundation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Require the builder/dealer to certify that the work for which the  builder/dealer is responsible has been erected in compliance with the  applicable development standard. This certification will be completed on  a copy of attachment 5 to this exhibit B, and filed in County Office  case file.</p><p class="depth0">6. Observe any noncompliance with the applicable development  standard or with paragraphs IV and V of this exhibit B. In this respect:</p><p class="depth0">a. Minor noncompliance will be resolved by the manufacturer through  the builder/dealer. In cases where there is no builder/dealer, the  County Office may resolve such issues with the manufacturer directly.</p><p class="depth0">b. Noncompliance that cannot be resolved at the County Office level  will be reported to the State Office.</p><p class="depth0">7. Inspect manufactured housing according to Sec. 1924.8(d) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0">8. Be aware that the accepted list may include many models from  which loan applicants may choose. No changes from accepted model designs  are permitted. The model selected by an applicant should be appropriate  to the needs of that particular family in accordance with 7 CFR part  3550.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Noncompliance Issues.</p><p class="depth0">A. When minor issues are noted, the County Office will attempt to  resolve them as described above. If they cannot be resolved locally,  they will be referred to the State Office. When any issues cannot be  resolved at State Office level, the National Office Program Support  Staff (PSS) will be contacted for guidance.</p><p class="depth0">B. The National Office PSS coordinating with HUD, will take the  appropriate actions to resolve the issues reported.</p><p class="depth0">C. Manufacturers and builder/dealers must be aware that if the FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 inspector finds any of  the following conditions, the inspector may refuse to accept the  construction until corrections have been made:</p><p class="depth0">1. Evidence of noncompliance with any option of the method described  in the HUD--SEB, RLA, or ALA.</p><p class="depth0">2. Faulty shop fabrication, including surface defects.</p><p class="depth0">3. Damage to shop fabricated items or materials due to  transportation, improper storage, handling or assembly operation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unsatisfactory field or site workmanship.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Actions by Other State Offices. When a State Office receives a  copy of the accepted list from the State Office in which a manufacturing  plant is located, it will:</p><p class="depth0">A. Maintain a file, by manufacturer, of each accepted list of  models.</p><p class="depth0">B. Provide copies of the accepted list of models to each County  Office in the State.</p><p class="depth0">C. Request a copy of the drawings, description of materials, and  thermal calculations to determine compliance with the thermal  requirements for the county in which the house is to be located  according to exhibit D of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">D. Check to see that County Offices within the state will act as  prescribed in paragraph VI of this exhibit B.</p><p class="depth0">E. When two or more State Offices have different interpretations of  the acceptability of a particular model, there must be an agreement  between the states so that they will have the same requirements. If the  states cannot agree, the National Office PSS will be consulted for  guidance.</p><p class="depth0">IX. Subsequent Review.</p><p class="depth0">FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will make  periodic reviews of houses, both site-built and houses manufactured  offsite, to determine acceptability of the finished product. If, in the  judgment of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354,  the product has failed to perform satisfactorily, acceptance may be  withdrawn. The State Director will notify the manufacturer and/or the  builder/dealer of the reasons for the withdrawal no later than the time  of withdrawal. Negotiations for corrections will be carried out by the  County Office with the assistance of the State Office or National  Office, as necessary.</p><p class="depth0">X. Materials and Products Acceptance--Material Release Bulletins,  Use of Materials Bulletins, Manufacturer's Instructions.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Materials Release (MR) and Use of Materials Bulletins (UM)  provide for the national acceptance of specific nonstandard materials  and products not covered in the current HUD MPS.</p><p class="depth0">B. When contractors or builders intend to use products or materials  not listed as approved in the MPS, the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 personnel reviewing or concerned with the  approval of construction in which the product is to be used, will  require the contractor or   builder to furnish a Materials Release Bulletin or Use of Materials  Bulletin on the materials or products. If the product has been accepted,  the supplier should be able to obtain the bulletin for the contractor or  builder from the manufacturer. These bulletins describe the products or  materials limitations to use, method of installing or applying, approved  type of fasteners, if used, etc. and will provide the contractor with  instructions as to proper installation or application.</p><p class="depth0">C. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  personnel are unfamiliar with any materials or products which have been  accepted in the MPS, they will request the contractor or builder to  furnish the manufacturer's instructions to assure that the materials or  products are properly installed or applied. Any questions on any product  that cannot be resolved in the County Office should be referred to the  State Office. When the question cannot be resolved at the State Office  level, the National Office PSS should be consulted for guidance.</p><p class="depth0">XI. Manufactured Farm Service Buildings.</p><p class="depth0">A. When a loan application is received that involves a manufactured  building or special equipment that cannot be completely inspected on the  site, the local State Land Grant University recommendations should be  requested.</p><p class="depth0">B. When the County Office questions the advisability of making a  loan on a manufactured building, the State Office should also be  consulted.</p><p class="depth0">C. The State Office should review and make recommendations to the  County Office. If doubt still exists, the National Office PSS should be  consulted for guidance.</p><p class="depth0">Attachment 1--Required Information for Acceptance of Modular/Panelized</p><p class="depth0">Housing Units</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer or sponsor of modular/panelized housing units  wishing to participate in the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Rural Housing programs shall  submit to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  State Director having jurisdiction over the state in which the proposed  housing is to be manufactured, two complete sets of the information  listed below for evaluation.

Exhibit D to Subpart A of Part 1924--Thermal Performance</p><p class="depth0">Construction Standards</p><p class="depth0">I. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">This exhibit prescribes thermal performance construction standards  to be used in all housing loan and grant programs. These requirements  shall supersede the thermal performance requirements in any of the  development standards in Sec. 1924.4(h) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">II. Policy</p><p class="depth0">All loan or grant applications involving new construction (except  for new Single Family Housing (SFH)) and all applications for  conditional commitments (except for new SFH) shall have drawings and  specifications prepared to comply with paragraphs IV A or C and IV D of  this exhibit. All new SFH construction shall have drawing and  specifications prepared to comply with paragraph IV F of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">III. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">A. British thermal unit (Btu) means the quantity of heat required to  raise the temperature of one pound (.4535 Kg.) of water by one degree  Fahrenheit (F). For example, one Btu is the amount of heat needed to  raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59 degrees F to 60  degrees F.</p><p class="depth0">B. Glazing is the material set into a sash or door when used as a  natural light source and/or for occupant's views of the outdoors.</p><p class="depth0">C. ``R'' value, thermal resistence, is a unit of measure of the  ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R value, the higher the  insulating ability.</p><p class="depth0">D. ``U'' value is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and  is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building  section. U is the reciprocal of R. Thus U=1/R or R=1/U or 1/C where C is  the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat  flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a  temperature of one degree Fahrenheit. The lower the U value, the higher  the insulating ability.</p><p class="depth0">E. Winter degree-day is a unit based on temperature difference and  time. For any one day, when the mean temperature is less than 65 degrees  F (18.3 degrees Celsius), there are as many degree-days as the number of  degrees difference between the mean temperature for the day and 65  degrees F. The daily mean temperature is computed as half the total of  the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">F. CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 Edition (MEC-92)--This code sets  forth the minimum energy/thermal requirements for the design of new  buildings and structures or portions thereof and additions to existing  buildings. The MEC is maintained by the Council of American Building  Officials (CABO).</p><p class="depth0">IV. Minimum Requirements</p><p class="depth0">A.

Raised trusses are not</p><p class="depth0">required. \3\ For floors of heated spaces over unheated basements, unheated garages or unheated crawl spaces, the U value</p><p class="depth0">of floor section shall not exceed the value shown. A basement, crawl space, or garage shall be considered</p><p class="depth0">unheated unless it is provided with a positive heat supply to maintain a minimum temperature of 50 degrees F.</p><p class="depth0">Positive heat supply is defined by ASHRAE as ``heat supplied to a space by design or by heat losses occurring</p><p class="depth0">from energy-consuming systems or components associated with that space.'' Where the walls of an unheated basement or crawl space are insulated in lieu of floor insulation, the total heat</p><p class="depth0">loss attributed to the floor from the heated area shall not exceed the heat loss calculated for floors with</p><p class="depth0">required insulation.</p><p class="depth0">Insulation may be omitted from floors over heated basement areas or heated crawl spaces if foundation walls are</p><p class="depth0">insulated.

Summary</p><p class="depth0">Section 401 of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act as  amended by the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion  Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-317, provides a requirement that each federal  agency issue regulations and to take such other steps necessary to  prohibit the use of lead-based paint on all applicable surfaces in  Federal and Federally-assisted construction or rehabilitation of  residential structures. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act,  Pub. L. 91-695, January 13, 1971, provides for grants to units of  general local government in any state for the purpose of detecting and  treating incidents of lead-based paint poisoning. Title II of this Act  also provides for grants to the same units to identify those areas of  risk including testing to detect the presence of lead-based paint on  surfaces of residential housing.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Purpose and Scope. This exhibit describes and identifies  acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and  concepts for manufactured homes. It is intended for FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field personnel, builders,  developers, sponsors, and others participating in FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 housing programs.</p><p class="depth0">This exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those  referenced in exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental  projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and  construction of manufactured home communities. FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 may approve alternatives or substitutes  if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and  if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work  is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this exhibit considering  quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of  life and health.</p><p class="depth0">FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will require  satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made  regarding the use of any proposed alternative.</p><p class="depth0">II. Background. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 has authority to make (1) section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with  respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) section 515 Rural Rental  Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.</p><p class="depth0">The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the  Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and  be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets  or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-Family  Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354. The manufactured home must be  permanently attached to that   foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified  in the MPS. This includes resistance to ground movements, seismic  shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by  wind. Note that anchoring straps or cables affixed to ground anchors  other than footings will not meet these requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter applies on scattered sites,  in subdivisions and rental projects to the development, installation and  set-up of manufactured homes. To determine the level of environmental  analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home  or lot involved shall be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or  lot as these terms are used in Sec. Sec. 1940.310-1940.312 as well as in  any other sections of subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter. The  implementation of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  environmental policies and the consideration of important land use  impacts are of particular relevance in the review of proposed  manufactured home sites and in achieving the two purposes highlighted  below. Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured  home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and  subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and  subdivision development, two of the purposes of this exhibit are to:</p><p class="depth0">A. Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities  and nearby areas, and</p><p class="depth0">B. Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.</p><p class="depth0">Therefore, this exhibit identifies those required standards and  regulations and suggested guidelines for eliminating and preventing  health and safety hazards and promoting the economical and orderly  development and utilization of land for planning and development of  manufactured home communities. The exhibit also provides the  requirements for meeting the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Resistance to Wind. Foundations and anchorages shall be designed  to resist wind forces specified in American National Standards Institute  (ANSI) A-58.1-1982 for the geographic area in which the manufactured  home will be sited;</p><p class="depth0">B. Proper Installation. The manufacturer's installation instructions  provided with each manufactured home shall contain instructions for at  least one site-built foundation with interior and/or perimeter supports.  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field office  personnel shall review to determine its adequacy as security for an FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan only, the  foundation design concept for compliance with this exhibit, the FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354/MPS and any Model Building  Code acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  in that particular geographic area; and</p><p class="depth0">C. Proper Foundation Design. Manufactured homes shall be installed  on a foundation system which is designed and constructed to sustain,  within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable  loads. Any foundation and anchorage system or method of construction to  be used should be analyzed in accordance with well-established  principles of mechanics and structural engineering.</p><p class="depth0">III. Definitions. For the purpose of this exhibit the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">Accessory Building or Structure.</p><p class="depth0">A subordinate building or structure which is an addition to or  supplements the facilities provided by a manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">Anchoring Systems. An approved system for securing the manufactured  home to the ground or foundation system that will, when properly  designed and installed, resist overturning and lateral movement of the  home from wind forces.</p><p class="depth0">Contiguous. Sharing a boundary, adjoining or adjacent. A lot or  subdivision is considered to be contiguous to other lots or subdivisions  if it is adjoining, touching or adjacent.</p><p class="depth0">Federal manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards  (FMHCSS). A 1976 federal standard, commonly known as the HUD Standard,  for the construction, design and performance of a manufactured home  which meets the needs of the public including the need for quality,  durability and safety. Units conforming to the FMHCSS are certified by  an affixed label that reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0">AS EVIDENCED BY THIS LABEL NO. -------- THE MANUFACTURER CERTIFIES  TO THE BEST OF THE MANUFACTURER'S KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF THAT THIS  MANUFACTURED HOME HAS BEEN INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS  OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND IS CONSTRUCTED IN  CONFORMANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY  STANDARDS IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE.

Subpart E of part 1944, ``Rural Rental Housing Loan Policies,  Procedures, and Authorizations.''</p><p class="depth0">The requirements of the above references have not been repeated in  this exhibit. Those requirements contained above are either mandatory or  minimums and every effort should be made by the applicant, builder- developer or dealer-contractor to utilize higher standards, when  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Part B--Construction and Land Development</p><p class="depth0">I. General Acceptability Criteria. The following criteria apply to  development on scattered sites, in subdivisions and in rental project  communities.</p><p class="depth0">A. A manufactured home development including a site, rental project  or subdivision shall be located on property designated for that use,  where designations exist, by the local jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Conditions of soil, ground water level, drainage, flooding and  topography shall not   create hazards to the property and health or safety of the residents.</p><p class="depth0">C. The finished grade elevation beneath the manufactured home or the  first flood elevation of the habitable space, whichever is lower, shall  be above the 100-year return frequency flood elevation. This requirement  applies wherever manufactured homes may be installed, not just in  locations designated by the National Flood Insurance Program as areas of  special flood hazards. The use of fill to accomplish this is a last  resort. However, as stated in Sec. 1940.304 of subpart G of part 1940 of  this chapter, it is FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354's policy not to approve or fund any proposal in a 100-year  floodplain area unless there is no practicable alternative to such a  floodplain location.</p><p class="depth0">D. Essential service such as employment centers, shopping, schools,  recreation areas, police and fire protection, and garbage and trash  removal shall be convenient to the development and any site, community,  or subdivision must meet the environmental and location requirements  contained in subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">E. Manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall  not be subject to any adverse influences of adjacent land uses. An  adverse influence is considered as one that is out of the acceptable  level or range of a recognizable standard or where no standard exists is  considered a nuisance irrespective of a site being zoned for  manufactured home use.

General. The following policies will govern the inspection of all  manufactured housing development work. This includes scattered sites,  subdivisions, rental housing projects and all accessory structures and  related facilities unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">II. Inspections. A. The responsibility for frequency and propose of  inspections shall be in accordance with Sec. 1924.9(b) (1), (2) and (3)  of this subpart. The inspection requirements of Sec. 1924.13 apply to  the planning and conduct of construction work on all 515 housing  developments that are more extensive in scope and more complex in nature  than those involving an individual manufactured housing unit. The Stage  2 inspection customary for site-built housing when the building is  enclosed is not required for manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth0">The Stage 2 inspection for manufactured homes will be made within  two working days after erection or placement on the foundation to  determine compliance with accepted installation drawings and  specifications for installation and set-up and to verify that the  correct unit is on the site.</p><p class="depth0">Stages 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined  when authorized by the State Director.</p><p class="depth0">B. The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District  Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always  for the final inspection.</p><p class="depth0">C. The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits  to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work  in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or  otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or  nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give  prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the  notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.</p><p class="depth0">D. During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine  whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and  stiffened during transportation. Inspectors should examine these units  to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings  that may have occurred during transportation. The dealer-contractor must  warrant these units against such damage, which should protect FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's interest.</p><p class="depth0">III. Warranty Plan Coverage. The warranty requirements for all  development work shall be in accordance with Sec. 1924.9(d) of this  subpart and 7 CFR part 3550, subpart B.  [51 FR 41603, Nov. 18, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 19283, May 22, 1987; 53  FR 2156, Jan. 26, 1988; 67 FR 78327, Dec. 24, 2002]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit K to Subpart A of Part 1924--Classifications for Multi-</p><p class="depth0">Family Residential Rehabilitation Work</p><p class="depth0">I. General</p><p class="depth0">This exhibit distinguishes between what FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 considers maintenance and repair work, moderate  rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitation. In all cases, the  building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound. The  applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made  to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed  rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth0">II.

Sec. Exhibit L to Subpart A of Part 1924--Insured 10-Year Home Warranty</p><p class="depth0">Plan Requirements</p><p class="depth0">I. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">In recent years, numerous third-party home warranty plans have been  developed offering new homeowners varying degrees of protection against  builder default and/or major structural defects in their homes. This  exhibit establishes the criteria and procedures by which a warranty plan  is found acceptable for new construction of single family homes financed  by Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354. An acceptable warranty plan will:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assure that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  borrowers receive adequate warranty coverage,</p><p class="depth0">B. In certain circumstances, eliminate the requirement for FmHA or  its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel to make the  first two construction inspections, and</p><p class="depth0">C. Permit a loan up to the market value of the security (less the  unpaid principal balance and past due interest of any other liens  against the security), even though FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 personnel may not have performed period inspections  during construction.</p><p class="depth0">II. Types of Warranty Companies</p><p class="depth0">A. An insured warranty company is underwritten by an insurance  carrier, licensed to operate as an insurer by the states where the  warranty company plans to operate, and has an acceptable rating from a  nationally recognized rating company such as A.M. Best Company.</p><p class="depth0">B. A risk retention group is an insurer which is licensed in one  state and is authorized, under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act  of 1981, to issue its policies in all states. This authority is not  challenged by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354;  however, there remains some question as to the legal propriety of a 10- year insured warranty insurer to be a risk-retention group.
