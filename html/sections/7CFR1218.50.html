                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At least 60 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, and as may be necessary thereafter, the Council shall prepare and submit to the Secretary a budget for the fiscal year covering its anticipated expenses and disbursements in administering this subpart. Each such budget shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of objectives and strategy for each program, plan, or project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A summary of anticipated revenue, with comparative data or at least one preceding year (except for the initial budget);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A summary of proposed expenditures for each program, plan, or project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Staff and administrative expense breakdowns, with comparative data for at least on preceding year (except for the initial budget).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each budget shall provide adequate funds to defray its proposed expenditures and to provide for a reserve as set forth in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to this section, any amendment or addition to an approved budget must be approved by the Secretary, including shifting funds from one program, plan, or project to another. Shifts of funds which do not

cause an increase in the Council's approved budget and which are consistent with governing bylaws need not have prior approval by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Council is authorized to incur such expenses, including provision for a reasonable reserve, as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Council for its maintenance and functioning, and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Such expenses shall be paid from funds received by the Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> With approval of the Secretary, the Council may borrow money for the payment of administrative expenses, subject to the same fiscal, budget, and audit controls as other funds of the Council. Any funds borrowed by the Council shall be expended only for startup costs and capital outlays and are limited to the first year of operation of the Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Council may accept voluntary contributions, but these shall only be used to pay expenses incurred in the conduct of programs, plans, and projects. Such contributions shall be free from any encumbrance by the donor and the Council shall retain complete control of their use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Council may also receive funds provided through the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service or from other sources, with the approval of the Secretary, for authorized activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Council shall reimburse the Secretary for all expenses incurred by the Secretary in the implementation, administration, and supervision of the Order, including all referendum costs in connection with the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The Council may not expend for administration, maintenance, and functioning of the Council in any fiscal year an amount that exceeds 15 percent of the assessments and other income received by the Council for that fiscal year. Reimbursements to the Secretary required under paragraph (h) are excluded from this limitation on spending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The Council may establish an operating monetary reserve and may carry over to subsequent fiscal periods excess funds in any reserve so established: Provided that the funds in the reserve do not exceed one fiscal period's budget. Subject to approval by the Secretary, such reserve funds may be used to defray any expenses authorized under this part.
