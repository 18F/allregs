                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voice modulated communication equipment. A curve or equivalent data showing the frequency response of the audio modulating circuit over a range of 100 to 5000 Hz shall be submitted. For equipment required to have an audio low-pass filter, a curve showing the frequency response of the filter, or of all

circuitry installed between the modulation limiter and the modulated stage shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equipment which employs modulation limiting. A curve or family of curves showing the percentage of modulation versus the modulation input voltage shall be supplied. The information submitted shall be sufficient to show modulation limiting capability throughout the range of modulating frequencies and input modulating signal levels employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Single sideband and independent sideband radiotelephone transmitters which employ a device or circuit to limit peak envelope power. A curve showing the peak envelope power output versus the modulation input voltage shall be supplied. The modulating signals shall be the same in frequency as specified in paragraph (c) of Sec. 2.1049 for the occupied bandwidth tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other types of equipment. A curve or equivalent data which shows that the equipment will meet the modulation requirements of the rules under which the equipment is to be licensed.
