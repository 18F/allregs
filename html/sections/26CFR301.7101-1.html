For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a bond shall be considered executed with satisfactory surety if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is executed by a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is secured by bonds or notes of the United States as provided in 6 U.S.C. 15 (see 31 CFR part 225).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other surety acceptable in discretion of district director.
