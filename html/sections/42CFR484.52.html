                            <p class="depth0">The HHA has written policies requiring an overall evaluation of the  agency's total program at least once a year by the group of professional  personnel (or a committee of this group), HHA staff, and consumers, or  by professional people outside the agency working in conjunction with  consumers. The evaluation consists of an overall policy and  administrative review and a clinical record review. The evaluation  assesses the extent to which the agency's program is appropriate,  adequate, effective, and efficient. Results of the evaluation are  reported to and acted upon by those responsible for the operation of the  agency and are maintained separately as administrative records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard: Policy and administrative review. As a part of the  evaluation process the policies and administrative practices of the  agency are reviewed to determine the extent to which they promote  patient care that is appropriate, adequate, effective, and efficient.  Mechanisms are established in writing for the collection of pertinent  data to assist in evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard: Clinical record review. At least quarterly,  appropriate health professionals, representing at least the scope of the  program, review a sample of both active and closed clinical records to  determine whether established policies are followed in furnishing  services directly or under arrangement. There is a continuing review of  clinical records for each 60-day period that a patient receives home  health services to determine adequacy of the plan of care and  appropriateness of continuation of care.
