                                Sec. 24.305  Fixed payment for moving expenses--nonresidential moves.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Business. A displaced business may be eligible to choose a fixed  payment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses,  and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by Sec. Sec.  24.301, 24.303 and 24.304. Such fixed payment, except for payment to a  nonprofit organization, shall equal the average annual net earnings of  the business, as computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this  section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. The displaced  business is eligible for the payment if the Agency determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved  in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be  incurred in such move and, the business vacates or relocates from its  displacement site;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of  its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is  assumed to meet this test unless the Agency determines that it will not  suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more  than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Agency,  and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or  similar business activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely  for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The business is not operated at the displacement site solely for  the purpose of renting the site to others; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The business contributed materially to the income of the  displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement. (See  Sec. 24.2(a)(7).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining the number of businesses. In determining whether two  or more displaced legal entities constitute a single business, which is  entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be  considered, including the extent to which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The same premises and equipment are shared;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are  carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The entities are held out to the public, and to those  customarily dealing with them, as one business; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The same person or closely related persons own, control, or  manage the affairs of the entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Farm operation. A displaced farm operation (defined at Sec.  24.2(a)(12)) may choose a fixed payment, in lieu of the payments for  actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment  expenses, in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as  computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, but not less  than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. In the case of a partial acquisition  of land, which was a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed  payment shall be made only if the Agency determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be  displaced from the farm operation on the remaining land; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the  nature of the farm operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d).)</em></p><p class="depth1"><em>(e).)</em></p>
