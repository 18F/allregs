                            <p class="depth0">The Board shall thereupon proceed, upon the petition, responses, and  submission of briefs, to determine whether, on the facts before it, the  commerce operations of the employer involved are such that it would or  would not assert jurisdiction over them. Such determination shall be  made by a declaratory order, with like effect as in the case of other  orders of the Board, and shall be served upon the parties. Any party  desiring to file a brief shall file eight copies with the Board in  Washington, DC, with a statement that copies thereof are being served  simultaneously on the other parties.
