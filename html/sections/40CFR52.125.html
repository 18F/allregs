                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the control strategy does not analyze the impact of smelter fugitive emissions on ambient air quality (except at Hayden, Arizona) in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate, and the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions. Arizona must submit these smelter fugitive emissions control strategies to EPA by August 1, 1984. In addition, the requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not require permanent control of fugitive smelter emissions necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides. The control strategy for Hayden shows that these controls are required to attain and maintain the national standards, and the fugitive control strategy analyses required above may show that they are required for some or all of the other smelter towns in Arizona. Arizona must submit all fugitive emissions control regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides to EPA by August 1, 1984. Therefore, the control strategies and regulations for the six smelter areas in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate and the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions are incomplete due to Arizona's failure to address the fugitive emissions problems at copper smelters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the control strategy does not analyze the impact of smelter fugitive emissions on ambient air quality (except at Hayden, Arizona) in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate, and the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions.
