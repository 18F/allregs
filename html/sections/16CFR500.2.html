                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part, unless the context otherwise specifically  requires:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term Act means the ``Fair Packaging and Labeling Act'' (Pub.  L. 89-755, approved Nov. 3, 1966; 80 Stat. 1296 et seq.; 15 U.S.C. 1451  et seq., as amended by Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term regulation or regulations means regulations promulgated  by the Commission pursuant to sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Act (15 U.S.C.  1453, 1454, 1455).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term consumer commodity or commodity means any article,  product, or commodity of any kind or class which is customarily produced  or distributed for sale through retail sales agencies or  instrumentalities for consumption by individuals, or use by individuals  for purposes of personal care or in the performance of services  ordinarily rendered within the household, and which usually is consumed  or expended in the course of such consumption or use. For purposes of  the regulations in this part the term consumer commodity does not  include any food, drug, device or cosmetic as defined by section 201 of  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321); any meat or  meat product, poultry or poultry product, or tobacco or tobacco product;  any commodity subject to packaging or labeling requirements imposed by  the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the  Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et  seq.); any commodity subject to   the provisions of the eighth paragraph under the heading ``Bureau of  Animal Industry'' of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151-157); any  beverage subject to or complying with packaging or labeling requirements  imposed under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 201 et  seq.); any commodity subject to the provisions of the Federal Seed Act  (7 U.S.C. 1551-1610).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term package means any container or wrapping in which any  consumer commodity is enclosed for use in the delivery or display of  that commodity to retail purchasers. For purposes of the regulations in  this part the term package does not include shipping containers or  wrappings used solely for the transportation of any consumer commodity  in bulk or in quantity to manufacturers, packers, or processors, or to  wholesale or retail distributors thereof unless used in retail display;  shipping containers or outer wrappings used by retailers to ship or  deliver any commodity to retail customers if such containers and  wrappings bear no printed matter pertaining to any particular commodity;  or containers subject to the provisions of the Act of August 3, 1912 (37  Stat. 250, as amended; 15 U.S.C. 231-233), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38  Stat. 1186, as amended; 15 U.S.C. 234-236); or transparent wrappers or  containers which do not bear written, printed, or graphic matter  obscuring any part of the label information required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term label means any written, printed, or graphic matter  affixed to or appearing upon any consumer commodity or affixed to or  appearing upon a package containing any consumer commodity; except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An inspector's tag or other nonpromotional matter affixed to or  appearing upon a consumer commodity shall not be deemed to be a label  requiring the repetition of label information required by this part, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of the regulations in this part the term label  does not include written, printed, or graphic matter affixed to or  appearing upon commodities, or affixed to or appearing upon containers  or wrappers for commodities sold or distributed to industrial or  institutional users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term person includes any firm, corporation or associations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term commerce means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commerce between any State, the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the  United States, and any place outside thereof, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commerce within the District of Columbia or within any territory  or possession of the United States, not organized with a legislature,  but shall not include exports to foreign countries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term principal display panel means that part of a label that  is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under  normal and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The  principal display panel must be large enough to accommodate all the  mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part  without obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding. This definition does  not preclude utilization of alternate principal display panels on a  label of a package, but alternate principal display panels must  duplicate the information required to be placed on the principal display  panel by this part. This definition does not preclude utilization of the  container closure as the surface bearing the principal display panel if  that label location is the one most likely to be displayed, presented,  shown, or examined under normal and customary conditions of display for  retail sale. The principal display panel of a label appearing on a  cylindrical surface is that 40 percent of the circumference which is  more likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal  and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal  display panel of a consumer commodity marketed in a decorative type  container, or a container having a capacity of \1/4\ ounce (7.4 mL) or  less, may be considered to be a tear-away tag or tape affixed to the  container and bearing the mandatory label information as required by  this part, but the type size of the net quantity of contents statement  shall be governed by the dimensions of the container itself.   The principal display panel of a consumer commodity marketed on a  display card to which the immediate container of the commodity is  affixed may be considered to be the display panel of the card, and the  type size of the net quantity of contents statement is governed by the  dimensions of the display card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The term random package means a package which is one of a lot,  shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with  varying weights, that is, packages with no fixed weight pattern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The term SI metric refers to units belonging to the  International System of Units (abbreviated ``SI'' from the French, Le  Systeme International d'Unites), as interpreted or modified for use in  the United States by the Secretary of Commerce. They include the SI  units (together with their multiples and submultiples) as well as other  metric units (e.g., the liter) that are accepted for use with the SI  units because of their practical importance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term customary inch/pound refers to units belonging to the  system of units used in the United States based on or derived from the  ounce, pound, and ton for weight; the inch, foot, yard, and mile for  length; the fluid ounce, pint, quart, and gallon for volume; and dry  pint, dry quart, peck, and bushel for dry measure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The term ``e'' mark refers to the symbol ``e'' used in  connection with the quantity declarations on labels of some consumer  commodities marketed primarily in the European Community (EC). The ``e''  mark constitutes a representation by the packer or importer that the  package to which it is applied has been filled in accordance with the  average system of quantity specified by the EC. The average system is a  method of declaring package fill in the EC and other countries of the  world, including the United States.</p>
