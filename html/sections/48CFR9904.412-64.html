                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To be acceptable, any method of transition from compliance with  Standard 9904.412 in effect prior to March 30, 1995, to compliance with  the Standard effective March 30, 1995, must follow the equitable  principle that costs, which have been previously provided for, shall not  be redundantly provided for under revised methods. Conversely, costs  that have not previously been provided for must be provided for under  the revised method. This transition subsection is not intended to  qualify for purposes of assignment or allocation, pension costs which  have previously been disallowed for reasons other than ERISA tax- deductibility limitations. The sum of all portions of unfunded actuarial  liability identified pursuant to Standard 9904.412, effective March 30,  1995, including such portions   of unfunded actuarial liability determined for transition purposes, is  subject to the provisions of 9904.412-40(c) on requirements for  assignment. The method, or methods, employed to achieve an equitable  transition shall be consistent with the provisions of Standard 9904.412,  effective March 30, 1995, and shall be approved by the contracting  officer. Examples and illustrations of such transition methods include,  but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reassignment of certain prior unfunded accruals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any portion  of pension cost for a qualified defined-benefit pension plan, assigned  to a cost accounting period prior to March 30, 1995, which was not  funded because such cost exceeded the maximum tax-deductible amount,  determined in accordance with ERISA, shall be assigned to subsequent  accounting periods, including an adjustment for interest, as an  assignable cost deficit. However, such costs shall be assigned to  periods on or after March 30, 1995, only to the extent that such costs  have not previously been allocated as cost or price to contracts subject  to this Standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, the transition method described in paragraph (d)  of this subsection may be applied separately to costs subject to  paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reassignment of certain prior unallocated credits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any  portion of pension cost for a defined-benefit pension plan, assigned to  a cost accounting period prior to March 30, 1995, which was not  allocated as a cost or price credit to contracts subject to this  Standard because such cost was less than zero, shall be assigned to  subsequent accounting periods, including an adjustment for interest, as  an assignable cost credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, the transition method described in paragraph (d)  of this subsection may be applied separately to costs subject to  paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accounting for certain prior allocated unfunded accruals. Any  portion of unfunded pension cost for a nonqualified defined-benefit  pension plan, assigned to a cost accounting period prior to March 30,  1995, that was allocated as cost or price to contracts subject to this  Standard, shall be recognized in subsequent accounting periods,  including adjustments for imputed interest and benefit payments, as an  accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> ``Fresh start'' alternative transition method. The transition  methods of paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1), and (c) of this subsection may be  implemented using the so-called ``fresh start'' method whereby a portion  of the unfunded actuarial liability of a defined-benefit pension plan,  which occurs in the first cost accounting period after March 30, 1995,  shall be treated in the same manner as an actuarial gain or loss. Such  portion of unfunded actuarial liability shall exclude any portion of  unfunded actuarial liability that must continue to be separately  identified and maintained in accordance with 9904.412-50(a)(2),  including interest adjustments. If the contracting officer already has  approved a different amortization period for the fresh start  amortization, then such amortization period shall continue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Change to pay-as-you-go method. A change in accounting method  subject to 9903.302 will have occurred whenever costs of a nonqualified  defined-benefit pension plan have been accounted for on an accrual basis  prior to March 30, 1995, and the contractor must change to the pay-as- you-go cost method because the plan does not meet the requirement of  9904.412-50(c)(3), either by election or otherwise. In such case, any  portion of unfunded pension cost, assigned to a cost accounting period  prior to March 30, 1995 that was allocated as cost or price to contracts  subject to this Standard, shall be assigned to future accounting  periods, including adjustments for imputed interest and benefit  payments, as an accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals. Costs  computed under the pay-as-you-go cost method shall be charged against  such accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals before such costs  may be allocated to contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Actuarial assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used to  calculate assignable cost deficits, assignable cost credits, or  accumulated values of permitted unfunded accruals for transition  purposes shall be consistent with   the long term assumptions used for valuation purposes for such prior  periods unless the contracting officer has previously approved the use  of other reasonable assumptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em>  (1) through (9) of this subsection address pension costs and transition  amounts determined for the first cost accounting period beginning on or  after the date this revised Standard becomes applicable to a contractor.  For purposes of these illustrations an interest assumption of 7% is  presumed to be in effect for all periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2), equal the total unfunded  actuarial liability, pension cost may be assigned to the current period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>,  equal the total unfunded actuarial liability, pension cost may be  assigned to the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assume the same facts as in 9904.412-64(g)(1), except Contractor  S only funded and allocated $500,000. The $300,000 of assigned cost that  was not funded, but could have been funded without exceeding the tax- deductible maximum, may not be recognized as an assignable cost deficit.  Instead, the $300,000 must be separately identified and maintained in  accordance with 9904.412-50(a)(2). If the $321,000 ($300,000x1.07) plus  the $214,000 already identified as an assignable cost deficit plus all  other portions of unfunded actuarial liability identified in accordance  with 9904.412-50(a) (1) and (2), equal the total unfunded actuarial  liability, pension cost may be assigned to the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assume that, for Contractor S in 9904.412-64(g)(3), the only  portion of unfunded actuarial liability that must be identified under  9904.412-50(a)(2) is the $321,000. If Contractor S chooses to use the  ``fresh start'' transition method, the $321,000 of unfunded assigned  cost must be subtracted from the total unfunded actuarial liability in  accordance with 9904.412-63(d). The net amount of unfunded actuarial  liability shall then be amortized over a period of fifteen years as an  actuarial loss in accordance with 9904.412-50(a)(1)(v) and Cost  Accounting Standard 9904.413.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For the cost accounting period immediately preceding the date  this revised Standard becomes applicable to a contractor, Contractor T  computed and assigned pension cost of negative $400,000 for a qualified  defined-benefit plan. Because the contractor could not withdraw assets  from the trust fund, the contracting officer agreed that instead of  allocating a current period credit to contracts, the negative costs  would be carried forward, with interest, and offset against future  pension costs allocated to the contract. Using the transition method of  paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection, the contractor shall establish an  assignable cost credit equal to $428,000 ($400,000x1.07). If this  assignable cost credit amount, plus all other portions of unfunded  actuarial liability identified in accordance with 9904.412-50(a) (1) and  (2), equals the total unfunded actuarial liability, pension cost may be  assigned to the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Assume that in 9904.412-64(g)(5), following guidance issued by  the contracting agency the contracting officer   had deemed the cost for the prior period to be $0. In order to satisfy  the requirements of 9904.412-40(c) and assign pension cost to the  current period, Contractor S must account for the prior period negative  accruals that have not been specifically identified. Following the  transition method of paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection, the contractor  shall identify $428,000 as an assignable cost credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Assume the facts of 9904.412-64(g)(5), except Contractor S uses  the ``fresh start'' transition method. In addition, for the current  period the plan is overfunded since the actuarial value of the assets is  greater than the actuarial accrued liability. In this case, an actuarial  gain equal to the negative unfunded actuarial liability; i.e., actuarial  surplus, is recognized since there are no portions of unfunded actuarial  liability that must be identified under 9904.412-50(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Since March 28, 1989 Contractor U has computed, assigned, and  allocated pension costs for a nonqualified defined-benefit plan on an  accrual basis. The value of these past accruals, increased for imputed  interest at 7% and decreased for benefits paid by the contractor, is  equal to $2 million as of the beginning of the current period.  Contractor U elects to establish a ``Rabbi trust'' and the plan meets  the other criteria at 9904.412-50(c)(3). Using the transition method of  paragraph (c) of this subsection, Contractor U shall recognize the $2  million as the accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals, which  will then be included in the market value and actuarial value of the  assets. Because the accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals is  exactly equal to the current period market value of the assets, 100% of  benefits for the current period must be paid from sources other than the  funding agency in accordance with 9904.412-50(d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Assume that Contractor U in 9904.412-64(g)(8) establishes a  funding agency, but elects to use the pay-as-you-go method for current  and future pension costs. Furthermore, plan participants receive  $500,000 in benefits on the last day of the current period. Using the  transition method of paragraph (e) of this subsection to ensure prior  costs are not redundantly provided for, the contractor shall establish  assets; i.e., an accumulated value of permitted unfunded accruals, of $2  million. Since these assets are sufficient to provide for the current  benefit payments, no pension costs can be allocated in this period.  Furthermore, previously priced contracts subject to this Standard shall  be adjusted in accordance with 9903.302. The accumulated value of  permitted unfunded accruals shall be carried forward to the next period  by adding $140,000 (7%x$2 million) of imputed interest, and subtracting  the $500,000 of benefit payments made by the contractor. The accumulated  value of permitted unfunded accruals for the next period equals  $1,640,000 ($2 million + $140,000--$500,000).

During each successive accounting period of Pension Harmonization  Rule Transition Period, the contractor shall recognize on a scheduled  basis the amount by which the minimum actuarial liability differs from  the actuarial accrued liability; and the amount by which the sum of the  minimum normal cost plus any expense load differs from the sum of the  normal cost plus any expense load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of determining the amount of the difference, the  minimum actuarial liability and minimum normal cost shall be measured in  accordance with 9904.412-50(b)(7)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During each successive accounting period of the Pension  Harmonization Rule Transition Period, the transitional minimum actuarial  liability shall be set equal to the actuarial accrued liability adjusted  by an amount equal to the difference between the minimum actuarial  liability and actuarial accrued liability, multiplied by the scheduled  applicable percentage for that period. The sum of the transitional  minimum normal cost plus any expense load shall be set equal to the sum  of normal cost plus any expense load, adjusted by an amount equal to the  difference between the minimum normal cost and the normal cost, plus  expense loads, multiplied by the scheduled applicable percentage for  that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The scheduled applicable percentages for each successive  accounting period of the Pension Harmonization Rule Transition Period  are as follows: 0% for the First Cost Accounting Period, 25% for the  Second Cost Accounting Period, 50% for the Third Cost Accounting Period,  75% for the Fourth Cost Accounting Period, and 100% for the Fifth Cost  Accounting Period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The transitional minimum actuarial liability and transitional  minimum normal cost measured in accordance with this provision shall be  used for purposes of the 9904.412-50(b)(7) minimum actuarial liability  and minimum normal cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The actuarial gain or loss attributable to experience since the  prior valuation, measured as of the First Cost Accounting Period of the  Pension Harmonization Rule Transition Period, shall be amortized over a  ten-year period in accordance with 9904.413-50(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transition Illustration. Assume the same facts for the Harmony  Corporation in Illustration 9904.412-60.1(a) and (b), except that this  is the Fourth Cost Accounting Period of the Pension Harmonization Rule  Transition Period. As in Illustration 9904.412-60.1(a) and (b), the  contractor separately computes pension costs for Segment 1, and computes  pension costs for Segments 2 through 7 in the aggregate. The contractor  has two actuarial valuations prepared: one measures the actuarial  accrued liability and normal cost using the contractor's expected rate  of return on investments assumption, in accordance with 9904.412- 40(b)(2) and 9904.412-50(b)(4), and the other valuation measures the  minimum actuarial liability and minimum normal cost based on the assumed  current yields on investment quality corporate bonds in accordance with  9904.412-50(b)(7)(iii)(A).
