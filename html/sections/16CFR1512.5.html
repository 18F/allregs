                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Braking system. Bicycles shall be equipped with front- and rear- wheel brakes or rear-wheel brakes only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Handbrakes. Handbrakes shall be tested at least ten times by  applying a force sufficient to cause the handlever to contact the  handlebar, or a maximum of 445 N (100 lbf), in accordance with the  loading test, Sec. 1512.18(d)(2), and shall be rocked back and forth  with the weight of a 68.1 kg (150 lb) rider on the seat with the same  handbrake force applied in accordance with the rocking test, Sec.  1512.18(d)(2)(iii); there shall be no visible fractures, failures,  movement of clamps, or misalignment of brake components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stopping distance. A bicycle equipped with only handbrakes shall  be tested for stopping distance by a rider of at least 68.1 kg (150 lb)  weight in accordance with the performance test, Sec. 1512.18(d)(2) (v)  and (vi), and shall have a stopping distance of no greater than 4.57 m  (15 ft) from the actual test speed as determined by the equivalent  ground speed specified in Sec. 1512.18(d)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hand lever access. Hand lever mechanisms shall be located on the  handlebars in a position that is readily   accessible to the rider when in a normal riding position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grip dimension. The grip dimension (maximum outside dimension  between the brake hand lever and the handlebars in the plane containing  the centerlines of the handgrip and the hand brake lever) shall not  exceed 89 mm (3\1/2\ in) at any point between the pivot point of the  lever and lever midpoint; the grip dimension for sidewalk bicycles shall  not exceed 76 mm (3 in). The grip dimension may increase toward the open  end of the lever but shall not increase by more than 12.7 mm (\1/2\ in)  except for the last 12.7 mm (\1/2\ in) of the lever. (See figure 5 of  this part 1512.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Attachment. Brake assemblies shall be securely attached to the  frame by means of fasteners with locking devices such as a lock washer,  locknut, or equivalent and shall not loosen during the rocking test,  Sec. 1512.18(d)- (2)(iii). The cable anchor bolt shall not cut any of  the cable strands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Operating force. A force of less than 44.5 N (10 lbf) shall  cause the brake pads to contact the braking surface of the wheel when  applied to the handlever at a point 25 mm (1.0 in) from the open end of  the handlever.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pad and pad holders. Caliper brake pad shall be replaceable and  adjustable to engage the braking surface without contacting the tire or  spokes and the pad holders shall be securely attached to the caliper  assembly. The brake pad material shall be retained in its holder without  movement when the bicycle is loaded with a rider of at least 68.1 kg  (150 lb) weight and is rocked forward and backward as specified in the  rocking test, Sec. 1512.18(d)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Hand lever location. The rear brake shall be actuated by a  control located on the right handlebar and the front brake shall be  actuated by a control located on the left handlebar. The left-hand/ right-hand locations may be reversed in accordance with an individual  customer order. If a single hand lever is used to actuate both front and  rear brakes, it shall meet all applicable requirements for hand levers  and shall be located on either the right or left handlebar in accordance  with the customer's preference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Hand lever extensions. Bicycles equipped with hand lever  extensions shall be tested with the extension levers in place and the  hand lever extensions shall also be considered to be hand levers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Footbrakes. All footbrakes shall be tested in accordance with  the force test, Sec. 1512.18(e)(2), and the measured braking force  shall not be less than 178 N (40 lbf) for an applied pedal force of 310  N (70 lbf).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stopping distance. Bicycles equipped with footbrakes (except  sidewalk bicycles) shall be tested in accordance with the performance  test, Sec. 1512.18(e)(3), by a rider of at least 68.1 kg (150 lb)  weight and shall have a stopping distance of no greater than 4.57 m (15  ft) from an actual test speed of at least 16 km/h (10 mph). If the  bicycle has a footbrake only and the equivalent groundspeed of the  bicycle is in excess of 24 km/h (15 mph) (in its highest gear ratio at a  pedal crank rate of 60 revolutions per minute), \3\ the stopping  distance shall be 4.57 m (15 ft) from an actual test speed of 24 km/h  (15 mph) or greater. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\3\ This is proportional to a gear development greater than 6.67 m  (21.9 ft) in the bicycle's highest gear ratio. Gear development is the  distance the bicycle travels in meters, in one crank revolution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating force. Footbrakes shall be actuated by a force applied  to the pedal in a direction opposite to that of the drive force, except  where brakes are separate from the drive pedals and the applied force is  in the same direction as the drive force.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Crank differential. The differential between the drive and brake  positions of the crank shall be not more than 60[deg] with the crank  held against each position under a torque of no less than 13.6 N-m (10  ft-lb).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Independent operation. The brake mechanism shall function  independently of any drive-gear positions or adjustments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Footbrakes and handbrakes in combination. Bicycles equipped with  footbrakes and handbrakes shall meet all the requirements for footbrakes  in Sec. 1512.5(c), including the tests specified. In addition, if the  equivalent ground speed of the bicycle is 24 km/h (15 mph) or greater  (in its highest gear ratio at   a pedal crank rate of 60 revolutions per minute), \3\ the actual test  speed specified in Sec. 1512.18(e)(3) shall be increased to 24 km/h (15  mph) and both braking systems may be actuated to achieve the required  stopping distance of 4.57 m (15 ft).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sidewalk bicycles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sidewalk bicycles shall not have  handbrakes only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sidewalk bicycles with a seat height of 560 mm (22 in) or  greater (with seat height adjusted to its lowest position) shall be  equipped with a footbrake meeting all the footbrake requirements of  Sec. 1512.5(c), including the specified tests except that the braking  force transmitted to the rear wheel shall be in accordance with the  sidewalk bicycle footbrake force tests, Sec. 1512.18(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sidewalk bicycles with a seat height less than 560 mm (22 in)  (with seat height adjusted to its lowest position) and not equipped with  a brake shall not have a freewheel feature. Such sidewalk bicycles  equipped with a footbrake shall be tested for brake force in accordance  with the sidewalk bicycle footbrake force test, Sec. 1512.18(f). Such  sidewalk bicycles not equipped with brakes shall be identified with a  permanent label clearly visible from a distance of 3.1 m (10 ft) in  daylight conditions and promotional display material and shipping  cartons shall prominently display the words ``No Brakes.''</p>
