                            <p class="depth0">While nothing contained in section 203 of the Act shall be construed as an amendment to, or modification of the rights protected by section 8(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, activities protected by such

section of the said Act are not for that reason exempted from the reporting requirements of section 203(a) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 and Sec. 405.2, and, if otherwise subject to such reporting requirements, are required to be reported if they have been engaged in during the course of the reporting fiscal year. However, the information required to be reported in Question 8C of Form LM-10 does not include matters protected by section 8(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, because the definition in section 203(g) of the term ``interfere with, restrain, or coerce'', which is used in Question 8C does not cover such matters.
