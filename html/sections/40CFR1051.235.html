                                Sec.  1051.235  What emission testing must I perform for my application
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show  compliance with the emission standards in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test your emission-data vehicles using the procedures and  equipment specified in subpart F of this part. Where specifically  required or allowed, test the engine instead of the vehicle. For  evaporative emissions, test the fuel system components separate from the  vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Select from each engine family an emission-data vehicle, and a  fuel system for each fuel type with a configuration that is most likely  to exceed the   emission standards, using good engineering judgment. Consider the  emission levels of all exhaust constituents over the full useful life of  the vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may measure emissions from any of your test vehicles or  engines (or any other vehicles or engines from the engine family), as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other  facility. If we do this, you must deliver the test vehicle or engine to  a test facility we designate. The test vehicle or engine you provide  must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic  control units, and other emission-related components not normally  attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your  plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the  instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If we measure emissions on one of your test vehicles or engines,  the results of that testing become the official emission results. Unless  we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data  in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before we test one of your vehicles or engines, we may set its  adjustable parameters to any point within the physically adjustable  ranges (see Sec.  1051.115(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before we test one of your vehicles or engines, we may calibrate  it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider  an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply where we  determine that an engine parameter is not an adjustable parameter (as  defined in Sec.  1051.801) but that it is subject to production  variability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may use previously generated emission data in the following  cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model  year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The engine family from the previous model year differs from the  current engine family only with respect to model year or other  characteristics unrelated to emissions. You may also ask to add a  configuration subject to Sec.  1051.225.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The emission-data vehicle from the previous model year remains  the appropriate emission-data vehicle under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The data show that the emission-data vehicle would meet all  the requirements that apply to the engine family covered by the  application for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may submit emission data for equivalent engine families  performed to show compliance with other standards (such as California  standards) instead of doing new tests, but only if the data show that  the test vehicle or engine would meet all of this part's requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may submit evaporative emission data measured by a fuel  system supplier. We may require you to verify that the testing was  conducted in accordance with the applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may require you to test a second vehicle or engine of the  same or different configuration in addition to the vehicle or engine  tested under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and  later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are  equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may  reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you are a small-volume manufacturer, you may certify by  design on the basis of preexisting exhaust emission data for similar  technologies and other relevant information, and in accordance with good  engineering judgment. In those cases, you are not required to test your  vehicles. This is called ``design-certification'' or ``certifying by  design.'' To certify by design, you must show that the technology used  on your engines is sufficiently similar to the previously tested  technology that a person reasonably familiar with emission-control  technology would believe that your engines will comply with the emission  standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For fuel tanks that are certified based on permeability  treatments for plastic fuel tanks, you do not need to test each engine  family. However, you must use good engineering judgment to determine  permeation rates for the   tanks. This requires that more than one fuel tank be tested for each set  of treatment conditions. You may not use test data from a given tank for  any other tanks that have thinner walls. You may, however, use test data  from a given tank for other tanks that have thicker walls. This applies  to both low-hour (i.e., baseline testing) and durability testing. Note  that Sec.  1051.245 allows you to use design-based certification instead  of generating new emission data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Measure CO2 and CH4 with each low-hour  certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065  starting in the 2011 and 2012 model years, respectively. Also measure  N2O with each low-hour certification test using the  analytical equipment and procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065  starting in the 2013 model year for any engine family that depends on  NOx aftertreatment to meet emission standards. Small-volume  manufacturers may omit measurement of N2O and CH4;  other manufacturers may provide appropriate data and/or information and  omit measurement of N2O and CH4 as described in 40  CFR 1065.5. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other  results to report a single weighted value for each constituent. Round  the final values as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Round CO2 to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr or 1 g/km, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Round N2O to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr or 0.001 g/km,  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Round CH4 to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr or 0.001 g/km,  as appropriate.
