                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A participant electing a full post-employment withdrawal can use all or a portion of his or her account balance to purchase a life annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a participant has a traditional balance and a Roth balance, the TSP must purchase two separate annuity contracts for the participant: One from the portion of the withdrawal distributed from his or her traditional balance and one from the portion of the withdrawal distributed from his or her Roth balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A participant cannot select only one balance (traditional or Roth) from which to purchase an annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A participant cannot elect to purchase an annuity contract with less than $3,500.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a participant who has a traditional balance and a Roth balance elects to use 100% of his or her withdrawal to purchase a life annuity and both the traditional balance and the Roth balance are below $3,500, the TSP will reject the participant's request. If only one balance is below $3,500, then the TSP will pay that balance to the participant in a single payment and use the balance that is at least $3,500 to purchase an annuity in accordance with the participant's election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a participant who has a Roth balance and traditional balance makes a mixed withdrawal election and both the traditional portion of the amount designated to purchase an annuity and the Roth portion of the amount designated to purchase an annuity are below $3,500, the TSP will reject the withdrawal request. If only one portion is below $3,500, then the TSP will pro rate that portion among the participant's other elected withdrawal options and use the portion that is at least $3,500 to purchase an annuity in accordance with the participant's election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The TSP will purchase the annuity from the TSP's annuity vendor using the participant's entire account balance or the portion specified, unless an amount must be paid directly to the participant to satisfy any applicable minimum distribution requirement of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event that a minimum distribution is required by section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code before the date of the first annuity payment, the TSP will compute that amount, and pay it directly to the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An annuity will provide a payment for life to the participant and, if applicable, to the participant's survivor, in accordance with the type of annuity chosen. The TSP annuity vendor will make the first annuity payment approximately 30 days after the TSP purchases the annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The amount of an annuity payment will depend on the type of annuity chosen, the participant's age when the annuity is purchased (and the age of the joint annuitant, if applicable), the amount used to purchase the annuity, and the interest rate available when the annuity is purchased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Participants may choose among the following types of annuities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A single life annuity with level payments. This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant as long as the participant lives. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A joint life annuity for the participant and spouse with level payments.

This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant, as long as both the participant and spouse are alive, and monthly payments to the survivor, as long as the survivor is alive. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant, although the amount received will depend on the type of survivor benefit elected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A joint life annuity for the participant and another person with level payments. This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant as long as both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive, and monthly payments to the survivor as long as the survivor is alive. The amount of the monthly payment remains constant. The joint annuitant must be either a former spouse or a person who has an insurable interest in the participant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person has an ``insurable interest in the participant'' if the person is financially dependent on the participant and could reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the participant's continued life.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A relative (either blood or adopted, but not by marriage) who is closer than a first cousin is presumed to have an insurable interest in the participant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A participant can establish that a person not described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section has an insurable interest in him or her by submitting, with the annuity request, an affidavit from a person other than the participant or the joint annuitant that demonstrates that the designated joint annuitant has an insurable interest in the participant (as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Either a single life or joint (with spouse) life annuity with increasing payments. This annuity provides monthly payments to the participant only, or to the participant and spouse, as applicable. The monthly payments are adjusted once each year on the anniversary of the first payment, based on the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Each year, the percentage change in the monthly unadjusted CPI-W index for July, August, and September over the monthly unadjusted CPI-W index for July, August, and September of the prior year is calculated. The following calendar year, the amount of the monthly payment is adjusted by the lesser of 3 percent or the percentage increase in the CPI-W, if any. In no case will the amount of the monthly payment be decreased based on the CPI-W. If the participant chooses a joint life annuity, the annual increase also applies to benefits received by the survivor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the TSP must purchase two annuity contracts, the type of annuity, the annuity features, and the joint annuitant (if applicable) selected by the participant will apply to both annuities purchased. A participant cannot elect more than one type of annuity by which to receive a withdrawal, or portion thereof, from any one account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A participant who chooses a joint life annuity (with a spouse, a former spouse, or a person with an insurable interest) must choose either a 50 percent or a 100 percent survivor benefit. The survivor benefit applies when either the participant or the joint annuitant dies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A 50 percent survivor benefit provides a monthly payment to the survivor which is 50 percent of the amount of the payment that is made when both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A 100 percent survivor benefit provides a monthly payment to the survivor, which is equal to the amount of the payment that is made when both the participant and the joint annuitant are alive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Either the 50 percent or the 100 percent survivor benefit may be combined with any joint life annuity option. However, the 100 percent survivor benefit can only be combined with a joint annuity with a person other than the spouse (or a former spouse, if required by a retirement benefits court order) if the joint annuitant is not more than 10 years younger than the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The following features are mutually exclusive, but can be combined with certain types of annuities, as indicated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cash refund. This feature provides that, if the participant (and joint annuitant, where applicable) dies before an amount equal to the balance used to

purchase the annuity has been paid out, the difference between the balance used to purchase the annuity and the sum of monthly payments already made will be paid to the beneficiary(ies) designated by the participant (or by the joint annuitant, where applicable). This feature can be combined with any type of annuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ten-year certain. This feature provides that, if the participant dies before annuity payments have been made for 10 years (120 payments), monthly payments will be made to the beneficiary(ies) until 120 payments have been made. This feature can be combined with any single life annuity, but cannot be combined with a joint life annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Once an annuity has been purchased, the type of annuity, the annuity features, and the identity of the joint annuitant cannot be changed, and the annuity cannot be terminated.
