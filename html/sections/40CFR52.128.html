Opacity Observations</p><p class="depth0">Conduct opacity observations in accordance with Reference Method 9  (40 CFR Part 60, appendix A) and Methods 203A and 203C of this appendix,  with opacity readings taken at five second observation intervals and two  consecutive readings per plume beginning with the first reading at zero  seconds, in accordance with Method 203C, sections 2.3.2. and 2.4.2 of  this appendix. Conduct visible opacity tests only on dry unpaved  surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch) and on days  when average wind speeds do not exceed 15 miles per hour (mph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Method 203A--Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From</p><p class="depth0">Stationary Sources for Time-Arranged Regulations</p><p class="depth0">Method 203A is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60  Appendix A) except for the data-reduction procedures, which provide for  averaging times other than 6 minutes. That is, using Method 203A with a  6-minute averaging time would be the same as following EPA Method 9 (40  CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Additionally, Method 203A provides procedures  for fugitive dust applications. The certification procedures provided in  section 3 are virtually identical to Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix  A) and are provided here, in full, for clarity and convenience.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability and Principle</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination  of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for time- averaged regulations. A time-averaged regulation is any regulation that  requires averaging visible emission data to determine the opacity of  visible emissions over a specific time period.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible  emissions is determined visually by an observer qualified according to  the procedures of section 3.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">An observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method  shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity  of emissions.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Procedures for Emissions from Stationary Sources. These  procedures are not applicable to this section.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions. These procedures  are applicable for the determination of the opacity of fugitive  emissions by a qualified observer. The qualified field observer should  do the following:</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Position. Stand at a position at least 5 meters from the  fugitive dust source in order to provide a clear view of the emissions  with the sun oriented in the 140-degree sector to the back. Consistent  as much as possible with maintaining the above requirements, make  opacity observations from a position such that the line of vision is  approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction. As much as  possible, if multiple plumes are involved, do not include more than one  plume in the line of sight at one time.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Field Records. Record the name of the plant or site, fugitive  source location, source type [pile, stack industrial process unit,  incinerator, open burning operation activity, material handling  (transfer, loading, sorting, etc.)], method of control used, if any,  observer's name, certification data and affiliation,   and a sketch of the observer's position relative to the fugitive source.  Also, record the time, estimated distance to the fugitive source  location, approximate wind direction, estimated wind speed, description  of the sky condition (presence and color of clouds), observer's position  relative to the fugitive source, and color of the plume and type of  background on the visible emission observation form when opacity  readings are initiated and completed.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 Observations. Make opacity observations, to the extent  possible, using a contrasting background that is perpendicular to the  line of vision. For roads, storage piles, and parking lots, make opacity  observations approximately 1 meter above the surface from which the  plume is generated. For other fugitive sources, make opacity  observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the  plume where condensed water vapor is not present. For intermittent  sources, the initial observation should begin immediately after a plume  has been created above the surface involved. Do not look continuously at  the plume but, instead, observe the plume momentarily at 15-second  intervals.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Recording Observations. Record the opacity observations to the  nearest 5 percent every 15 seconds on an observational record sheet.  Each momentary observation recorded represents the average opacity of  emissions for a 15-second period.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Data Reduction for Time-Averaged Regulations. A set of  observations is composed of an appropriate number of consecutive  observations determined by the averaging time specified. Divide the  recorded observations into sets of appropriate time lengths for the  specified averaging time. Sets must consist of consecutive observations;  however, observations immediately preceding and following interrupted  observations shall be deemed consecutive. Sets need not be consecutive  in time and in no case shall two sets overlap, resulting in multiple  violations. For each set of observations, calculate the appropriate  average opacity.</p><p class="depth0">3. Qualification and Testing</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Certification Requirements. To receive certification as a  qualified observer, a candidate must be tested and demonstrate the  ability to assign opacity readings in 5 percent increments to 25  different black plumes and 25 different white plumes, with an error not  to exceed 15 percent opacity on any one reading and an average error not  to exceed 7.5 percent opacity in each category. Candidates shall be  tested according to the procedures described in paragraph 3.2. Any smoke  generator used pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke  meter which meets the requirements of paragraph 3.3. Certification tests  that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 are not  valid.</p><p class="depth0">The certification shall be valid for a period of 6 months, and after  each 6-month period, the qualification procedures must be repeated by an  observer in order to retain certification.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Certification Procedure. The certification test consists of  showing the candidate a complete run of 50 plumes, 25 black plumes and  25 white plumes, generated by a smoke generator. Plumes shall be  presented in random order within each set of 25 black and 25 white  plumes. The candidate assigns an opacity value to each plume and records  the observation on a suitable form. At the completion of each run of 50  readings, the score of the candidate is determined. If a candidate fails  to qualify, the complete run of 50 readings must be repeated in any  retest. The smoke test may be administered as part of a smoke school or  training program, and may be preceded by training or familiarization  runs of the smoke generator during which candidates are shown black and  white plumes of known opacity.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Smoke Generator Specifications. Any smoke generator used for the  purpose of paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter installed  to measure opacity across the diameter of the smoke generator stack. The  smoke meter output shall display in-stack opacity, based upon a path  length equal to the stack exit diameter on a full 0 to 100 percent chart  recorder scale. The smoke meter optical design and performance shall  meet the specifications shown in Table A. The smoke meter shall be  calibrated as prescribed in paragraph 3.3.1 prior to conducting each  smoke reading test. At the completion of each test, the zero and span  drift, shall be checked, and if the drift exceeds 1 percent opacity, the condition shall be corrected  prior to conducting any subsequent test runs. The smoke meter shall be  demonstrated at the time of installation to meet the specifications  listed in Table A. This demonstration shall be repeated following any  subsequent repair or replacement of the photocell or associated  electronic circuitry including the chart recorder or output meter, or  every 6 months, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1 Calibration. The smoke meter is calibrated after allowing a  minimum of 30 minutes warm-up by alternately producing simulated opacity  of 0 percent and 100 percent. When stable response at 0 percent or 100  percent is noted, the smoke meter is adjusted to produce an output of 0  percent or 100 percent, as appropriate. This calibration shall be  repeated until stable 0 percent and 100 percent readings are produced  without adjustment. Simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values  may be produced by alternately switching the power to the light   source on and off while the smoke generator is not producing smoke.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2 Smoke Meter Evaluation. The smoke meter design and performance  are to be evaluated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.1 Light Source. Verify from manufacturer's data and from  voltage measurements made at the lamp, as installed, that the lamp is  operated within 5 percent of the nominal rated  voltage.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.2 Spectral Response of Photocell. Verify from manufacturer's  data that the photocell has a photopic response; i.e., the spectral  sensitivity of the cell shall closely approximate the standard spectral- luminosity curve for photopic vision which is referenced in (b) of Table  A.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.3 Angle of View. Check construction geometry to ensure that  the total angle of view of the smoke plume, as seen by the photocell,  does not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of view as  follows:  [phis]v = 2 tan-1 d/2L  Where:  [phis]v = total angle of view; d = the photocell diameter + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and L = distance from the photocell to the limiting aperture.</p><p class="depth0">The limiting aperture is the point in the path between the photocell  and the smoke plume where the angle of view is most restricted. In smoke  generator smoke meters, this is normally an orifice plate.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.4 Angle of Projection. Check construction geometry to ensure  that the total angle of projection of the lamp on the smoke plume does  not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of projection as  follows:  [phis]p = 2 tan-1 d/2L  Where:  [phis]p = total angle of projection; d = the sum of the length of the lamp filament + the diameter of the</p><p class="depth0">limiting aperture; and L = the distance from the lamp to the limiting aperture.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.5 Calibration Error. Using neutral-density filters of known  opacity, check the error between the actual response and the theoretical  linear response of the smoke meter. This check is accomplished by first  calibrating the smoke meter according to 3.3.1 and then inserting a  series of three neutral-density filters of nominal opacity of 20, 50,  and 75 percent in the smoke meter path length. Use filters calibrated  within 2 percent. Care should be taken when  inserting the filters to prevent stray light from affecting the meter.  Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each filter. The  maximum opacity error on any one reading shall be 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.6 Zero and Span Drift. Determine the zero and span drift by  calibrating and operating the smoke generator in a normal manner over a  1-hour period. The drift is measured by checking the zero and span at  the end of this period.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2.7 Response Time. Determine the response time by producing the  series of five simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values and  observing the time required to reach stable response. Opacity values of  0 percent and 100 percent may be simulated by alternately switching the  power to the light source off and on while the smoke generator is not  operating.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Additionally, Method 203C provides procedures for fugitive dust  applications which were unavailable when Method 9 was promulgated. The  certification procedures in section 3 are   identical to Method 9. These certification procedures are provided in  Method 203A as well, and, therefore, have not been repeated in this  method.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability and Principle</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination  of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for  instantaneous limitations. An instantaneous limitation regulation is an  opacity limit which is never to be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible  emissions is determined visually by a qualified observer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">The observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method  shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity  of emissions.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Procedures for Emissions From Stationary Sources. Same as 2.1,  Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Position. Same as 2.1.1, Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Field Records. Same as 2.1.2, Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Observations. Make opacity observations at the point of  greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water  vapor is not present.</p><p class="depth0">Do not look continuously at the plume. Instead, observe the plume  momentarily at the interval specified in the subject regulation. Unless  otherwise specified, a 15-second observation interval is assumed.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.1 Attached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.1, Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3.2 Detached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.2, Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Position. Same as section 2.2.1, Method 203A.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Field Records.

Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A, except, observe the  plume momentarily at 5-second intervals.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Recording Observations. Record opacity observations to the  nearest 5 percent at the prescribed interval on an observational record  sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average of  emissions for the prescribed period. If a 5-second observation period is  not specified in the applicable regulation, a 15-second interval is  assumed. The overall time for which recordings are made shall be of a  length appropriate to the regulation for which opacity is being  measured.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.1 Recording Observations for 15-second Observation Interval  Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 15- second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary  observation recorded represents the average of emissions for a 15-second  period.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.2 Recording Observations for 5-second Observation Interval  Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 5- second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary  observation recorded represents the average of emissions for 5-second  period.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Data Reduction for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations. For an  instantaneous limitation regulation, a 1-minute averaging time will be  used. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of  consecutive observations. A set is composed of the consecutive  observations made in 1 minute. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and  in no case shall two sets overlap. Reduce opacity observations by  dividing the sum of all observations recorded in a set by the number of  observations recorded in each set.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1 Data Reduction for 15-second Observation Intervals. Reduce  opacity observations by averaging four consecutive observations recorded  at 15-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record  sheet into sets of four consecutive observations. For each set of four  observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the four  observations and dividing this sum by four.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2 Data Reduction for 5-second Observation Intervals. Reduce  opacity observations by averaging 12 consecutive observations recorded  at 5-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record  sheet into sets of 12 consecutive observations. For each set of 12  observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the 12  observations and dividing this sum by 12.</p><p class="depth0">3.

Silt Content</p><p class="depth0">Conduct the following test method to determine the silt loading and  silt content of unpaved road and unpaved parking lot surfaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area 30 cm by  30 cm (1 foot by 1 foot) in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm or  until a hard subsurface is reached, whichever occurs first. Use a brush  and dustpan or other similar device. Collect the sample from a  routinely-traveled portion of the surface which receives a preponderance  of vehicle traffic, i.e. as commonly evidenced by tire tracks. Conduct  sweeping slowly so that fine surface material is not released into the  air. Only collect samples from surfaces that are not wet or damp due to  precipitation or dew.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain a shallow, lightweight container and a scale with  readings in half ounce increments or less. Place the scale on a level  surface and zero it with the weight of the empty container. Transfer the  entire sample collected to the container, minimizing escape of particles  into the air. Weigh the sample and record its weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings:  4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in order  according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening at  the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve.  Pour the entire sample into the top sieve, minimizing escape of  particles into the air by positioning the sieve/collector pan unit in an  enclosed or wind barricaded area. Cover the sieve/collector pan unit  with a lid. Shake the covered sieve/collector pan unit vigorously for a  period of at least one (1) minute in both the horizontal and vertical  planes. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble  each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is  removed, examine it for a complete separation of material in order to  ensure that all material has been sifted to the finest sieve through  which it can pass. If not, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan  unit and shake it for period of at least one (1) minute. After  disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, transfer the material which  is captured in the collector pan into the lightweight container  originally used to collect and weigh the sample. Minimize escape of  particles into the air when transferring the material into the  container. Weigh the container with the material from the collector pan  and record its weight. Multiply the resulting weight by 0.38 if the  source is an unpaved road or by 0.55 if the source is an unpaved parking  lot to estimate silt loading. Divide by the total sample weight and  multiply by 100 to arrive at the percent silt content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> As an alternative to conducting the procedure described above  in section I.B.(ii) and section I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the sample  (collected according to section I.B.(i) of this appendix) may be taken  to an independent testing laboratory or engineering facility for silt  loading (e.g. net weight < 200 mesh) and silt content analysis according  to the following test method from ``Procedures For Laboratory Analysis  Of Surface/Bulk Dust Loading Samples'', (Fifth Edition, Volume I,  Appendix C.2.3 ``Silt Analysis'', 1995), AP-42, Office of Air Quality  Planning & Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research  Triangle Park, North Carolina.</p><p class="depth0">1. Objective--Several open dust emission factors have been found to  be correlated with the silt content(< 200 mesh) of the material being  disturbed. The basic procedure for silt content determination is  mechanical, dry sieving. For sources other than paved roads, the same  sample which was oven-dried to determine moisture content is then  mechanically sieved.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Procedure--Select the appropriate 20-cm (8-in.) diameter, 5-cm  (2-in.) deep sieve sizes.</p><p class="depth0">Recommended U. S. Standard Series sizes are \3/8\ in., No. 4, No.  40, No. 100, No. 140, No. 200, and a pan. Comparable Tyler Series sizes  can also be used. The No. 20 and the No. 200 are mandatory. The others  can be varied if the recommended sieves are not available, or if buildup  on 1 particulate sieve during sieving indicates that an intermediate  sieve should be inserted.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Obtain a mechanical sieving device, such as a vibratory shaker  or a Roto-Tap [delta] \1\ without the tapping function. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ CFR part 60, App. A, Meth. 5, 2.1.2, footnote 2. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Clean the sieves with compressed air and/or a soft brush. Any  material lodged in the sieve openings or adhering to the sides of the  sieve should be removed, without handling the screen roughly, if  possible.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Obtain a scale (capacity of at least 1600 grams [g] or 3.5 lb)  and record make, capacity, smallest division, date of last calibration,  and accuracy. (See Figure A)</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Weigh the sieves and pan to determine tare weights. Check the  zero before every weighing. Record the weights.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 After nesting the sieves in decreasing order of size, and with  pan at the bottom, dump dried laboratory sample (preferably immediately  after moisture analysis) into the top sieve. The sample should weigh  between [cent] 400 and 1600 g ([cent] 0.9 and 3.5 lb). This amount will  vary for finely textured materials, and 100 to 300 g may be sufficient  when 90% of the sample passes a No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve. Brush any fine  material adhering to the sides of the container into the top sieve   and cover the top sieve with a special lid normally purchased with the  pan.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Place nested sieves into the mechanical sieving device and sieve  for 10 minutes (min). Remove pan containing minus No. 200 and weigh.  Repeat the sieving at 10-min intervals until the difference between 2  successive pan sample weighings (with the pan tare weight subtracted) is  less than 3.0%. Do not sieve longer than 40 min.</p><p class="depth0">2.8 Weigh each sieve and its contents and record the weight. Check  the zero before every weighing.</p><p class="depth0">2.9 Collect the laboratory sample. Place the sample in a separate  container if further analysis is expected.</p><p class="depth0">2.10 Calculate the percent of mass less than the 200 mesh screen (75  micrometers [[micro]m]).

In order  to simplify the sieve test procedures in section I.B.(ii) and section  I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the three samples may be combined as long as  all material is sifted to the finest sieve through which it can pass,  each sample weighs within 1 ounce of the other two samples, and the  combined weight of the samples and unit area from which they were  collected is calculated and recorded accurately.</p><p class="depth0">II. Vacant Lots</p><p class="depth0">The following test methods shall be used for determining whether a  vacant lot, or portion thereof, has a stabilized surface.</p><p class="depth0">Should a disturbed vacant lot contain more than one type of  disturbance, soil, vegetation or other characteristics which are visibly  distinguishable, test each representative surface for stability  separately in random areas according to the test methods in section II.  of this appendix and include or eliminate it from the total size  assessment of disturbed surface area(s) depending upon test method  results. A vacant lot surface shall be considered stabilized if any of  the test methods in section II. of this appendix indicate that the  surface is stabilized such that the conditions defined in paragraph  (b)(16)(ii) of this section are met:</p><p class="depth0">1. Visible Crust Determination</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where a visible crust exists, drop a steel ball with a diameter  of 15.9 millimeters (0.625 inches) and a mass ranging from 16 to 17  grams from a distance of 30 centimeters (one foot) directly above (at a  90 degree angle perpendicular to) the soil surface. If blowsand is  present, clear the blowsand from the surfaces on which the visible crust  test method is conducted. Blowsand is defined as thin deposits of loose  uncombined grains covering less than 50 percent of a vacant lot which  have not originated from the representative vacant lot surface being  tested. If material covers a visible crust which is not blowsand, apply  the test method in section II.2 of this appendix to the loose material  to determine whether the surface is stabilized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A sufficient crust is defined under the following conditions:  once a ball has been dropped according to section II.1.(i) of this   appendix, the ball does not sink into the surface so that it is  partially or fully surrounded by loose grains and, upon removing the  ball, the surface upon which it fell has not been pulverized so that  loose grains are visible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct three tests, dropping the ball once per test, within a  survey area the size of one foot by one foot. The survey area shall be  considered sufficiently crusted if at least two out of three tests meet  the definition in section II.1.(ii) of this appendix. Select at least  two other survey areas that represent the disturbed surface area and  repeat this procedure. Whether a sufficient crust covers the disturbed  surface area shall be based on a determination that all of the survey  areas tested are sufficiently crusted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At any given site, the existence of a sufficient crust covering  one portion of a disturbed surface may not represent the existence or  protectiveness of a crust on another disturbed surface(s). Repeat the  visible crust test as often as necessary on each representative  disturbed surface area for an accurate assessment of all disturbed  surfaces at a given site.</p><p class="depth0">2. Determination of Threshold Friction Velocity (TFV)</p><p class="depth0">For disturbed surface areas that are not crusted or vegetated,  determine threshold friction velocity (TFV) according to the following  sieving field procedure (based on a 1952 laboratory procedure published  by W. S. Chepil).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 4  millimeters (mm), 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in  order according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening  at the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve.  Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area at least 30 cm  by 30 cm in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm using a brush and  dustpan or other similar device. Only collect soil samples from dry  surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch). Remove any  rocks larger than 1 cm in diameter from the sample. Pour the sample into  the top sieve (4 mm opening) and cover the sieve/collector pan unit with  a lid. Minimize escape of particles into the air when transferring  surface soil into the sieve/collector pan unit. Move the covered sieve/ collector pan unit by hand using a broad, circular arm motion in the  horizontal plane. Complete twenty circular arm movements, ten clockwise  and ten counterclockwise, at a speed just necessary to achieve some  relative horizontal motion between the sieves and the particles. Remove  the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble each sieve  separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is removed,  examine it for loose particles. If loose particles have not been sifted  to the finest sieve through which they can pass, reassemble and cover  the sieve/collector pan unit and gently rotate it an additional ten  times. After disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, slightly tilt  and gently tap each sieve and the collector pan so that material aligns  along one side. In doing so, minimize escape of particles into the air.  Line up the sieves and collector pan in a row and visibly inspect the  relative quantities of catch in order to determine which sieve (or  whether the collector pan) contains the greatest volume of material. If  a visual determination of relative volumes of catch among sieves is  difficult, use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume. Estimate TFV  for the sieve catch with the greatest volume using Table 1, which  provides a correlation between sieve opening size and TFV.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 (Metric Units)--Determination of Threshold Friction Velocity</p><p class="depth0"><em>(TFV)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Opening   TFV (cm/</p><p class="depth0">Tyler Sieve No.                       (mm)       s) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 5..................................................       4     =10%............................  5 =5% and < 10%...................  3 < 5% and = 1%...................  2 < 1%.......................................

Determination of Flat Vegetation Cover</p><p class="depth0">Flat vegetation includes attached (rooted) vegetation or unattached  vegetative debris lying on the surface with a predominant horizontal  orientation that is not subject to movement by wind. Flat vegetation  which is dead but firmly attached shall be considered equally protective  as live vegetation. Stones or other aggregate larger than one centimeter  in diameter shall be considered protective cover in the course of  conducting the line transect method. Where flat vegetation exists,  conduct the following line transect method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stretch a one-hundred (100) foot measuring tape across a  disturbed surface area. Firmly anchor both ends of the measuring tape  into the surface using a tool such as a screwdriver with the tape  stretched taut and close to the soil surface. If vegetation exists in  regular rows, place the tape diagonally (at approximately a 45 degree  angle) away from a parallel or perpendicular position to the vegetated  rows. Pinpoint an area the size of a \3/32\ inch diameter brazing rod or  wooden dowel centered above each one-foot interval mark along one edge  of the tape. Count the number of times that flat vegetation lies  directly underneath the pinpointed area at one-foot intervals.  Consistently observe the underlying surface from a 90 degree angle  directly above each pinpoint on one side of the tape. Do not count the  underlying surface as vegetated if any portion of the pinpoint extends  beyond the edge of the vegetation underneath in any direction. If clumps  of vegetation or vegetative debris lie underneath the pinpointed area,  count the surface as vegetated unless bare soil is visible directly  below the pinpointed area. When 100 observations have been made, add  together the number of times a surface was counted as vegetated. This  total represents the percent of flat vegetation cover (e.g. if 35  positive counts were made, then vegetation cover is 35 percent). If the  disturbed surface area is too small for 100 observations, make as many  observations as possible. Then multiply the count of vegetated surface  areas by the appropriate conversion factor to obtain percent cover. For  example, if vegetation was counted 20 times within a total of 50  observations, divide 20 by 50 and multiply by 100 to obtain a flat  vegetation cover of 40 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct the above line transect test method an additional two  (2) times on areas representative of the disturbed surface and average  results.</p><p class="depth0">4. Determination of Standing Vegetation Cover</p><p class="depth0">Standing vegetation includes vegetation that is attached (rooted)  with a predominant vertical orientation. Standing vegetation which is  dead but firmly rooted shall be considered equally protective as live  vegetation. Conduct the following standing vegetation test method to  determine if 30 percent cover or more exists. If the resulting percent  cover is less than 30 percent but equal to or greater than 10 percent,  then conduct the Threshold Friction Velocity test in section II.2 of  this appendix in order to determine whether the disturbed surface area  is stabilized according to paragraph (b)(16)(ii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For standing vegetation that consists of large, separate  vegetative structures (for example, shrubs and sagebrush), select a  survey area representing the disturbed surface that is the shape of a  square with sides equal to at least ten (10) times the average height of  the vegetative structures. For smaller standing vegetation, select a  survey area of three (3) feet by 3 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Count the number of standing vegetative structures within the  survey area. Count vegetation which grows in clumps as a single unit.  Where different types of vegetation exists and/or vegetation of  different height and width exists, separate the vegetative structures  with similar dimensions into groups. Count the number of vegetative  structures in each group within the survey area. Select an individual  structure within each group that represents the average height and width  of the vegetation in the group. If the structure is dense (i.e. when  looking at it vertically from base to top there is little or zero open  air space within its perimeter), calculate and record its frontal  silhouette area according to Equation 6 of this appendix. Also use  Equation 6 if the survey area is larger than nine square feet,  estimating the average height and width of the vegetation. Otherwise,  use the procedure in section II.4.(iii) of this appendix to calculate  the Frontal Silhouette Area. Then calculate the percent cover of  standing vegetation according to Equations 7, 8 and 9 of   this appendix. (Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square feet  or square inches when calculating percent cover.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vegetative Density Factor. Cut a single, representative piece  of vegetation (or consolidated vegetative structure) to within 1 cm of  surface soil. Using a white paper grid or transparent grid over white  paper, lay the vegetation flat on top of the grid (but do not apply  pressure to flatten the structure). Grid boxes of one inch or one half  inch squares are sufficient for most vegetation when conducting this  procedure. Using a marker or pencil, outline the shape of the vegetation  along its outer perimeter according to Figure B, C or D of this  appendix, as appropriate. (Note: Figure C differs from Figure D  primarily in that the width of vegetation in Figure C is narrow at its  base and gradually broadens to its tallest height. In Figure D, the  width of the vegetation generally becomes narrower from its midpoint to  its tallest height.) Remove the vegetation and count and record the  total number of gridline intersections within the outlined area, but do  not count gridline intersections that connect with the outlined shape.  There must be at least 10 gridline intersections within the outlined  area and preferably more than 20, otherwise, use smaller grid boxes.  Draw small circles (no greater than a \3/32\ inch diameter) at each  gridline intersection counted within the outlined area. Replace the  vegetation on the grid within its outlined shape. From a distance of  approximately two feet directly above the grid, observe each circled  gridline intersection. Count and record the number of circled gridline  intersections that are not covered by any piece of the vegetation. To  calculate percent vegetative density, use Equations 10 and 11 of this  appendix. If percent vegetative density is equal to or greater than 30,  use the equation (Eq. 14, 15 or 16) that matches the outline used to  trace the vegetation (Figure B, C or D) to calculate its Frontal  Silhouette Area. If percent vegetative density is less than 30, use  Equations 12 and 13 of this appendix to calculate the Frontal Silhouette  Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Within a disturbed surface area that contains multiple types of  vegetation with each vegetation type uniformly distributed, results of  the percent cover associated with the individual vegetation types may be  added together.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey  areas representing the disturbed surface and average the results.  Height x Width = Frontal Silhouette Area Eq. 6 (Frontal Silhouette Area of Individual Vegetative Structure) x Number of  Vegetation Structures Per Group = Group Frontal Silhouette Area of Group  Eq. 7 Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 1 + Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 2  (etc.) = Total Frontal Silhouette Area Eq. 8 (Total Frontal Silhouette Area/Survey Area) x 100 = Percent Cover of  Standing Vegetation Eq. 9 [(Number of circled gridlines within the outlined area counted that are  not covered by vegetation / Total number of gridline intersections  within the outlined area) x 100] = Percent Open Space Eq. 10 100 = Percent Open Space = Percent Vegetative Density Eq. 11 Percent Vegetative Density/100 = Vegetative Density Eq. 12 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21DE99.000     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21DE99.001</p><p class="depth0">Alternative Test Methods</p><p class="depth0">Alternative test methods may be used upon obtaining the written  approval of the EPA.
