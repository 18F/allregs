Surplus dates delivered to the Committee pursuant to  Sec. 987.47 shall be pooled for sale to livestock feeders, distillers,  or manufacturers of inedible products: Provided, That if any portion of  the deliveries differs sufficiently to require separate handling, and  earn a different average return, such portion shall be handled as a  separate pool. The income from sale of surplus, after deduction of  committee expenses, shall be paid to the respective equity holders in  the pool or pools, or to their assignees, on the basis of the weight of  dates each delivered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delivery. The Committee may refuse delivery of any surplus dates  which it determines are excessively soured, fermented, or adulterated by  palm debris, rocks, paper, wood, plastic liners, or other foreign  material. If the Committee refuses delivery, the deliverer shall be  permitted to clean such dates sufficiently to make them acceptable to  the Committee. The weight of each accepted delivery shall be that  determined by a public weightmaster or, in the absence of such weight,  that determined by the Committee on the basis of the number and size of  the containers used in the delivery. Upon delivery of surplus dates to  the Committee, the deliverer, or a designee of the Committee shall  execute CDAC Form SP-1, Delivery Manifest, showing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person to receive payment of the net proceeds for the  surplus,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date and place of loading,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If field surplus, the location and owner of the garden,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The type and number of containers loaded or dumped,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The net weight of the load, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the delivery is directly to a buyer's truck, the driver,  truck and buyer.</p><p class="depth3">Qualification to Regulation</p>
