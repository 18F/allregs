                                Sec. 195.579  What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide  that would corrode the pipeline, you must investigate the corrosive  effect of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and  take adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inhibitors. If you use corrosion inhibitors to mitigate internal  corrosion, you must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the entire part  of the pipeline system that the inhibitors are designed to protect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine the  effectiveness of the inhibitors in mitigating internal corrosion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examine the coupons or other monitoring equipment at least twice  each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 7\1/2\ months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Removing pipe. Whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you  must inspect the internal surface of the pipe for evidence of corrosion.  If you find internal corrosion requiring corrective action under  Sec. 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally  beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination, indirect method, or  both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial  action exists in the vicinity of the removed pipe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Breakout tanks. After October 2, 2000, when you install a tank  bottom lining in an aboveground breakout tank built to API Spec 12F  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 195.3), API Std 620 (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 195.3), API Std 650 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 195.3), or API Std 650's predecessor, Standard 12C, you must  install the lining in accordance with API RP 652 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 195.3). However, you don't need to comply with API  RP 652 when installing any tank for which you note in the corrosion  control procedures established under Sec. 195.402(c)(3) why compliance  with all or certain provisions of API RP 652 is not necessary for the  safety of the tank.
