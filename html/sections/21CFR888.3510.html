                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A knee joint femorotibial metal/polymer  constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to  replace part of a knee joint. The device limits translation or rotation  in one or more planes and has components that are linked together or  affined. This generic type of device includes prostheses composed of a  ball-and-socket joint located between a stemmed femoral and a stemmed  tibial component and a runner and track joint between each pair of  femoral and tibial condyles. The ball-and-socket joint is composed of a  ball at the head of a column rising from the stemmed tibial component.  The ball, the column, the tibial plateau, and the stem for fixation of  the tibial component are made of an alloy, such as cobalt-chromium- molybdenum. The ball of the tibial component is held within the socket  of the femoral component by the femoral component's flat outer surface.  The flat outer surface of the tibial component abuts both a reciprocal  flat surface within the cavity of the femoral component and flanges on  the femoral component designed to prevent distal displacement. The stem  of the femoral component is made of an alloy, such as cobalt-chromium- molybdenum, but the socket of the component is made of ultra-high  molecular weight polyethylene. The femoral component has metallic  runners which align with the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene  tracks that press-fit into the metallic tibial component. The generic  class also includes devices whose upper and lower components are linked  with a solid bolt passing through a journal bearing of greater radius,  permitting some rotation in the transverse plane, a minimal arc of  abduction/adduction. This generic type of device is limited to those  prostheses intended for use with bone cement (Sec. 888.3027).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II.</p>
