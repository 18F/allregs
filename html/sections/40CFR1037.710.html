You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may certify one or more vehicle families (or subfamilies) to an FEL above the applicable standard, subject to any applicable FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero or that a negative balance is allowed under Sec.  1037.745.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you certify a vehicle family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the vehicle family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in Sec.  1037.730. The emission credits used to

address the deficit may come from your other vehicle families that generate emission credits in the same model year (or from later model years as specified in Sec.  1037.745), from emission credits you have banked, or from emission credits you obtain through trading.</p>
