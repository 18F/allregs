                            <p class="depth0">Transfer of buildings to other Federal agencies will be accomplished  by DD Form 1354. An estimate of value will be shown on DD Form 1354,  Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, or other forms used  and, in the case of transfer without reimbursement, the following  footnote will be made: ``Transfer to (Department or Agency), adjustment  of funds not required.'' When the transfer is made at the direction of  GSA, an explanation therefor will also be made on the form. Buildings  and other improvements which are reported to GSA for screening against  requirements of other Federal agencies (Sec. Sec. 644.348 through  644.367) will be transferred to another Federal agency only at the  direction of GSA and for the amount of reimbursement, if any, determined  by GSA. Buildings and improvements which are not required to be reported  to GSA will be screened against requirements of other Federal agencies  by the responsible DE as provided in Sec. Sec. 644.333 through 644.339.   Upon request by a Federal agency for transfer of such property, the  responsible DE will determine the amount of reimbursement, if any, in  accordance with the criteria outlined in Sec. Sec. 644.400 through  644.443.</p>
