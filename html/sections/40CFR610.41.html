Each vehicle will be tested at least twice  in each configuration, as determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The first test configuration is a baseline configuration. In  this configuration the baseline or unretrofitted vehicle emissions will  be measured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A second test configuration, an adjusted configuration, may be  required at the discretion of the Administrator if a device requires  both hardware and engine parameter modifications to achieve the fuel  economy improvement. If, in the Administrator's judgment, based on a  review of the available information, the combined effects of retrofit  hardware installation and parametric adjustment could be substantially  duplicated by parametric adjustment alone, then the Administrator may  specify a second test, to evaluate such adjustment exclusive of the  retrofit hardware.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The third series of tests, in the retrofitted configuration,  will evaluate the full retrofit system installed on the vehicle.</p>
