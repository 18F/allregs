                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After all items to be welded to the inner tank have been welded in place, the inner tank must be pressure tested at the test pressure prescribed in Sec. 179.401-1. The temperature of the pressurizing medium may not exceed 38 C (100 F) during the test. The inner tank must hold the prescribed pressure for a period of not less than ten minutes without leakage or distortion. In a pneumatic test, due regard for the protection of all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved. After a hydrostatic test the container and piping must be emptied of all water and purged of all water vapor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Caulking of welded joints to stop leaks developed during the test is prohibited. Repairs to welded joints must be made as prescribed in AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix W (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).
