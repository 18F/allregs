The owner or operator may submit such a demonstration to the Regional Administrator at any time during the closure or post-closure care periods. For the purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must establish background soil values and determine whether there is a statistically significant increase over those values for all hazardous constituents specified in the facility permit under Sec. 264.271 (b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Background soil values may be based on a one-time sampling of a background plot having characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must express background values and values for hazardous constituents in the treatment zone in a form necessary for the determination of statistically significant increases under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In taking samples used in the determination of background and treatment zone values, the owner or operator must take samples at a sufficient number of sampling points and at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that represent the chemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone and the soil within the treatment zone, respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining whether a statistically significant increase has occurred, the owner or operator must compare the value of each constituent in the treatment zone to the background value for that constituent using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence that constituent presence in the treatment zone will be identified. The owner or operator must use a statistical procedure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is appropriate for the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provides a reasonable balance between the probability of falsely identifying hazardous constituent presence in the treatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real presence in the treatment zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator is not subject to regulation under Subpart F of this chapter if the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (d) of this section and if unsaturated zone monitoring under Sec. 264.278 indicates that hazardous constituents have not migrated beyond the treatment zone during the active life of the land treatment unit.
