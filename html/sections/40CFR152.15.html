A pesticide is any substance (or mixture of substances) intended for a pesticidal purpose, i.e., use for the purpose of preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest or use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant. A substance is considered to be intended for a pesticidal purpose, and thus to be a pesticide requiring registration, if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The person who distributes or sells the substance claims, states, or implies (by labeling or otherwise):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the substance (either by itself or in combination with any other substance) can or should be used as a pesticide; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the substance consists of or contains an active ingredient and that it can be used to manufacture a pesticide; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The substance consists of or contains one or more active ingredients and has no significant commercially valuable use as distributed or sold other than (1) use for pesticidal purpose (by itself or in combination with any other substance), (2) use for manufacture of a pesticide; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The person who distributes or sells the substance has actual or constructive knowledge that the substance will be used, or is intended to be used, for a pesticidal purpose.</p>
