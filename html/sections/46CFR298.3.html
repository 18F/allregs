You must include all required information  on Form MA 163 or in attached exhibits and schedules submitted with the  application. You must also include the following regarding the Vessel or  Vessels, if applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any demise charters,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time charters in excess of six months,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contracts of affreightment,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Drilling contracts, and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other contractual arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Declaration of Lobbying form. You must also file the Declaration  of Lobbying form as required by 31 U.S.C. 1352 with the initial  application as part of the formal submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attachments. Each exhibit, schedule, and attachment must contain  a statement, on the first page clearly identifying the document as an  attachment to the application. You must state on each attachment the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of the applicant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment. You must mark ``Amendment,'' on any amendment of data  contained in the application. Each   first page must contain a statement clearly identifying the document as  an amendment to your application and must include the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of the applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of application; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification required on Form MA 163.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application time schedule. You must submit each application to  us at least four (4) months prior to the anticipated date by which you  require a Letter Commitment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may consider applications with less than four (4) months  notice, prior to the anticipated date by which you require a Letter  Commitment, if you submit written documentation to us that extenuating  circumstances exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the first fifteen (15) calendar days after you submit  your application, we will preliminarily review your application for  adequacy and completeness.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If we find that your application is incomplete, or if we require  additional data, we will notify you promptly in writing, and you will  have fifteen (15) calendar days, from the date of each request for  additional information, to correct deficiencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you have not corrected the deficiencies or have not made  substantial progress toward correcting them, within the 15 calendar  days, then we may terminate the processing of your application without  prejudice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once we consider your Title XI application complete, we will act  on the application within a period of 60 calendar days, unless for good  cause, we find it necessary to extend the 60 day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> months from the submission date, unless  we extend the time period, we will notify you in writing that processing  of the application is terminated and that you may reapply at a later  date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If we terminate your application without prejudice, we will not  require you to pay a new filing fee for a later application for a  similar project that you file within one year of the termination date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you submit an application for a substantially different  project, you must pay a new filing fee. We will determine whether the  application is substantially different on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If we issue you a Letter Commitment, you must submit two (2)  sets of the Closing documentation to us for review at least six (6)  weeks prior to the anticipated Closing. The six weeks time period will  give us time to complete an adequate review of the documentation. You  must use our standard form of documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Degrees of risk. When processing applications, we will consider  the different degrees of risk involved with different applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional assurances. Before we approve your application, we  may require additional assurances if you are not a well established firm  with strong financial qualifications and strong market shares seeking  financing guarantees for replacement vessels in an established market in  which projected demand exceeds supply. The additional assurances may  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Firm charter commitments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parent company guarantees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Greater equity participation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Private financing participation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Security interest on other property; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Similar arrangements to any of these additional assurances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Filing Fee. When you submit your application, you must include a  $5,000 filing fee, which will be non-refundable, irrespective of whether  we issue a Letter Commitment. However, the $5,000 filing fee is credited  toward the investigation fee described in Sec. 298.15(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Confidential Information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If we receive a request for  release of your information, we will notify you. If you believe that  your application, including attachments, contains information you  consider to be trade secrets or commercial or financial information and  privileged or confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under  the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), you may assert a  claim of confidentiality. When submitting your application, you should  mark ``Confidential'' on the pages that you   consider confidential. The same requirement applies to any amendment to  the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FOIA requests. We will apply the procedures contained in the  Department of Transportation's regulations at 49 CFR 7.17 regarding FOIA  requests for information that the submitter has designated as  confidential. We will consider your claim of confidentiality at the time  someone requests the information under FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Statement of objections. If we receive a request for release of  your information, we will notify you. We will give you a reasonable  period of time to give us a written, detailed statement explaining your  objections to our release of the information. We will not give you  notice if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We determine that we should not disclose the information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information has been lawfully published or made available  to the public; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) requires us to disclose the  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Our notification of intent to disclose. If your objections to  release of the information do not persuade us, we will notify you of our  intent to disclose in a reasonable number of days before we intend to  disclose the information. The written notice will include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement explaining our reasons for not accepting the  submitter's disclosure objections;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the business information that we will  disclose; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A specific disclosure date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Priority. We will give priority for processing applications to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vessels capable of serving as a United States naval and military  auxiliary in time of war or national emergency,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for financing construction of equipment or vessels less  than one year old as opposed to the refinancing of existing equipment or  vessels that are one year old or older,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any applications involving the purchase of vessels currently  financed under Title XI if the purpose is to process the assumption of  the obligations,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Applications from those willing to take guarantees for less than  the normal term for that class of vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Eligible Export Vessels. We may issue a commitment to guarantee  Obligations for an Eligible Export Vessel if we determine, in our sole  discretion, that the issuance of a commitment to guarantee Obligations  for an Eligible Export Vessel will not cause us to deny an economically  sound application to issue a commitment to guarantee Obligations for  vessels documented under the laws of the United States operating in the  domestic or foreign commerce of the United States, after considering:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The status of pending applications for commitments to guarantee  obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States  and operating or to be operated in the domestic or foreign commerce of  the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The economic soundness of the applications referred to in  paragraph (k)(5)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of guarantee authority available.  (Unless indicated otherwise in this part 298, information collection  requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget  under control number 2133-0018.)  [65 FR 45152, July 20, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 62538, Nov. 5, 2003; 69  FR 61451, Oct. 19, 2004]</p>
