Additional liens will be taken only when the borrower is delinquent, the existing security is not adequate to protect FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 interests, and the borrower has substantial equity in the real estate to be mortgaged, and taking such mortgage will not prevent making an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 real estate loan, if needed, later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)-(b)</em> [Reserved]
