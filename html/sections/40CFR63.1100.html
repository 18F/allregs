Documentation of this demonstration shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec.  63.1110(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall determine, for the production of each product, whether control is required in accordance with the applicable criteria for the primary product in Sec.  63.1103. If control is required, the owner or operator shall establish separate parameter monitoring levels, as appropriate, for the production of each product. The parameter monitoring levels developed shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec.  63.1110(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Storage vessel ownership determination. To determine the process unit to which a storage vessel shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date of promulgation for an affected source under the generic MACT, that storage vessel shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are subject to standards under this subpart that have different primary products, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the process units sharing the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the date of promulgation of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected utilization for the 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by Sec.  63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use

changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another process unit; ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit; or if the applicability of this subpart to a storage vessel has been determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section and there is a significant change in the use of the storage vessel that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units that place material into, or receive materials from, the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm, the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is only one process unit at a major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recovery operation equipment ownership determination. To determine the process unit to which recovery equipment shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If recovery operation equipment is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date standards are promulgated for an affected source, that recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If recovery operation equipment is used exclusively by a single process unit, the recovery operation shall belong to that process unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If recovery operation equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operation equipment shall belong to that process unit that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operation equipment (i.e., that process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operation equipment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is a process unit subject to this subpart, the recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are process units that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operation equipment to any one of those process units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the predominant use of recovery operation equipment varies from year to year, then the predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this

subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date for standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for the recovery operations equipment, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. This determination shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by Sec.  63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If there is an unexpected change in the utilization of recovery operation equipment that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall redetermine to which process unit the recovery operation belongs by reperforming the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Overlap with other regulations. Paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section specify the applicability of this subpart YY emission point requirements when other rules may apply. Where subpart YY of this part allows an owner or operator an option to comply with one or another regulation to comply with subpart YY of this part, an owner or operator must report which regulation they choose to comply with in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec.  63.1110(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overlap of subpart YY with other regulations for storage vessels.
