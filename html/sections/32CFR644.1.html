It is not intended to be taken as absolute,  without modification, but more as a guide to insure all aspects involved  and potential problems are fully considered in planning for the  acquisition of additional lands. Proper planning in the initial stages  of any project can and should eliminate unnecessary delays during the  acquisition phase.</p><p class="depth0">Civil Works</p>
