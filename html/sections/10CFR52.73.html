In the absence of a demonstration that an entity other  than the one originally sponsoring and obtaining a design certification  is qualified to supply a design, the Commission will entertain an  application for a combined license that references a standard design  certification issued under subpart B of this part only if the entity  that sponsored and obtained the certification supplies the design for  the applicant's use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission will require, before granting a combined license  that references a standard design certification, that information  normally contained in certain procurement specifications and  construction and installation specifications be completed and available  for audit if the information is necessary for the Commission to make its  safety determinations, including the determination that the application  is consistent with the certification information.</p>
