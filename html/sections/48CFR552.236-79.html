Samples shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer or to the Architect as specified or as directed. The Contractor shall prepay all shipping charges on samples. Materials or equipment for which samples are required shall not be used in the work until approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each sample shall have a label indicating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of project building or facility, project title and contract number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name of Contractor and, if appropriate, name of subcontractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of material or equipment with specification requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Place of origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Name of producer and brand (if any).</p><p class="depth3">Samples of finished materials shall have additional markings that will identify them under the finish schedules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall mail under separate cover a letter in triplicate submitting each shipment of samples and containing the information required in paragraph (b) of this clause. He shall enclose a copy of this letter with the shipment and send a copy to the Government representative on the project.

Approved samples of hardware in good condition will be marked for identification and may be used in the work. Materials and equipment, incorporated in the work shall match the approved samples. Other samples not destroyed in testing or not approved will be returned to the Contractor at his expense if so requested at time of submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure of any material to pass the specified tests will be sufficient cause for refusal to consider, under this contract, any further samples of the same brand or make of that material or equipment which previously has proved unsatisfactory in service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Samples of various materials or equipment delivered on the site or in place may be taken by the Government representative for testing. Samples failing to meet contract requirements, or there shall be a proper adjustment of the contract price as determined by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unless otherwise specified, when tests are required only one test of each sample proposed for use will be made at the expense of the Government. Samples which do not meet specification requirements will be rejected.
