                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Food and Drug Administration will initiate no regulatory  action with respect to the continued marketing of coated tablets  containing potassium chloride or other potassium salts which supply 100  milligrams or more of potassium per tablet provided all the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 30 days from the date of publication of this statement of  policy in the Federal Register:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The labeling of the drug bears the prescription caution  statement quoted in section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to  be dispensed bears adequate information for its use by practitioners in  accord with the ``full disclosure'' labeling requirements of Sec.  201.100 of this chapter, including the following warning statement:</p><p class="depth4">Warning--There have been several reports, published and unpublished,  concerning nonspecific small-bowel lesions consisting of stenosis, with  or without ulceration, associated with the administration of enteric- coated thiazides with potassium salts. These lesions may occur with  enteric-coated potassium tablets alone or when they are used with  nonenteric-coated thiazides, or certain other oral diuretics. These  small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and  perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred.  Based on a large survey of physicians and hospitals, both United States  and foreign, the incidence of these lesions is low, and a causal  relationship in man has not been definitely established. Available  information tends to implicate enteric-coated potassium salts, although  lesions of this type also occur spontaneously. Therefore, coated  potassium-containing formulations should be administered only when  indicated, and should be discontinued immediately if abdominal pain,  distention, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding occur. Coated  potassium tablets should be used only when adequate dietary  supplementation is not practicable.   (Although the warning statement includes references to enteric-coated  potassium salt preparations, it applies to any capsule or coated tablet  of a potassium salt intended for oral ingestion without prior dilution  with an adequate volume of liquid to preclude gastrointestinal injury.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other labeling or additional advertising for the drug  conforms to the labeling described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this  section, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 202.1 and 201.100 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 90 days from the date of publication of this statement of  policy in the Federal Register, the manufacturer, packer, or distributor  of the drug shall submit a new-drug application containing satisfactory  information of the kind required by Sec. 314.50 of this chapter, with  appropriate labeling as described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Food and Drug Administration may initiate regulatory  proceedings after 30 days from the date of   publication of this section, with respect to the marketing of uncoated  tablets containing potassium chloride or other potassium salts which  supply 100 milligrams or more of potassium per tablet or with respect to  liquid preparations containing potassium chloride or other potassium  salts which supply 20 milligrams or more of potassium per milliliter,  labeled or intended for human use, unless all the following conditions  are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The labeling of the drug bears the prescription statement quoted  in section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to  be dispensed bears adequate information for its use by practitioners in  accord with the ``full disclosure'' labeling requirements of Sec.  201.100 of this chapter, including a recommendation that patients be  directed to dissolve any such tablets in an appropriate amount of liquid  and to dilute any such liquid preparations adequately to assure against  gastrointestinal injury associated with the oral ingestion of  concentrated potassium salt preparations.
