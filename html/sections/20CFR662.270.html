                            <p class="depth0">The MOU must describe the particular funding arrangements for  services and operating costs of the One-Stop delivery system. Each  partner must contribute a fair share of the operating costs of the One- Stop delivery system proportionate to the use of the system by  individuals attributable to the partner's program. There are a number of  methods, consistent with the equirements of the relevant OMB circulars,  that may be used for allocating costs among the partners. Some of these  methodologies include allocations based on direct charges, cost pooling,  indirect cost rates and activity-based cost allocation plans. Additional  guidance relating to cost allocation methods may be issued by the  Department in consultation with the other appropriate Federal agencies.</p>
