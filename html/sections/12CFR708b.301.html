Notice of Proposal to Convert to Nonfederally-Insured Status and Special</p><p class="depth2">Meeting of Members</p><p class="depth2">(Insert Name of Converting Credit Union)</p><p class="depth2">On (insert date), the board of directors of your credit union approved a proposition to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance to private insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and date) to address this proposition.</p><p class="depth2">Purpose of Meeting</p><p class="depth2">The meeting has two purposes:</p><p class="depth2">1. To consider and act upon a proposal to convert your account insurance from federal insurance to private insurance.</p><p class="depth2">2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors in authorizing the officers of the credit union to carry out the proposed conversion.</p><p class="depth2">Insurance Conversion</p><p class="depth2">Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal government. The basic federal coverage is up to $100,000, but accounts may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much more than $100,000. If the conversion is approved, your federal insurance will terminate on the effective date of the conversion. Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to $(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The private insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.

(This is an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right, however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)</p><p class="depth2">The board of directors has concluded that the proposed conversion is desirable for the following reasons: (insert reasons). (This is an optional paragraph. It may be deleted without the prior approval of the Regional Director.)</p><p class="depth2">The proposed conversion will result in the following one-time cost associated with the conversion: (List the total estimated dollar amount, including (1) the cost of conducting the vote, (2) the cost of changing the credit union's name and insurance logo, and (3) attorney and consultant fees.)</p><p class="depth2">The conversion must have the approval of a majority of members who vote on the proposal, provided at least 20 percent of the total membership participates in the voting.</p><p class="depth2">Enclosed with this Notice of Special Meeting is a ballot.
