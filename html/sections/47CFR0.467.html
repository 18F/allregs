                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the provisions of this section, an hourly fee  shall be charged for recovery of the full, allowable direct costs of  searching for and reviewing records requested under Sec. 0.460 or  Sec. 0.461, unless such fees are reduced or waived pursuant to  Sec. 0.470. The fee is based on the pay grade level of the FCC's  employee(s) who conduct(s) the search or review, or the actual hourly  rate of FCC contractors or other non-FCC personnel who conduct a search.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(1):</p><p class="depth3">The fees for FCC employees will be modified periodically to  correspond with modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress  and any such modifications will be announced by public notice and will  be posted on the Commission's Web site, http://www.fcc.gov/foia/ #feeschedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fees specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are  computed at Step 5 of each grade level based on the General Schedule or  the hourly rate of non-FCC personnel, including in addition twenty  percent for personnel benefits. Search and review fees will be assessed  in \1/4\ hour increments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Search fees may be assessed for time spent searching, even if  the Commission fails to locate responsive records or if any records  located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission shall charge only for the initial review, i.e.,  the review   undertaken initially when the Commission analyzes the applicability of a  specific exemption to a particular record. The Commission shall not  charge for review at the appeal level of an exemption already applied.  However, records or portions of records withheld in full under an  exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed  again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously  considered. The costs of such a subsequent review, under these  circumstances, are properly assessable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The fee charged will not exceed an amount based on the time  typically required to locate records of the kind requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to  exceed the greater of $25 or the amount which the requester indicated  he/she is prepared to pay, then it shall notify the requester of the  estimated amount of fees. Such a notice shall offer the requester the  opportunity to confer with Commission personnel with the object of  revising or clarifying the request. See Sec. 0.465(c)(2) and  Sec. 470(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time for processing a request for inspection shall be tolled  while conferring with the requester about his or her willingness to pay  the fees required to process the request. See Sec. 0.461(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When the search has been completed, the custodian of the records  will give notice of the charges incurred to the person who made the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The fee shall be paid to the Financial Management Division,  Office of Managing Director, or as otherwise directed by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records shall be inspected within seven days after notice is  given that they have been located and are available for inspection. See  Sec. 0.461(n). After that period, they will be returned to storage, and  additional charges may be imposed for again producing them.  [74 FR 14078, Mar. 30, 2009, as amended at 76 FR 24390, May 2, 2011]</p>
