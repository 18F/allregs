                            <p class="depth0">The Secretary shall establish two priority lists for regulating  potential occupational carcinogens. One list should include  approximately ten (10) candidates for rulemaking as Category I Potential  Carcinogens; the other approximately ten (10) candidates for rulemaking  as Category II Potential Carcinogens. The order of placement of  substances on these lists will not reflect the Secretary's determination  of the exact order in which these substances should be regulated in  rulemaking proceedings but rather a policy determination that the  Secretary plans to address some or all of these substances prior to  proceeding with a thorough scientific review of data concerning other  substances on the Candidate List. The inclusion or exclusion of any  substance on these lists shall not be subject to judicial review or be  the basis for any legal action. The Secretary may regulate a potential  occupational carcinogen which has not been placed on these lists. The  inclusion of a substance on either of these lists does not reflect a  final scientific determination that the substance is, in fact, a  Category I Potential Carcinogen or a Category II Potential Carcinogen.</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date Note: At 48 FR 243, Jan. 4, 1983, Sec. 1990.131 was  stayed in order to evaluate the impact of publishing the Candidate List  and Priority Lists and to reconsider the criteria used in establishing  the lists (see also 47 FR 187, Jan. 5, 1982).</p>
