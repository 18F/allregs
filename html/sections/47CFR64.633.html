                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification of alleged unauthorized provider change. Original default providers who are informed of an unauthorized default provider change by an iTRS user shall immediately notify the allegedly unauthorized provider and the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau of the incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral of complaint. Any iTRS provider that is informed by an iTRS user or original default provider of an unauthorized default provider change shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall inform that iTRS user of the iTRS user's right to file a complaint with the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau. iTRS providers shall also inform the iTRS user that the iTRS user may contact and file a complaint with the alleged unauthorized default provider. An original default provider shall have the right to file a complaint with the Commission in the event that one of its respective iTRS users is the subject of an alleged unauthorized default provider change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of receipt of complaint. Upon receipt of an unauthorized default provider change complaint or notification filed pursuant to this section, the Commission will notify the allegedly unauthorized provider and the Fund administrator of the complaint or notification and order that the unauthorized provider identify to the Fund administrator all minutes attributable to the iTRS user after the alleged unauthorized change of default provider is alleged to have occurred. The Fund administrator shall withhold

reimbursement for such minutes pending Commission determination of whether an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.601(a) of this part, has occurred, if it has not already done so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proof of verification. Not more than 30 days after notification of the complaint or other notification, the alleged unauthorized default provider shall provide to the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau a copy of any valid proof of verification of the default provider change. This proof of verification must clearly demonstrate a valid authorized default provider change, as that term is defined in Sec. Sec. 64.631 through 64.632 of this part. The Commission will determine whether an unauthorized change, as defined by Sec. 64.601(a) of this part, has occurred using such proof and any evidence supplied by the iTRS user or other iTRS providers. Failure by the allegedly unauthorized provider to respond or provide proof of verification will be presumed to be sufficient evidence of a violation.
