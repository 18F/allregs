Corporation ABC, an accrual method taxpayer, uses a 52/53 week year-end ending on the last Friday in December and uses four thirteen-week periods. For its year beginning December 28, 2007, ABC uses the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installments. For purposes of computing its first and second required installments, the first 3 months of A's taxable year under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will end on March 28th, the thirteenth Friday of ABC's taxable year. For purposes of its third required installment, the first 6 months of ABC's taxable year will end on June 27th, the twenty-sixth Friday of ABC's taxable year. For purposes of its fourth required installment, the first 9 months of ABC's taxable year will end on September 26th, the thirty-ninth Friday of ABC's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Same facts as Example 1 except that ABC uses thirteen four-week periods and there are 52 weeks during ABC's taxable year beginning December 28, 2007, and ending December 26, 2008. For purposes of computing ABC's first and second required installments, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first three months will be the taxable income for the first three four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through March 21, 2008) divided by 12 (number of full four-week periods in the first three months (3) multiplied by 4) and multiplied by 52 (the number of weeks in the taxable year). For

purposes of computing ABC's third required installment, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first six months will be the taxable income for the first six four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through June 13, 2008) divided by 24 and multiplied by 52. For purposes of computing ABC's fourth required installment, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first nine months will be the taxable income for the first nine four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through September 5, 2008) divided by 36 and multiplied by 52.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Same facts as Example 1 except that ABC uses the alternative method under paragraph (e)(4) of this section for computing its required installments for 2008. For purposes of computing its first and second required installments, the first three months of ABC's taxable year under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will end on March 31, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the first and second required installments. For purposes of ABC's third required installment, the first six months of ABC's taxable year will end on June 30, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the third required installment. For purposes of ABC's fourth required installment, the first nine months of ABC's taxable year will end on September 30, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the fourth required installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determination of taxable income for an annualization period--(1) In general.

An item of income is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly includible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 451 for accrual method taxpayers, section 453 for installment sales or section 460 for long-term contracts).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items of deduction. An item of deduction is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly deductible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the deduction must be paid under Sec. 1.461-1(a)(1) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income; under an accrual method of accounting, the deduction must be incurred under Sec. 1.461-1(a)(2) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income). Section 170(a)(2) and Sec. 1.170A-11(b) (charitable contributions by accrual method corporations) and Sec. 1.461-5 (recurring item exception) may not be taken into consideration by an accrual method taxpayer in any annualization period in determining whether an item of deduction has been incurred under Sec. 1.461-1(a)(2) during that annualization period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Losses.

As of March 31, 2008, ABC estimates that it will pay a year-end bonus of $500,000 to its employees if earnings remain constant throughout the tax year. ABC does not pay any of the estimated bonus liability as of March 31, 2008. On October 31, 2008, ABC declares a $600,000 bonus to its employees which is paid out on November 15, 2008, and properly deducted in ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year.

Therefore, ABC is permitted to recognize a $150,000 bonus deduction (one quarter of the $600,000 bonus liability properly recognized by ABC in the tax year ending December 31, 2008) in the first annualization period ending March 31, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC has adopted a plan under which ABC pays an annual bonus to its employees. ABC's employee bonus plan generally calls for an annual bonus equal to 2% of earnings. A bonus reserve for this amount is reported each quarter in ABC's non-tax books and records. ABC's quarterly revenues throughout the year are $10,000,000; $6,000,000; $7,000,000; and $7,000,000 respectively. As of March 31, 2008, ABC estimates that it will pay a year-end bonus of $800,000 ($10,000,000 x 4 x 2%) to its employees if earnings remain constant throughout the year. ABC does not pay any of the estimated bonus payment as of March 31, 2008. On December 31, 2008, ABC declares a $600,000 bonus to its employees which is paid out on January 15, 2009, and properly deducted in ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, ABC must allocate its employee bonus liability in a reasonably accurate manner for annualization purposes.

Allocating $200,000 ($10,000,000 x 2%) of ABC's annual bonus liability of $600,000 to ABC's first quarter based upon earnings during the quarter represents a better matching of ABC's bonus expense to earnings in the quarter as compared to allocating $150,000 to ABC's first quarter under a ratable accrual method and is consistent with the allocation provided in ABC's non-tax books and records.

On March 31, 2008, ABC pays out $2,000,000 to its employees as a quarterly bonus based upon the earnings of ABC for the period January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008. The $2,000,000 bonus is recognized as an expense on ABC's audited financial statements in the quarter ending March 31, 2008.

If the taxpayer's preceding taxable year is less than 12 months (a short taxable year), the amount of depreciation expense taken into account is annualized by multiplying the depreciation and amortization for the short taxable year by 12, and dividing the result by the number of months in the short taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor operational rules. If a taxpayer selects one of the two safe harbors provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(1) or paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this section, the taxpayer must use that safe harbor for all depreciation expenses within the annualization period for the annualized income installment. However, a taxpayer may use either the method provided for in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section or a method provided for in this paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B) of this section for each annualized income installment during the taxable year. For example, a taxpayer may use the safe harbor provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section for its first annualized income installment and may use the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section

for its second annualized income installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Short taxable years.

For this purpose, the rules applicable for computing depreciation during a short taxable year are applied on the basis of the date the taxable year is expected to end based on all relevant information available as of the last day of the annualization period. See Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) for computing depreciation expense under section 168 (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).

ABC has licensed technology from Corporation XYZ. Pursuant to the license agreement, ABC pays a license fee to XYZ equal to $.01 for every dollar of gross receipts earned by ABC. For 2008, ABC projects gross receipts of $200,000,000, of which $100,000,000 is earned by March 31, 2008. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a license fee expense of $1,000,000 ($100,000,000 x $.01) is incurred by March 31, 2008, and may be taken into account for purposes of determining the taxable income to be annualized in computing ABC's first annualized income installment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Expense not paid or incurred in the installment period. Same facts as Example 1 except that ABC does not earn any gross receipts by March 31, 2008.

On July 1, 2008, ABC purchases an annual business license from State X which permits ABC to operate its business in State X from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009. An annual payment of $12,000 is due on July 1, 2008, and ABC pays the fee on this date. ABC has not elected out of the 12-month rule provided by Sec. 1.263(a)-4(f) and therefore ABC is not required to capitalize any amount paid for the license and will recognize a $12,000 deduction for the tax year ending December 31, 2008, with respect to this license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, ABC's $12,000 business license expense must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner because ABC utilizes the 12-month rule exception provided for in the Sec. 1.263(a)-4(f). Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, ABC's deduction will be deemed to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner if the item is allocated ratably throughout the taxable year. Therefore, ABC will be permitted to allocate $3,000 of its business license deduction in its first installment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC owns real property in State Y and uses the real property in its trade or business. ABC incurs a $400,000 deduction for State Y real estate taxes during ABC's December 31, 2008, taxable year. ABC has elected to recognize its real property taxes ratably under section 461(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, ABC's $400,000 real property tax liabilities must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner. However, paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section provides that with respect to real property taxes for which an election has been made under section 461(c), ratable accrual is the only method which will be considered a reasonably accurate method. Therefore, ABC will be required to allocate its $400,000 real property taxes ratably for estimated tax purposes and thus $100,000 will be allocated to the ABC's first annualized income installment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. NOL (Net Operating Loss) deduction. Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC has a net operating loss carryover to 2008 of $2,000,000. ABC's taxable income from January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, without regard to any net operating loss deduction, is $1,500,000 (pre-NOL taxable income). Under the special rule for net operating loss deductions provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the NOL deduction is treated as an extraordinary item incurred on the first day of ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year. Therefore, the NOL deduction is taken into account after annualization for purposes of determining ABC's first annualized income installment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 and 2009 taxable years. ABC is in the business of giving dancing lessons and receives advance payments. For Federal income tax purposes, ABC uses the Deferral Method provided in section 5.02 of Rev. Proc. 2004-34 for the advance payments it receives for dance lessons. On November 1, 2008, ABC receives an advance payment of $2,400 for a 2-year contract commencing on November 1, 2008, and providing for up to 24 individual, 1-hour lessons. ABC provides 2 lessons in 2008, 12 lessons in 2009, and 10 lessons in 2010. ABC recognizes $200 in revenues in its financial statements for the last quarter of 2008. ABC recognizes $300 in revenues in its financial statements for each quarter of 2009 for a total of $1,200 in 2009. ABC recognizes the remaining $1,000 in revenues in its financial statements during 2010. For tax purposes, ABC recognizes $200 into revenue in 2008 and $2,200 into revenue in 2009 under Rev.

On December 20, 2008, ABC files a Form 3115 requesting permission to change its method of accounting. The requested change results in a negative section

481(a) adjustment of $80,000. ABC subsequently receives the consent of the Commissioner to make the change and therefore, the negative $80,000 section 481(a) adjustment is properly recognized in ABC's tax return for the year ending December 31, 2008. Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section ABC is permitted to recognize the negative $80,000 section 481(a) adjustment as an extraordinary item occurring on January 1, 2008 (the first day of ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year), or December 20, 2008 (the date ABC filed the Form 3115). ABC chooses to recognize the negative $80,000 section 481(a) adjustment as an extraordinary item occurring in January 1, 2008. Accordingly, $80,000 of the negative section 481(a) adjustment is taken into account after annualization for purposes of determining ABC's first annualized income installment. In addition, under Sec. 1.6655-6(b), ABC is required to use its new method of accounting as of January 1, 2008 for estimated tax purposes, consistent with the recognition of the section 481(a) adjustment for estimated tax purposes.

Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and uses the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. On June 15, 2008, ABC files a Form 3115 requesting permission to change its method of accounting. The requested change results in a positive section 481(a) adjustment of $240,000. ABC subsequently receives the consent of the Commissioner to make the change and therefore, $60,000 of the section 481(a) adjustment (one quarter of the positive $240,000 section 481(a) adjustment) is properly recognized in ABC's tax return for the year ending December 31, 2008. Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, ABC is permitted to recognize the positive $60,000 section 481(a) adjustment as an extraordinary item occurring on January 1, 2008 (the first day of ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year), or June 15, 2008 (the date ABC filed the Form 3115). ABC chooses to recognize the positive $60,000 section 481(a) adjustment as an extraordinary item occurring on June 15, 2008.

Therefore, ABC will be required to use the new method of accounting (as of the beginning of the tax year) for purposes of determining taxable income to be annualized in computing ABC's third and fourth annualized income installments (which are based upon annualization periods that include June 15, 2008.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 12.

On May 10, 2008, ABC reaches a settlement agreement with XYZ over a tort action filed by ABC. As a result, ABC receives a payment of $10,000,000 on June 15, 2006, that is recognized as income by ABC. The settlement of a tort action is an extraordinary item defined in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the $10,000,000 of income will be taken into account by ABC on May 10, 2008, for purposes of computing ABC's annualized income installments for 2008. Therefore, the $10,000,000 settlement will only be taken into account in computing ABC's third and fourth annualized income installments (which are based upon annualization periods that include May 10, 2008).

ABC projects its annualized tax for its 2008 taxable year, based on annualizing ABC's taxable income for its first annualization period from January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, to be $2,000,000 before reduction for any credits. ABC has historically earned a section 41 credit for increasing research activities and, for 2008, ABC estimates that it will earn a credit for increasing research activities under section 41 of $1,200,000. However, pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, if ABC were to annualize all components involved in computing the current year credit based on ABC's activity from January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, ABC would generate a credit of $1,600,000 for 2008. For purposes of determining ABC's first annualized income installment, ABC's annualized tax for 2008 is $400,000, determined as the tax for the 2008 taxable year ($2,000,000) computed by placing on an annualized basis ABC's taxable income from its first annualization period January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, reduced by a $1,600,000 current year section 41 credit from increasing research activities.

Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, ABC cannot take into account any credit for its first annualization period because ABC did not incur any qualified research expenses by the last day of the first annualization period. Accordingly, for purposes of determining ABC's first annualized income installment, ABC's annualized tax for its first annualization period January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, is $2,000,000.

On January 2, 2007, ABC purchased and placed in service a tangible depreciable asset that costs $50,000 and is 5-year property under section 168(e). ABC depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2007 under the general depreciation system using the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half year convention. On January 2, 2008, ABC purchased and placed in service qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property (GO Zone property) that costs $30,000 and is 5-year property under section 168(e). ABC will depreciate its 5-year property placed in service in 2008 under the general depreciation system using the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. ABC will deduct the 50% additional first year depreciation deduction under section 1400N(d) with respect to the GO Zone property. For tax year 2007, ABC takes a depreciation deduction under section 168 of $10,000 ($50,000 x 20% = $10,000).

During its first annualization period from January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008, ABC incurs W-2 wages allocable to domestic production gross receipts pursuant to section 199(b)(2) of $10,000. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, ABC is permitted to take into account its estimated section 199 deduction before annualizing taxable income based on the lesser of its estimated QPAI or taxable income and W-2 wages for its first installment period for 2008. For the first installment period in 2008, ABC is permitted to recognize a deduction under section 199 of $3,000 ($50,000 x .06 = $3,000) subject to the wage limitation of $5,000 (50 percent of $10,000 of W-2 wages incurred during the first installment period). Accordingly, ABC's annualized income for the first installment for 2008 is $188,000 (($50,000-$3,000) x 1\2/3\ = $188,000).

Thus, the corporation must determine its annualized taxable income under section 6655(d)(3)(A) (ii) or (iii), whichever is applicable, and compute the resulting tax. The resulting tax shall include the alternative minimum tax under section 55 and the environmental tax under section 59A and may take credits into account to the extent permitted under section 6655(d)(3). The sum of this subsequent

installment payment and the earlier installment payment or payments of the corporation must equal or exceed the applicable percentage of the tax so computed. In determining whether the corporation has satisfied the requirements of section 6655(d)(3)(A) (ii) or (iii) with respect to the subsequent installment, the safe harbor provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Installment payments equal to applicable percentage of tax shown on return. The subsequent installment payment of a corporation satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) if the sum of that payment and the earlier installment payment or payments of the corporation equals or exceeds the applicable percentage of the tax shown on the return of the corporation for the taxable year to which the installment payments relate. The tax shown on the return includes all taxes specified in section 6655(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consequence of corporation's failure to satisfy requirements for subsequent installment--(i) In general.

If a corporation fails to satisfy the requirements set out in this paragraph (c), the corporation shall lose the benefit of the safe harbor provided by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limit on penalty. The aggregate underpayment penalty with respect to any installment payment or payments for which a corporation loses the benefit of the safe harbor under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section shall be limited to the ``shortfall penalty amount.'' The shortfall penalty amount is the penalty that would be imposed under section 6655(a) if there were an underpayment of the subsequent installment payment equal to the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount required to be paid, as determined under this paragraph (c), on or before the due date of the subsequent installment payment, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount actually paid on or before such date with respect to the subsequent installment payment.

For purposes of this determination, the period of the underpayment shall run from the due date of the subsequent installment payment until the earlier of the dates specified in section 6655(c) (1) or (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(5) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation M, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, relies on the safe harbor provided by paragraph (b) of this section for its first two installment payments of estimated tax for 1987. M is required by this paragraph (c) to make a timely subsequent installment payment of $1,000,000 by September 15, 1987, but M's actual installment payment by that date is only $990,000. Because of this shortfall, M loses the benefit of the safe harbor and is subject to underpayment penalties with respect to the first two installments. The aggregate penalties with respect to those two installments, however, cannot exceed the amount of the underpayment penalty to which M would be subject if there were an underpayment of $10,000 with respect to the September 15, 1987, installment payment. Such penalties are independent of any penalty that may apply with respect to M's third installment payment under the normal rules of section 6655.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X (which is not a life insurance company) uses as its taxable year a fiscal year ending on January 31 and is required to pay an installment of estimated income tax by May 15, 1987, for its taxable year beginning on February 1, 1987. On its return for the taxable year ending January 31, 1987, which was a year of 12 months, X reported taxable income of $10,000,000 ($9,000,000 of which was ordinary income and $1,000,000 of which was net capital gain) and did not claim any net operating loss deduction. As of February 1, 1987, X has no net operating loss carryforwards and no credit carryforwards. X has no credits against tax that are permitted to be taken into account under section 6655(d)(3) for 1987. If X uses the safe harbor provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, X must make by May 15, 1987, an installment payment of estimated tax of at least $1,037,836, computed as follows:
(1) Taxable income shown on return for taxable year          $10,000,000</p><p class="depth0">ending on January 31, 1987............................(2) Annualized taxable income for taxable year ending        $12,000,000</p><p class="depth0">January 31, 1988, determined pursuant to paragraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section (Item (1)x120%)................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section (Item (1)x120%)................</p><p class="depth0">(Note: 120%xordinary income of $9,000,000=$10,800,000;120%xnet capital gain of $1,000,000=$1,200,000)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tax on annualized taxable income (Item 2) using           $4,612,603</p><p class="depth0">rates under section 11 and 1201, taking into account</p><p class="depth0">section 15, applicable to the taxable year ending</p><p class="depth0">January 31, 1988......................................(4) Amount described in section 6655(d)(3)(A)(i) (Item        $1,037,836</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)x22.5%)</em>............................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To preclude imposition of an addition to tax under section 6655 with respect to its May 15, 1987, installment payment, X must make by July 15, 1987, a second installment payment of estimated tax sufficient to bring its aggregate payments to the minimum level required under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> X may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section by making a second installment payment sufficient to bring X within the exception provided in section 6655(d)(3). Thus, if X determines under that section that the aggregate of X's installment payments of estimated tax by July 15, 1987, must equal at least $3,000,000, X may obtain the benefit of the safe harbor provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the May 15, 1987, installment payment by making a timely second installment payment of $1,962,164 ($3,000,000--$1,037,836).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Even if X fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X may obtain the benefit of the safe harbor for the May 15, 1987, installment payment if X's second installment payment, when aggregated with the first payment, equals at least 45 percent of the tax (including the alternative minimum tax under section 55 and the environmental tax under section 59A) shown on X's return for X's taxable year beginning on February 1, 1987. Thus, if the tax shown on that return is $6,000,000, X's second installment payment under paragraph (c)(4) of this section must be at least $1,662,164, computed as follows:
45 percent of $6,000,000...............................       $2,700,000</p><p class="depth0">less first payment.................................        1,037,836</p><p class="depth0">----------------Minimum second installment.............................       $1,662,164</p><p class="depth0">[T.D. 8132, 52 FR 10051, Mar. 30, 1987]</p>
