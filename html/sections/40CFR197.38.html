                            <p class="depth0">Yes. The individual protection and ground water protection standards  are severable.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 197--Calculation of Annual Committed Effective</p><p class="depth0">Dose Equivalent</p><p class="depth0">Unless otherwise directed by NRC, DOE shall use the radiation  weighting factors and tissue weighting factors in this Appendix to  calculate the internal component of the annual committed effective dose  equivalent for compliance with Sec. Sec. 197.20 and 197.25 of this  part. NRC may allow DOE to use updated factors issued after the  effective date of this regulation. Any such factors shall have been  issued by consensus scientific organizations and incorporated by EPA  into Federal radiation guidance in order to be considered generally  accepted and eligible for this use. Further, they must be compatible  with the effective dose equivalent dose calculation methodology  established in ICRP 26 and 30, and continued in ICRP 60 and 72, and  incorporated in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">I. Equivalent Dose</p><p class="depth0">The calculation of the committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE)  begins with the determination of the equivalent dose, HT, to  a tissue or organ, T, listed in Table A.2 below by using the equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC08.000  where DT,R is the absorbed dose in rads (one gray, an SI  unit, equals 100 rads) averaged over the tissue or organ, T, due to  radiation type, R, and wR is the radiation weighting factor  which is given in Table A.1 below. The unit of equivalent dose is the  rem (sievert, in SI units).</p><p class="depth0">Table A.1--Radiation weighting factors, wR\1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Radiation type and energy range \2\                wR value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Photons, all energies......................................            1 Electrons and muons, all energies..........................            1 Neutrons, energy</p><p class="depth0"><10 keV................................................            5</p><p class="depth0">10 keV to 100 keV......................................           10</p><p class="depth0">100 keV to 2 MeV............................           20</p><p class="depth0">2 MeV to 20 MeV.............................           10</p><p class="depth0">20 MeV......................................            5 Protons, other than recoil protons, 2 MeV.......            5 Alpha particles, fission fragments, heavy nuclei...........          20 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ All values relate to the radiation incident on the body or, for</p><p class="depth0">internal sources, emitted from the source. \2\ See paragraph A14 in ICRP Publication 60 for the choice of values</p><p class="depth0">for other radiation types and energies not in the table.</p><p class="depth0">II. Effective Dose Equivalent</p><p class="depth0">The next step is the calculation of the effective dose equivalent,  E. The probability of occurrence of a stochastic effect in a tissue or  organ is assumed to be proportional to the equivalent dose in the tissue  or organ. The constant of proportionality differs for the various  tissues of the body, but in assessing health detriment the total risk is  required. This is taken into account using the tissue weighting factors,  wT in Table A.2, which represent the proportion of the  stochastic risk resulting from irradiation of the tissue or organ to the  total risk when the whole body is irradiated uniformly and HT  is the equivalent dose in the tissue or organ, T, in the equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC08.001</p><p class="depth0">Table A.2--Tissue weighting factors, wT ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Tissue or organ                          wT value ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gonads.....................................................         0.20 Bone marrow (red)..........................................         0.12 Colon......................................................         0.12 Lung.......................................................         0.12 Stomach....................................................         0.12</p><p class="depth0">Bladder....................................................         0.05 Breast.....................................................         0.05 Liver......................................................         0.05 Esophagus..................................................         0.05 Thyroid....................................................         0.05 Skin.......................................................         0.01 Bone surface...............................................         0.01 Remainder..................................................  \a b\ 0.05 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \a\ Remainder is composed of the following tissues: adrenals, brain,</p><p class="depth0">extrathoracic airways, small intestine, kidneys, muscle, pancreas,</p><p class="depth0">spleen, thymus, and uterus. \b\ The value 0.05 is applied to the mass-weighted average dose to the</p><p class="depth0">Remainder tissues group, except when the following ``splitting rule''</p><p class="depth0">applies: If a tissue of Remainder receives a dose in excess of that</p><p class="depth0">received by any of the 12 tissues for which weighting factors are</p><p class="depth0">specified, a weighting factor of 0.025 (half of Remainder) is applied</p><p class="depth0">to that tissue or organ and 0.025 to the mass-averaged committed</p><p class="depth0">equivalent dose equivalent in the rest of the Remainder tissues.</p><p class="depth0">III. Annual Committed Tissue or Organ Equivalent Dose</p><p class="depth0">For internal irradiation from incorporated radionuclides, the total  absorbed dose will be spread out in time, being gradually delivered as  the radionuclide decays. The time distribution of the absorbed dose rate  will vary with the radionuclide, its form, the mode of intake and the  tissue within which it is incorporated. To take account of this  distribution the quantity committed equivalent dose,  HT([tau]) where [tau] is the integration time in years  following an intake over any particular year, is used and is the  integral over time of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or  organ that will be received by an individual following an intake of  radioactive material into the body: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC08.002  for a single intake of activity at time t0 where  HT([tau]) is the relevant equivalent-dose rate in a tissue or  organ at time t. For the purposes of this rule, the previously mentioned  single intake may be considered to be an annual intake.  IV. Internal Component of the Annual Committed Effective Dose Equivalent</p><p class="depth0">If the annual committed equivalent doses to the individual tissues  or organs resulting from an annual intake are multiplied by the  appropriate weighting factors, wT, from table A.2, and then  summed, the result will be the internal component of the annual  committed effective dose equivalent E([tau]): [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC08.003   [73 FR 61288, Oct. 15, 2008]</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER G_NOISE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS</p>
