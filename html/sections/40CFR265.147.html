The request for a variance must be submitted in  writing to the Regional Administrator. If granted, the variance will  take the form of an adjusted level of required liability coverage, such  level to be based on the Regional Administrator's assessment of the  degree and duration of risk associated with the ownership or operation  of the facility or group of facilities. The Regional Administrator may  require an owner or operator who requests a variance to provide such  technical and engineering information as is deemed necessary by the  Regional Administrator to determine a level of financial responsibility  other than that required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The  Regional Administrator will process a variance request as if it were a  permit modification request under Sec. 270.41(a)(5) of this chapter and  subject to the procedures of Sec. 124.5 of this chapter.

This adjusted level will be  based on the Regional Administrator's assessment of the degree and  duration of risk associated with the ownership or operation of the  facility or group of facilities. In addition, if the Regional  Administrator determines that there is a significant risk to human  health and the environment from nonsudden accidental occurrences  resulting from the operations of a facility that is not a surface  impoundment, landfill, or land treatment facility, he may require that  an owner or operator of the facility comply with paragraph (b) of this  section. An owner or operator must furnish to the Regional  Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information which the  Regional Administrator requests to determine whether cause exists for  such adjustments of level or type of coverage. The Regional  Administrator will process an adjustment of the level of required  coverage as if it were a permit modification under Sec. 270.41(a)(5) of  this chapter and subject to the procedures of Sec. 124.5 of this  chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision, the Regional Administrator  may hold a public hearing at his discretion or whenever he finds, on the  basis of requests for a public hearing, a significant degree of public  interest in a tentative decision to adjust the level or type of required  coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Period of coverage.

An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause  for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other  qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must  provide evidence of insurance for the entire amount of required  liability coverage as specified in this section within 30 days after  notification of disallowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(2)</em> of this section, an owner or operator may meet the requirements  of this section by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred  to as ``guarantee.''

One of these items must be the  letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's  parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or  operator, this letter must describe the value received in consideration  of the guarantee.

For  purposes of this paragraph, ``the full amount of the liability coverage  to be provided'' means the amount of coverage for sudden and/or  nonsudden occurrences required to be provided by the owner or operator  by this section, less the amount of financial assurance for liability  coverage that is being pro vided by other financial assurance mechanisms  being used to de mon strate financial assurance by the owner or  operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The wording of the trust fund must be identical to the wording  specified in Sec. 264.151(m) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an owner or  operator using liability insurance to satisfy the   requirements of this section may use, until October 16, 1982, a  Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or Certificate of  Liability Insurance that does not certify that the insurer is licensed  to transact the business of insurance, or eligible as an excess or  surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.
