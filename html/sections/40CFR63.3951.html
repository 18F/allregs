                                Sec. 63.3951  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must meet the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3890, but is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards in Sec. Sec. 63.3892 and 63.3893, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each general use, magnet wire, rubber-to-

metal, and extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operation unless you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in Sec. 63.3890(c). If you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in Sec. 63.3890(c), you must demonstrate that all coating operations included in the predominant activity determination or calculation of the facility-specific emission limit comply with that limit. You must meet all the requirements of this section. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed on-site (or reclaimed off-site if you have documentation showing that you received back the exact same materials that were sent off-site) and reused in the coating operation for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option. If you use coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed on-site, the amount of each used in a month may be reduced by the amount of each that is reclaimed. That is, the amount used may be calculated as the amount consumed to account for materials that are reclaimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material. Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month according to the requirements in Sec. 63.3941(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the volume fraction of coating solids. Determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liter (gal) of coating solids per liter (gal) of coating) for each coating used during each month according to the requirements in Sec. 63.3941(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine the density of each material. Determine the density of each liquid coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month from test results using ASTM Method D1475-98, ``Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If you are including powder coatings in the compliance determination, determine the density of powder coatings, using ASTM Method D5965-02, ``Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity of Coating Powders'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), or information from the supplier. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-98 or ASTM Method D5965-02 test results and other such information sources, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct. If you purchase materials or monitor consumption by weight instead of volume, you do not need to determine material density. Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, 1C, and 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determine the volume of each material used. Determine the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month by measurement or usage records. If you purchase materials or monitor consumption by weight instead of volume, you do not need to determine the volume of each material used. Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, and 1C of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions. The mass of organic HAP emissions is the combined mass of organic HAP contained in all coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used during each month minus the organic HAP in certain waste materials. Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions using Equation 1 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA04.005

The TSDF may be either off-site or on-site. You may not include organic HAP contained in wastewater.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> You must determine either the amount of the waste materials sent to a TSDF during the month or the amount collected and stored during the month and designated for future transport to a TSDF. Do not include in your determination any waste materials sent to a TSDF during a month if you have already included them in the amount collected and stored during that month or a previous month.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the total mass of organic HAP contained in the waste materials specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iv)</em> You must document the methodology you use to determine the amount of waste materials and the total mass of organic HAP they contain, as required in Sec. 63.3930(h).

You must keep all records as required by Sec. Sec. 63.3930 and 63.3931. As part of the notification of compliance status required by Sec. 63.3910, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.3890, determined according to the procedures in this section.</p>
