The resulting stock holding company may not hold  this meeting until six months after the conversion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> When the resulting stock holding company distributes proxies  or related material to shareholders in connection with the vote on a  plan, the resulting stock holding company states that the plan complies  with Board regulations and that the Board does not endorse or approve  the plan in any way. The resulting stock holding company may not make  any written or oral representations to the contrary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The resulting stock holding company does not grant stock  options at less than the market price at the time of grant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The resulting stock holding company does not fund the Option  Plan or the MRP at the time of the conversion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> The plan does not begin to vest earlier than one year after  shareholders approve the plan, and does not vest at a rate exceeding 20  percent per year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> The plan permits accelerated vesting only for disability or  death, or if the resulting stock holding company undergoes a change of  control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> The plan provides that the executive officers or directors  must exercise or forfeit their options in the event the institution  becomes critically undercapitalized under the applicable regulatory  capital requirements, is subject to Board enforcement action, or  receives a capital directive under Sec. 263.83 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> The resulting stock holding company files a copy of the  proposed Option Plan or MRP with the Board and certifies to the Board  that the plan approved by the shareholders is the same plan that the  resulting stock holding company filed with, and disclosed in, the proxy  materials distributed to shareholders in connection with the vote on the  plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> The resulting stock holding company files the plan and the  certification with the Board within five calendar days after the  shareholders approve the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting stock holding company may provide dividend  equivalent rights or dividend adjustment rights to allow for stock  splits or other adjustments to the stock in the ESOP, MRP, and Option  Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The restrictions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not  apply to plans implemented more than 12 months after the conversion,  provided that materials pertaining to any shareholder vote regarding  such plans are not distributed within the 12 months after the  conversion. If a plan adopted in conformity with paragraph (a)(1) of  this section is amended more than 12 months following the conversion,  the shareholders must ratify any material deviations to the requirements  in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions on the sale of conversion shares by directors,  officers, and their associates. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directors and officers who purchase  conversion shares may not sell the shares for one year after the date of  purchase, except that in the event of the death of the officer or  director, the successor in interest may sell the shares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting stock holding company must include notice of the  restriction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section on each  certificate of stock that a director or officer purchases during the  conversion or receives in connection with a stock dividend, stock split,  or otherwise with respect to such restricted shares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The resulting stock holding company must instruct the stock  transfer agent about the transfer restrictions in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For three years after the resulting stock holding company  converts, the officers, directors, and their associates may purchase  stock of the resulting stock holding company only from a broker or  dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The resulting stock holding company must comply with the capital  distribution requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The restrictions on share repurchases apply to a charitable  organization under Sec. 239.64(b).

(1) To  repurchase stock in the first year following conversion, other than  repurchases under paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) or (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section,  the resulting stock holding company must file a written notice with the  appropriate Reserve Bank. The resulting stock holding company must  provide the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The proposed repurchase program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of the repurchases on the regulatory capital and  other capital levels; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The purpose of the repurchases and, if applicable, an  explanation of the extraordinary circumstances necessitating the  repurchases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting stock holding company must file the notice with  the appropriate Reserve Bank at least thirty days before the resulting  stock holding company begins the repurchase program. The Board may  extend its review of the notice for an additional sixty days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The resulting stock holding company may not repurchase the  shares if the Board objects to the repurchase program. The Board will  not object to the repurchase program if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The repurchase program will not adversely affect the financial  condition of the resulting savings association;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The resulting stock holding company submits sufficient  information to evaluate the proposed repurchases;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The resulting stock holding company demonstrate extraordinary  circumstances and a compelling and valid business purpose for the share  repurchases; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The repurchase program would not be contrary to other  applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Declaring and paying dividends following conversion. The  resulting stock holding company may declare or pay a dividend on its  shares after it converts if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dividend will not reduce the regulatory capital below the  amount required for the liquidation account under Sec. 239.62(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The resulting stock holding company complies with all applicable  regulatory capital requirements after it declares or pays dividends;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The resulting stock holding company complies with the capital  distribution requirements under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The resulting stock holding company does not return any capital,  other than ordinary dividends, to purchasers during the term of the  business plan submitted with the conversion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eligibility to acquire shares after conversion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For three  years after the resulting stock holding company converts, no person may,  directly or indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire the beneficial  ownership of more than ten percent of any class of the equity securities  without the Board's prior written approval. If a person violates this  prohibition, the resulting stock holding company may not permit the  person to vote shares in excess of ten percent, and may not count the  shares in excess of ten percent in any shareholder vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person acquires beneficial ownership of more than ten percent  of a class of shares when he or she holds any combination of the stock  or revocable or irrevocable proxies under circumstances that give rise  to a conclusive control determination or rebuttable control  determination under Sec. Sec. 238.21(a) and (d) of this chapter. The  Board will presume that a person has acquired shares if the acquiror  entered into a binding written agreement for the transfer of shares. For  purposes of this section, an offer is made when it is communicated. An  offer does not include non-binding expressions of understanding or  letters of intent regarding the terms of a potential acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the restrictions in this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section do not apply to any  offer with a view toward public resale made exclusively to the resulting  stock holding company, to the underwriters, or to a selling group acting  on behalf of the resulting savings association.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unless the Board objects in writing, any person may offer or  announce an offer to acquire up to one percent of any class of shares.  In computing the one percent limit, the person must include all of his  or her acquisitions of   the same class of shares during the prior 12 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A corporation whose ownership is, or will be, substantially  the same as the ownership may acquire or offer to acquire more than ten  percent of the common stock, if it makes the offer or acquisition more  than one year after the resulting stock holding company converts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> One or more of the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans  may acquire the shares, if the plan or plans do not beneficially own  more than 25 percent of any class of shares of the resulting savings  association in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An acquiror does not have to file a separate application to  obtain Board approval under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, if the  acquiror files an application under part 238 of this chapter that  specifically addresses the criteria listed under paragraph (f)(4) of  this section and the resulting stock holding company does not oppose the  proposed acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Board may deny an application under paragraph (f)(1) of this  section if the proposed acquisition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is contrary to the purposes of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is manipulative or deceptive;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subverts the fairness of the conversion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is likely to injure the resulting stock holding company;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Is inconsistent with the plan to meet the credit and lending  needs of the proposed market area;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Otherwise violates laws or regulations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Does not prudently deploy the conversion proceeds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional requirements that apply following conversion.
