The work to be performed under these orders must be within the  scope of the contract.

Charges for any work not authorized shall be  disallowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each task order under the contract, the Contracting Office  shall send a request for proposal to the contractor(s). The request will  contain a detailed description of the tasks to be achieved, a schedule  for completion of the task order, and deliverables to be provided by the  contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contractor shall submit a proposal defining the technical  approach to be taken to complete the task order, work schedule and  proposed cost/price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After any necessary negotiations, the contractor shall submit a  final proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Task orders will be considered fully executed upon signature of  the Contracting Officer.
