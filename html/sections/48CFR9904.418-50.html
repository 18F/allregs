                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of direct cost and indirect cost. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The business  unit's written policy classifying costs as direct or indirect shall be  in conformity with the requirements of this Standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accounting for direct costs a business unit shall use actual  costs, except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Standard costs for material and labor may be used as provided in  9904.407; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An average cost or pre-established rate for labor may be used  provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The functions performed are not materially disparate and  employees involved are interchangeable with respect to the functions  performed, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The functions performed are materially disparate but the  employees involved either all work in a single production unit yielding  homogeneous outputs, or perform their respective functions as an  integral team.  Whenever average cost or pre-established rates for labor are used, the   variances, if material, shall be disposed of at least annually by  allocation to cost objectives in proportion to the costs previously  allocated to these cost objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this subsection  shall be accounted for as direct labor or direct material costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Homogeneous indirect cost pools. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An indirect cost pool is  homogeneous if each significant activity whose costs are included  therein has the same or a similar beneficial or causal relationship to  cost objectives as the other activities whose costs are included in the  cost pool. It is also homogeneous if the allocation of the costs of the  activities included in the cost pool result in an allocation to cost  objectives which is not materially different from the allocation that  would result if the costs of the activities were allocated separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An indirect cost pool is not homogeneous if the costs of all  significant activities in the cost pool do not have the same or a  similar beneficial or causal relationship to cost objectives and, if the  costs were allocated separately, the resulting allocation would be  materially different. The determination of materiality shall be made  using the criteria provided in 9903.305.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A homogeneous indirect cost pool shall include all indirect  costs identified with the activity to which the pool relates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change in allocation base. No change in an existing indirect  cost pool allocation base is required if the allocation resulting from  the existing base does not differ materially from the allocation that  results from the use of the base determined to be most appropriate in  accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this  subsection. The determination of materiality shall be made using the  criteria provided in Subpart 9903.305.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation measures for an indirect cost pool which includes a  material amount of the costs of management or supervision of activities  involving direct labor or direct material costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs of the  management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or direct  material costs do not have a direct and definitive relationship to the  benefiting cost objectives and cannot be allocated on measures of a  specific beneficial or causal relationship. In that circumstance, the  base selected to measure the allocation of the pooled costs to cost  objectives shall be a base representative of the activity being managed  or supervised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The base used to represent the activity being managed or  supervised shall be determined by the application of the criteria below.  All significant elements of the selected base shall be included.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A direct labor hour base or direct labor cost base shall be  used, whichever in the aggregate is more likely to vary in proportion to  the costs included in the cost pool being allocated, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A machine-hour base is appropriate if the costs in the cost  pool are comprised predominantly of facility-related costs, such as  depreciation, maintenance, and utilities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A units-of-production base is appropriate if there is common  production of comparable units; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A material cost base is appropriate if the activity being  managed or supervised is a material-related activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indirect cost pools which include material amounts of the costs  of management or supervision of activities involving direct labor or  direct material costs shall be allocated to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Final cost objectives;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Goods produced for stock or product inventory;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Independent research and development and bid and proposal  projects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cost centers used to accumulate costs identified with a process  cost system (i.e., process cost centers);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Goods or services produced or acquired for other segments of the  contractor and for other cost objectives of a business unit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Self-construction, fabrication, betterment, improvement, or  installation of tangible capital assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Allocation measures for indirect cost pools that do not include  material amounts of the costs of management or supervision of activities  involving direct   labor or direct material costs. Homogeneous indirect cost pools of this  type have a direct and definitive relationship between the activities in  the pool and benefiting cost objectives. The pooled costs shall be  allocated using an appropriate measure of resource consumption. This  determination shall be made in accordance with the following criteria  taking into consideration the individual circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The best representation of the beneficial or causal relationship  between an indirect cost pool and the benefiting cost objectives is a  measure of resource consumption of the activities of the indirect cost  pool.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If consumption measures are unavailable or impractical to  ascertain, the next best representation of the beneficial or causal  relationship for allocation is a measure of the output of the activities  of the indirect cost pool. Thus, the output is substituted for a direct  measure of the consumption of resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of the basic unit of output will not reflect the  proportional consumption of resources in circumstances in which the  level of resource consumption varies among the units of output produced.  Where a material difference will result, either the output measure shall  be modified or more than one output measure shall be used to reflect the  resources consumed to perform the activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If neither resources consumed nor output of the activities can  be measured practically, a surrogate that varies in proportion to the  services received shall be used to measure the resources consumed.  Generally, such surrogates measure the activity of the cost objectives  receiving the service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of indirect cost pools which benefit one another may  be accomplished by use of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cross-allocation (reciprocal) method,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sequential method, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Another method the results of which approximate those achieved  by either of the methods in subdivisions (e)(4)(i) or (e)(4)(ii) of this  subsection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the activities represented by an indirect cost pool  provide services to two or more cost objectives simultaneously, the cost  of such services shall be prorated between or among the cost objectives  in reasonable proportion to the beneficial or causal relationship  between the services and the cost objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special allocation. Where a particular cost objective in  relation to other cost objectives receives significantly more or less  benefit from an indirect cost pool than would be reflected by the  allocation of such costs using a base determined pursuant to paragraphs  (d) and (e) of this subsection, the Government and contractor may agree  to a special allocation from that indirect cost pool to the particular  cost objective commensurate with the benefits received. The amount of a  special allocation to any such cost objective made pursuant to such an  agreement shall be excluded from the indirect cost pool and the  particular cost objective's allocation base data shall be excluded from  the base used to allocate the pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use of preestablished rates for indirect costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Preestablished rates, based on either forecasted actual or standard  cost, may be used in allocating an indirect cost pool.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preestablished rates shall reflect the costs and activities  anticipated for the cost accounting period except as provided in  paragraph (g)(3) of this subsection. Such preestablished rates shall be  reviewed at least annually, and revised as necessary to reflect the  anticipated conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contracting parties may agree on preestablished rates which  are not based on costs and activities anticipated for a cost accounting  period. The contractor shall have and consistently apply written  policies for the establishment of these rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Under paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this subsection where  variances of a cost accounting period are material, these variances  shall be disposed of by allocating them to cost objectives in proportion  to the costs previously allocated to these cost objectives by use of the  preestablished rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If preestablished rates are revised during a cost accounting  period and if the variances accumulated to the time of the revision are  significant, the costs allocated to that time shall be adjusted to the  amounts which would   have been allocated using the revised preestablished rates.</p>
