Subsequently, they will be tested  at 3,000 device-mile intervals, up to and including the final mileage  point of 15,000 device-miles. Testing at these mileage points will be  performed with the vehicle equipped with the full retrofit system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the 15,000-mile test the vehicle will be tuned as  necessary and the device adjusted to the manufacturer's specifications  as required. The fully restored retrofitted configuration will then be  tested. The device will then be removed from the vehicle and the vehicle  set to vehicle manufacturer's specifications. A tuned baseline test will  then be conducted.</p>
