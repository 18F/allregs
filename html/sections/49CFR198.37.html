However, an excavator must be allowed to begin an excavation activity in an emergency but, in doing so, required to notify the operational center at the earliest practicable moment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State must determine whether telephonic and other communications to the operational center of a one-call notification system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), operators of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in which those pipeline facilities are located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the manner prescribed by Sec. 192.614 (c)(4) through (c)(6) of this chapter to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational center of a one-call notification system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by Sec. 192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and use of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline facilities.
