The participant shall sell the donated commodities at a reasonable market price in the economy where the sale occurs. The participant shall use any sale proceeds, income, or goods or services derived from the sale or barter of the donated commodities only as provided in the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The participant shall deposit all sale proceeds and income into a separate, interest-bearing account unless the exceptions in Sec. 3019.22(k) of this title apply, the account is in a country where the laws or customs prohibit the payment of interest, or FAS determines that this requirement would constitute an undue burden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A participant may use sale proceeds or income to purchase real or personal property only if local law permits the participant to retain title to

such property. However, the participant shall not use sale proceeds or income to pay for the acquisition, development, construction, alteration or upgrade of real property that is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious pursuits; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes, except that a participant may use sale proceeds or income to pay for repairs to or rehabilitation of a structure located on such real property to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated commodities, but only if such structure is not used in whole or in part for any religious or sectarian purposes while the donated commodities are stored in it. If such use is not specifically provided for in the agreement, such use may only occur after receipt of written approval from FAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A participant shall endeavor to comply with Sec. Sec. 3019.41 through 3019.43 of this title when procuring goods and services and when engaging in construction work to implement the agreement. The participant shall also establish procedures to prevent fraud. As provided for in the agreement, the participant shall enter into a written contract with each provider of goods, services or construction work that requires the provider to maintain adequate records to account for all donated commodities or funds or both provided to the provider by the participant and to submit periodic reports to the participant. The participant shall submit a copy of the signed contracts to FAS.</p>
