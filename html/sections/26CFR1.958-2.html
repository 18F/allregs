                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> as modified by section 958(b) and this section shall apply to the  extent that the effect is to treat a United States person as a United  States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b), to treat a  person as a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), to  treat the stock of a domestic corporation as owned by a United States  shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation under section 956(b)(2),  or to treat a foreign corporation as a controlled foreign corporation  under section 957. The rules contained in this section also apply for  purposes of other provisions of the Code and regulations which make  express reference to section 958(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Members of family--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, an individual shall be considered as  owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> His spouse (other than a spouse who is legally separated from  the individual under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> His children, grandchildren, and parents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of adoption. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this  paragraph, a legally adopted child of an individual shall be treated as  a child of such individual by blood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock owned by nonresident alien individual. For purposes of  this paragraph, stock owned by a nonresident alien individual (other  than a foreign trust or foreign estate) shall not be considered as owned  by a United States citizen or a resident alien individual. However, this  limitation does not apply for purposes of determining whether the stock  of a domestic corporation is owned or considered as owned by a United  States shareholder under section 956(b)(2) and Sec. 1.956-2(b)(1)(viii).  See section 958(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Attribution from partnerships, estates, trusts, and  corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of  this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From partnerships and estates. Stock owned, directly or  indirectly, by or for a partnership or estate shall be considered as  owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From trusts--(a) To beneficiaries. Stock owned, directly or  indirectly, by or for a trust (other than an employees' trust described  in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a)) shall  be considered as owned by its beneficiaries in proportion to the  actuarial interest of such beneficiaries in such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> To owner. Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any  portion of a trust of which a person is considered the owner under  sections 671 to 679 (relating to grantors and others treated as  substantial owners) shall be considered as owned by such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From corporations. If 10 percent or more in value of the stock  in a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person,  such person shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or  indirectly, by or for such corporation, in that proportion which the  value of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all  the stock in such corporation. See section 958(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Attribution to partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporations-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To partnerships and estates. Stock owned, directly or  indirectly, by or for a partner or a beneficiary of an estate shall be  considered as owned by the partnership or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To trusts--(a) From beneficiaries. Stock owned, directly or  indirectly, by or for a beneficiary of a trust (other than an employees'  trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section  501(a)) shall be considered as owned by the trust, unless such  beneficiary's interest in the trust is a remote contingent interest. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, a contingent interest of a  beneficiary in a trust shall be considered remote if, under the maximum  exercise of discretion by the trustee in favor of such beneficiary, the  value of such interest, computed actuarially, is 5 percent or less of  the value of the trust property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> From owner. Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a  person who is considered the owner of any portion of a trust under  sections 671 to 678 (relating to grantors and others treated as  substantial owners) shall be considered as owned by the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To corporations. If 50 percent or more in value of the stock  in a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person,  such corporation shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly  or indirectly, by or for such person. This subdivision shall not be  applied so as to consider a corporation as owning its own stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and Sec. 1.956-2(b)(1)(viii). See  section 958(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Options. If any person has an option to acquire stock, such  stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of the  preceding sentence, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of  a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire  such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rules of application. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stock treated as actually owned--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  provided in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, stock  constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of  paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall, for purposes of  applying such paragraphs, be considered as actually owned by such  person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Members of family. Stock constructively owned by an individual  by reason of the application of paragraph (b) of this section shall not  be considered as owned by him for purposes of again applying such  paragraph in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporation. Stock  constructively owned by a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation by  reason of the application of paragraph (d) of this section shall not be  considered as owned by it for purposes of applying paragraph (c) of this  section in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Option rule in lieu of family rule. For purposes of this  subparagraph, if stock may be considered as owned by an individual under  paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, it shall be considered as owned by  him under paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coordination of different attribution rules. For purposes of any  one determination, stock which may be owned under more than one of the  rules of Sec. 1.958-1 and this section, or by more than one person,  shall be owned under that attribution rule which imputes to the person,  or persons, concerned the largest total percentage of such stock. The  application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> United States persons A and B, and domestic  corporation M, own 9 percent, 32 percent, and 10 percent, respectively,  of the one class of stock in foreign corporation R. A also owns 10  percent of the one class of stock in M Corporation. For purposes of  determining whether A is a United States shareholder with respect to R  Corporation, 10 percent of the 10-percent interest of M Corporation in R  Corporation is considered as owned by A. See paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of  this section. Thus, A owns 10 percent (9 percent plus 10 percent of 10  percent) of the stock in R Corporation and is a United States  shareholder with respect to such corporation. Corporation M and B, by  reason of owning 10 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of the stock  in R Corporation are United States shareholders with respect to such  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of determining whether R Corporation is a  controlled foreign corporation, the 1 percent of the stock in R  Corporation directly owned by M Corporation and considered as owned by A  cannot be counted twice. Therefore, the total amount of stock in R  Corporation owned by United States shareholders is 51 percent,  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Stock Ownership in R Corporation</p><p class="depth0">[percent] A..............................................................        9 B..............................................................       32 M Corporation..................................................       10</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total........................................................       51</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. United States person C owns 10 percent of the one class  of stock in foreign corporation N, which owns 60 percent of the one  class of stock in foreign corporation S. Under paragraph (a)(2) of  Sec. 1.958-1, C is considered as owning 6 percent (10 percent of 60  percent) of the stock in S Corporation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) and  (2) of this section N Corporation is considered as owning 100 percent of  the stock in S Corporation and C is considered as owning 10 percent of  such 100 percent, or 10 percent of the stock in S Corporation. Thus, for  purposes of determining whether C is a United States shareholder with  respect to S Corporation, the attribution rules of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)  and (2) of this section are used inasmuch as C owns a larger total  percentage of the stock of S Corporation under such rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Illustration. The application of this section may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. United States persons A and B own 5 percent and 25  percent, respectively, of the one class of stock in foreign corporation  M. Corporation M owns 60 percent of the one class of stock in foreign  corporation N. Under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1, A and B are  considered as owning 3 percent (5 percent of 60 percent) and 15 percent  (25 percent of 60 percent), respectively, of the stock in N Corporation.  Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, M Corporation is treated as  owning all the stock in N Corporation, and, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)  of this section, B is considered as owning 25 percent of such 100  percent, or 25 percent of the stock in N Corporation. Inasmuch as A owns  less than 10 percent of the stock in M Corporation, he is not considered  as owning, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, any of the stock  in N Corporation owned by M Corporation. Thus, the attribution rules of  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1 are used with respect to A inasmuch as  he owns a larger total percentage of the stock of N Corporation under  such rules; and the attribution rules of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) and (2)  of this section are used with respect to B inasmuch as he owns a larger  total percentage of the stock of N Corporation under such rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. United States person C owns 60 percent of the one class  of stock in domestic corporation P; corporation P owns 60 percent of the  one class of stock in foreign corporation Q; and corporation Q owns 60  percent of the one class of stock in foreign corporation R. Under  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1, P Corporation is considered as owning  36 percent (60 percent of 60 percent) of the stock in R Corporation, and  C is considered as owning none of the stock in R Corporation inasmuch as  the chain of ownership stops at the first United States person and P  Corporation is such a person. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Q  Corporation is treated as owning 100 percent of the stock in R  Corporation, and under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, P  Corporation is considered as owning 60 percent of such 100 percent, or  60 percent of the stock in R Corporation. For purposes of determining  the amount of stock in R Corporation which C is considered as owning, P  Corporation is treated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section as owning  100 percent of the stock in R Corporation; therefore, C is considered as  owning 60 percent of the stock in R Corporation. Thus, the attribution  rules of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) and (2) of this section are used with  respect to C and P Corporation   inasmuch as they each own a larger total percentage of the stock of R  Corporation under such rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. United States person D owns 25 percent of the one class  of stock in foreign corporation S. D is also a 40-percent partner in  domestic partnership X, which owns 50 percent of the one class of stock  in domestic corporation T. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section,  the 25 percent of the stock in S Corporation owned by D is considered as  being owned by partnership X; since such stock is treated as actually  owned by partnership X under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, such  stock is in turn considered as being owned by T Corporation under  paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. Thus, under paragraphs (d)(1) and  (f)(1)(i) of this section, T Corporation is considered as owning 25  percent of the stock in S Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Foreign corporation U owns 100 percent of the one class  of stock in domestic corporation V and also 100 percent of the one class  of stock in foreign corporation W. By virtue of paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, V Corporation may not be considered under paragraph (d)(1) of  this section as owning the stock owned by its sole shareholder, U  Corporation, in W Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. United States citizen E owns 15 percent of the one class  of stock in foreign corporation Y, and United States citizen F, E's  spouse, owns 5 percent of such stock. E and F's four nonresident alien  grandchildren each own 20 percent of the stock in Y Corporation. Under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, E is considered as owning the stock  owned by F in Y Corporation; however, by virtue of paragraph (b)(3) of  this section, E may not be considered under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section as owning any of the stock in Y Corporation owned by such  grandchildren.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. United States person F owns 10 percent of the one class  of stock in foreign corporation Z; corporation Z owns 10 percent of the  one class of stock in foreign corporation K; and corporation K owns 100  percent of the one class of stock in foreign corporation L. United  States person G, F's spouse, owns 9 percent of the stock in K  Corporation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section or paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1, F is considered as owning 1 percent (10 percent  of 10 percent of 100 percent) of the stock in L Corporation by reason of  his ownership of stock in Z Corporation, and, under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, G is considered as owning such 1 percent of the stock in L  Corporation. Under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1, G is considered as  owning 9 percent (9 percent of 100 percent) of the stock in L  Corporation by reason of her ownership of stock in K Corporation, and,  under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, F is considered as owning such 9  percent of the stock in L Corporation. Thus, for the purpose of  determining whether F or G is a United States shareholder with respect  to L Corporation, each of F and G is considered as owning a total of 10  percent of the stock in L Corporation by applying the rules of paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec. 1.958-1 and paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(iii) of this  section.
