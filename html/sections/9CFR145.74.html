                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> U.S. Avian Influenza Clean Compartment. This program is intended  to be the basis from which the primary egg-type chicken breeding- hatchery industry may demonstrate the existence and implementation of a  program that has been approved by the Official State Agency and the  Service to establish a compartment consisting of a primary breeding- hatchery company that is free of H5/H7 avian influenza (AI), also  referred to as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). This compartment has  the purpose of protecting the defined subpopulation and avoiding the  introduction and spread of NAI within that subpopulation by prohibiting  contact with other commercial poultry operations, other domestic and  wild birds, and other intensive animal operations. The program shall  consist of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of the compartment. Based on the guidelines  established by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in the  Terrestrial Animal   Health Code and the guidelines in this paragraph (a), the primary  breeder company will define the compartment with respect to NAI.  Specifically, the company will use a comprehensive biosecurity program  to define the compartment as a subpopulation of poultry with a health  status for NAI that is separate from birds and poultry outside the  compartment. The Official State Agency and the Service must first  approve all documentation submitted by the company to substantiate the  defined compartment as adequate to qualify for epidemiological  separation from other potential sources of infection of NAI. Guidelines  for the definition of the compartment include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition and description of the subpopulation of birds and  their health status. All birds included in the compartment must be U.S.  Avian Influenza Clean in accordance with Sec. 145.73(f). The poultry  must also be located in a State that has an initial State response and  containment plan approved by APHIS under Sec. 56.10 of this chapter and  that participates in the diagnostic surveillance program for H5/H7 low  pathogenicity AI as described in Sec. 145.15. Within the compartment,  all official tests for AI, as described in Sec. 145.14(d), must be  conducted in State or Federal laboratories or in NPIP authorized  laboratories that meet the minimum standards described in Sec. 147.52  of this subchapter. In addition, the company must provide to the Service  upon request any relevant historical and current NAI-related data for  reference regarding surveillance for the disease within the compartment.  Upon request, the Official State Agency may provide such data for other  commercial poultry populations located in the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Description of animal identification and traceability  processes. The primary breeder company must also include a description  of its animal identification and traceability records, including  examples of Veterinary Services (VS) Form 9-5, ``Report of Hatcheries,  Dealers and Independent Flocks''; VS Form 9-2, ``Flock Selection and  Testing Report''; VS Form 9-3, ``Report of Sales of Hatching Eggs,  Chicks and Poults''; VS Form 9-9, '' Hatchery Inspection Report''; set  and hatch records; egg receipts; and egg/chick invoices for the  subpopulation. Documentation must also include breed identification  (NPIP stock code). The Service should ensure that an effective flock  identification system and traceability system are in place.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Definition and description of the physical components or  establishments of the defined compartment. The primary breeder company  must provide documentation establishing that the defined compartment is  epidemiologically separated from other poultry and bird populations. The  documentation must be approved by the Official State Agency and the  Service as indicating adequate epidemiological separation to maintain  the compartment's separate health status with respect to NAI. The  documentation should include descriptions of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The physical and spatial factors that separate the compartment  from surrounding bird populations and affect the biosecurity status of  the compartment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Relevant environmental factors that may affect exposure of the  birds to AI.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The functional boundary and fencing that are used to control  access to the compartment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Facilities and procedures to prevent access by wild birds and to  provide separation from other relevant hosts.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The relevant infrastructural factors that may affect exposure to  AI, including the construction and design of buildings or physical  components, cleaning and disinfection of buildings and physical  components between production groups with quality assurance  verification, cleaning and disinfection of equipment, and introduction  of equipment or material into the compartment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Definition and description of the functional relationships  between components of the defined compartment. Functional relationships  between components of the compartment include traffic movement and flow  at and among premises, personnel movement at and among premises,  exposure to live bird populations, and any other factors that could  affect biosecurity of the compartment. All physical components of the  compartment must be maintained   in compliance with hygiene and biosecurity procedures for poultry  primary breeding flocks and hatcheries in accordance with part 147 of  this subchapter. In addition, the company must provide a biosecurity  plan for the compartment and all included components. The biosecurity  plan should include but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Requirements that company employees and contract growers limit  their contact with live birds outside the compartment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An education and training program for company employees and  contractors.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Standard operating procedures for company employees,  contractors, and outside maintenance personnel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Requirements for company employees and non-company personnel who  visit any premises within the compartment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Company veterinary infrastructure to ensure flock monitoring and  disease diagnosis and control measures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Policies for management of vehicles and equipment used within  the compartment to connect the various premises.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Farm site requirements (location, layout, and construction).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Pest management program.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Cleaning and disinfection process.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Requirements for litter and dead bird removal and/or disposal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Description of other factors important for maintaining the  compartment. The company veterinary infrastructure will assess sanitary  measures, environmental risk factors, and management and husbandry  practices that relate to the separation of the compartment and the  health status of the birds contained within the compartment that may  affect risk of exposure to NAI. This assessment must include a  description of internal monitoring and auditing systems (e.g., quality  assurance and quality control programs) to demonstrate the effectiveness  of the compartment. Upon request, the Service will provide the company  with information on the epidemiology of NAI and the associated risk  pathways in which the components of the compartment are located.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Approval or denial. Based on the documentation provided under  this paragraph (a)(1), as well as any other information the Service and  the Official State Agency determine to be necessary, the Service and the  Official State Agency will approve or deny the classification of the  compartment as U.S. Avian Influenza Clean.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Company activities for maintenance of the compartment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The  primary breeder company's management of biosecurity, surveillance, and  disease control efforts must be uniform and equivalent among all  components that are a part of the compartment. Oversight and inspection  of these management practices must be conducted by the company's  licensed, accredited veterinarians.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Veterinary staff from the Official State Agency and NPIP staff  will work in partnership with licensed, accredited veterinarians to  train and certify auditors through Service-approved workshops. The  trained auditors will conduct biosecurity and operational audits at  least once every 2 years to ensure the integrity of the compartment.  These audits will include evaluation of the critical control points and  standard operating practices within the compartment, verification of the  health status of the flock(s) contained within the compartment, and  examination of the biosecurity and management system of the integrated  components of the compartment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In addition, the company must demonstrate compliance with  paragraph (a)(1) of this section for remaining in the U.S. Avian  Influenza Clean classification, surveillance for NAI within the  compartment, and conducting tests in State or Federal laboratories or in  NPIP authorized laboratories. Accredited veterinarians are responsible  for the enforcement of active and passive surveillance of NAI in primary  breeder flocks. Baseline health status must be maintained for all flocks  or subpopulations within the compartment, indicating the dates and  negative results of all avian influenza surveillance and monitoring  testing, the dates and history of last disease occurrence (if any), the  number of outbreaks, and the methods of disease control that were  applied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documentation will be maintained in the company's database and   will be verified as required by the Service and/or the Official State  Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service and Official State Agency activities for maintenance of  the compartment. The Service will work in cooperation with the Official  State Agencies to ensure the continued integrity of any recognized  compartments. Activities include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Oversight of the establishment and management of compartments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establishment of effective partnerships between the Service,  the Plan, and the primary breeder industry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Approval or denial of classification of compartments as U.S.  Avian Influenza Clean Compartments under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Official certification of the health status of the compartment,  and commodities that may be traded from it through participation in the  Plan for avian diseases, including the U.S. Avian Influenza Clean  program as described in Sec. 145.73(f) and diagnostic surveillance for  H5/H7 low pathogenicity AI as described in Sec. 145.15;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conducting audits of compartments at least once every 2 years  to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Confirm that the primary breeding company's establishments are  epidemiologically distinct and pathways for the introduction of disease  into the compartment are closed through routine operational procedures;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Evaluate and assess the management and husbandry practices  relating to biosecurity to determine whether they are in compliance with  hygiene and biosecurity procedures for poultry primary breeding flocks  and hatcheries in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Providing, upon request, model plans for management and  husbandry practices relating to biosecurity in accordance with part 147  of this subchapter, risk evaluations in conjunction with the primary  breeder industry (including disease surveillance such as VS Form 9-4,  ``Summary of Breeding Flock Participation''), and diagnostic capability  summaries and systems for initial State response and containment plans  in accordance with Sec. 56.10 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Publicizing and sharing compartment information with  international trading partners, upon request, to establish approval and  recognition of the compartment, including timeliness and accuracy of  disease reporting and surveillance measures as described in Sec. Sec.  145.15 and 145.73(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Emergency response and notification. In the case of a confirmed  positive of NAI in the subpopulation of the compartment, the management  of the compartment must notify the Service. The Service will immediately  suspend the status of the compartment. A compartment will be eligible to  resume trade with importing countries only after the compartment has  adopted the necessary measures to reestablish the biosecurity level and  confirm that NAI is not present in the compartment and the Service has  reevaluated the management and biosecurity measures of the compartment  and approved said compartment for trade.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [79 FR 38760, July 9, 2014]</p>
