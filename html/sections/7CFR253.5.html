The State agency shall encourage appropriate organizations, county extension home economists, expanded Food and Nutrition Program aides, and qualified volunteers to provide food and nutrition information, menus, or cooking demonstrations, as appropriate for participating households. The State agency shall encourage the dissemination of food and nutrition information designed to improve the nutrition of households on reservations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records and reports. The State agency shall keep records and submit reports and other information as required by FNS. Records required under this part shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of the submission of the annual financial status report, SF-269; except that, if any litigation, claim or audit is started before the expiration of the three year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring. In accordance with its responsibility for efficient and effective program administration the State agency shall monitor and review its operations under this part to ensure compliance with the provisions of this part and with any applicable instructions of FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall review program operations at least annually, document program deficiencies and establish and implement specific plans of corrective action for deficiencies noted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reviews of operations shall include, but not be limited to, certification of households, determination of food preferences, distribution of commodities, fair hearing procedures, commodity inventories and timeliness and accuracy of reports to FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Program reviews and corrective action plans shall be available to FNS upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Investigations and complaints.

correct any irregularities or noncompliance with provisions relating to certification procedures, provision of services or household rights. The State agency shall document each investigation and action in sufficient detail to allow for FNS review of all State agency actions and information. The Department shall make investigations at the request of the State agency and ITO or when the Department determines an investigation is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Sanctions. If the State agency fails to comply with the provisions of this part or its plan of operation, FNS may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Take action against any State agency under Sec. 253.11(g) with respect to administrative funds available from FNS for use by the State agency or (2) disqualify the State agency from further distribution of commodities to households. Disqualification of the State agency shall not prevent FNS or the Department from taking other actions, including prosecution under applicable Federal statutes, when deemed necessary. Reinstatement shall be contingent upon approval by FNS of the State agency's plan for corrective action or determination by FNS that the State agency has complied with any other requirements for reinstatement which FNS may set forth. These provisions apply to all State agencies, regardless of whether the Program is administered by an agency of the State government or an ITO. If the ITO is disqualified as a State agency, an appropriate agency of State government shall administer the Food Distribution Program on the reservation. If an agency of State government is disqualified as the State agency for the Food Distribution Program on the reservation, the ITO may request in writing a capability determination for program administration in accordance with Sec. 253.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Appeals.
