                            <p class="depth0">Tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes may be removed from a factory or an export warehouse and cigars may be withdrawn from a customs warehouse, without payment of tax, for delivery to vessels and aircraft, as supplies, for consumption beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States, subject to the applicable provisions of this part. Deliveries may be made to vessels actually engaged in foreign, intercoastal, or noncontiguous territory trade (i.e., vessels operating on a regular schedule in trade or actually transporting passengers and/or cargo (a) between a port in the United States and a foreign port; (b) between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States; or (c) between a port on the mainland of the United States and a port in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States; between a port in Alaska and a port in Hawaii; or between a port in Alaska or Hawaii and a port in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States); to vessels clearing through customs for a port beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States; to vessels of war or other governmental activity; or to vessels of the United States documented to engage in the fishing business (including the whaling business), and foreign fishing (including whaling) vessels of 5 net tons or over. Such deliveries to vessels shall be subject to lading under customs supervision as provided in Sec. Sec. 44.207 and 44.263. As a condition to the lading of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, the customs authorities at the port of lading may, if they deem it necessary in order to protect the revenue, require assurances, satisfactory to them, from the master of the receiving vessel that the quantities to be laden are reasonable, considering the number of persons to be carried, the vessel's itinerary, the duration of its intended voyage, etc., and that such articles are to be used exclusively as supplies on the voyage. For this purpose, the customs authorities may require the master of the receiving vessel to submit, prior to lading, customs documentation for permission to lade the articles. Where the customs authorities allow only a portion of a shipment to be laden, the remainder of the shipment shall be returned to the bonded premises of the manufacturer, export warehouse proprietor, or customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment, or otherwise disposed of as approved by the appropriate TTB officer. Deliveries may be made to aircraft that are clearing through customs and that are enroute to a place beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States, and to aircraft operating on a regular schedule between U.S. customs areas as defined in the Air Commerce Regulations (19 CFR part 122). Deliveries may not be made to a vessel or aircraft stationed in the United States for an indefinite period

and where its schedule does not include operations outside such jurisdiction.
