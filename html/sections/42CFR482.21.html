The hospital's governing body must ensure that the program reflects the complexity of the hospital's organization and services; involves all hospital departments and services (including those services furnished under contract or arrangement); and focuses on indicators related to improved health outcomes and the prevention and reduction of medical errors. The hospital must maintain and demonstrate evidence of its QAPI program for review by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard: Program scope. (1) The program must include, but not be limited to, an ongoing program that shows measurable improvement in indicators for which there is evidence that it will improve health outcomes and identify and reduce medical errors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The program must include, but not be limited to, an ongoing program that shows measurable improvement in indicators for which there is evidence that it will improve health outcomes and identify and reduce medical errors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hospital must measure, analyze, and track quality indicators, including adverse patient events, and other aspects of performance that assess processes of care, hospital service and operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard: Program data.

As part of its quality assessment and performance improvement program, the hospital must conduct performance improvement projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number and scope of distinct improvement projects conducted annually must be proportional to the scope and complexity of the hospital's services and operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A hospital may, as one of its projects, develop and implement an information technology system explicitly designed to improve patient safety and quality of care. This project, in its initial stage of development, does not need to demonstrate measurable improvement in indicators related to health outcomes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The hospital must document what quality improvement projects are being conducted, the reasons for conducting these projects, and the measurable progress achieved on these projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A hospital is not required to participate in a QIO cooperative project, but its own projects are required to be of comparable effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standard: Executive responsibilities. The hospital's governing body (or organized group or individual who assumes full legal authority and responsibility for operations of the hospital), medical staff, and administrative officials are responsible and accountable for ensuring the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That an ongoing program for quality improvement and patient safety, including the reduction of medical errors, is defined, implemented, and maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the hospital-wide quality assessment and performance improvement efforts address priorities for improved quality of care and patient safety; and that all improvement actions are evaluated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That clear expectations for safety are established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That adequate resources are allocated for measuring, assessing, improving, and sustaining the hospital's performance and reducing risk to patients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the determination of the number of distinct improvement projects is conducted annually.
