                            <p class="depth0">The Act does not and unions may not regulate the contents of  campaign literature which candidates may wish to have distributed by the  union. This is left to the discretion of each candidate. The labor  organization may not require that it be permitted to read a copy of the  literature before it is sent out, nor may it censor the statements of  the candidates in any way, even though the statement may include  derogatory remarks about other candidates. Furthermore, a union's  contention that mailing of certain campaign literature may constitute  libel for which it may   be sued has been held not to justify its refusal to distribute the  literature, since the union is under a statutory duty to distribute the  material. \37\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\37\ See Philo v.
