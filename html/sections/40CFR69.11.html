will not issue a PSD permit to such a unit prior to submission of such data or data which the EPA finds to be an equivalent and acceptable substitute; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If any electric generating unit covered by this paragraph is operated either prior to the issuance of a final PSD permit or without BACT equipment, that electric generating unit shall be deemed in violation of this waiver and the CAA beginning on the date of commencement of construction of that unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A waiver of the three nonattainment area requirements (a construction ban, the use of lowest achievable emission rate control equipment, and emission offset requirements) currently applicable to the Cabras-Piti area is granted for electric generating units with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A tower and meteorological station shall be constructed in the Cabras-Piti area by May 1, 1993;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Meteorological data shall be collected from the Cabras-Piti station which is sufficient to run air quality models both to demonstrate no current exceedences of the primary national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide (``sulfur dioxide NAAQS''), as set forth at 40 CFR 50.4, and sufficient to submit a complete request for redesignation of the area to attainment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ambient sulfur dioxide monitors shall be installed and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth at 40 CFR part 58, the PSD air monitoring requirements, and any additional monitoring requested by EPA to verify the efficacy of the intermittent control strategy (``ICS'') of fuel switching;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Within three years from the effective date of this waiver, the Governor of Guam shall submit to the EPA a complete request that the Cabras-Piti area be redesignated to attainment for the sulfur dioxide NAAQS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Electric generating units to be constructed in the Cabras-Piti area must submit applications for PSD permits as though the area had been redesignated to attainment for the sulfur dioxide NAAQS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Cabras-Piti area electric generating units shall comply with the fuel switching ICS described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If the collected data and air quality analysis does not demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that there are no current or likely future exceedences of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS, the EPA will so notify the Governor of Guam;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Within six months of such notification, the Governor of Guam shall submit to the EPA an implementation plan which includes a schedule of emission reductions and/or control measures that will ensure achievement of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS within one year of submission of the implementation plan;
