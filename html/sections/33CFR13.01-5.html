                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Lifesaving Medals may be awarded to any person who rescues or  endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck or other  peril of the water. In order for a person to be eligible for a  Lifesaving Medal the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in  waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof,  or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters,  one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States  or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United  States. If such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's  own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of  gold. If such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently  distinguished to deserve the medal of gold but evidences the exercise of  such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of  silver. Lifesaving Medals may be awarded posthumously.</p>
