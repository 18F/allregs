This subpart contains OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5305, which authorizes the establishment of special rates of pay for Federal employees in executive agencies to address significant recruitment or retention problems. This subpart also contains rules for determining an employee's rate of pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when conditions for coverage under a special rate schedule are changed. All other pay actions for special rate employees are governed by the pay-setting rules in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. Except as explained in Sec. 530.303(a), this subpart applies only to GS employees.</p>
