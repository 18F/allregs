Sections 517.5 through 517.7 of this part apply to all contracting activities, with the exception of contracting for legal services, engaged in by OTS in any of its capacities, for all OTS functions authorized by law. These contracts will typically pertain to services in support of OTS's business operations, such as consulting, programming, auditing, expert witnesses, customized training, relocation services, information systems technology (computer systems, database management, software and office automation), or micrographic services; or in support of its day-to-day operations, such as facilities management, mail and printing services, or procurement of office supplies, furniture and office equipment.</p>
