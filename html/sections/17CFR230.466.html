effectiveness of a registration statement, and such suspension shall remain in effect until the Commission furnishes written notice to the depositary that the suspension has been terminated. Any suspension, so long as it is in effect, shall apply to any registration statement that has been filed but has not, at the time of such suspension, become effective and to any registration statement the depositary files after such suspension. Any such suspension applies only to the ability to designate the date and time of effectiveness under paragraph (a) of this section and does not otherwise affect the registration statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission may, in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, suspend the ability of a depositary to designate the date and time of
