Notwithstanding the requirements of any other section in this part, a Class II gaming system must have the capacity to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Display the information specified in Sec. 547.11(b)(5)(ii) through (vi) for the last five vouchers or coupons printed and the last five vouchers or coupons accepted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display a complete transaction history for the last five cashless transactions made and the last five cashless transactions accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Software signature verification. The manufacturer or developer of the Class II gaming system must provide to the testing laboratory and to the TGRA an industry-standard methodology, acceptable to the TGRA, for verifying the Class II gaming system game software. For example, for game software stored on rewritable media, such methodologies include signature algorithms and hashing formulas such as SHA-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Test, diagnostic, and demonstration modes. If test, diagnostic, and/or demonstration modes are provided, the Class II gaming system must, for those components actively involved in the test, diagnostic, or demonstration mode:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly indicate when that component is in the test, diagnostic, or demonstration mode;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not alter financial data on that component other than temporary data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Only be available after entering a specific mode;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disable credit acceptance and payment unless credit acceptance or payment is being tested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Terminate all mode-specific functions upon exiting a mode.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Multigame.
