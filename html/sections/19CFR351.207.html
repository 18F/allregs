                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. ``Termination'' is a term of art that refers to  the end of an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding in which an  order has not yet been issued. The Act establishes a variety of  mechanisms by which an investigation may be terminated, most of which  are dealt with in this section. For rules regarding the termination of a  suspended investigation following a review under section 751 of the Act,  see Sec. 351.222.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal of petition; self-initiated investigations--(1) In  general. The Secretary may terminate an investigation under section  704(a)(1)(A) or section 734(a)(1)(A) (withdrawal of petition) or under  section 704(k) or section 734(k) (self-initiated investigation) of the  Act, provided that the Secretary concludes that termination is in the  public interest. If the Secretary terminates an investigation, the  Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Termination  of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Investigation,'' together with,  when appropriate, a copy of any correspondence with the petitioner  forming the basis of the withdrawal and the termination. (For the  treatment in a subsequent investigation of records compiled in an  investigation in which the petition was withdrawn, see section  704(a)(1)(B) or section 734(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)</em> of the Act.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act (whichever is applicable)  regarding public interest and consultations with consuming industries  and producers and workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lack of interest. The Secretary may terminate an investigation  based upon lack of interest (see section 782(h)(1) of the Act). Where  the Secretary terminates an investigation under this paragraph, the  Secretary will publish the notice described in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Negative determination. An investigation terminates  automatically upon publication in the Federal Register of the  Secretary's negative final determination or the Commission's negative  preliminary or final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> End of suspension of liquidation. When an investigation  terminates, if the Secretary previously ordered suspension of  liquidation, the Secretary will order the suspension ended on the date  of publication of the notice of termination referred to in paragraph (b)  of this section or on the date of publication of a negative  determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, and will  instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.</p>
