The Treasurer of the United States is the custodian of such fund, and all monies and securities in such fund shall be held in trust by the Treasurer and shall not be money or property of the United States. The Treasurer shall make disbursements from such funds only upon the order of the Director, OWCP, as delegatee of the Secretary. The Act requires that the Treasurer give bond, in an amount to be fixed and with securities to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General of the United States, conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duty as custodian of such fund.</p>
