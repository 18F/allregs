                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 3409.507-1, insert the following provision in all  solicitations anticipated to result in contract actions for services  above the simplified acquisition threshold:</p><p class="depth0">Conflict of Interest Certification (MAR 2011)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by  signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its  knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that  could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest,  (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or  apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its  staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant  has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of  interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the  relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of  the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may  arise in the following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unequal access to information. A potential contractor,  subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public  information through its performance on a government contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor,  employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or  program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government  contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor,  employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse,  parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or  give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation  of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the  government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to  recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility.  ``Impaired objectivity'' includes but is not limited to the following  situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the  relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial  interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that  may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or  institution in the course of implementing any program administered by  the Department;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches  that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property,  or services; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical  viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific  curriculum, specific products, property, or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any  actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of  interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential  conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their  objectivity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent  conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate  actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict,  including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict,  when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views,  disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or  modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In  this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably  foreseeable conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees  that if ``impaired objectivity'', or an actual or potential conflict of  interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the  award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the  contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of  actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid,  mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent  conflict of interest).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for  convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary  to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was  aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered  an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or  misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the  Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other  remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies  include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further  remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the  Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the  Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities  related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be  those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related  to a conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied,  the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to  eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the  satisfaction of the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Conflict of Interest Certification.</p><p class="depth2">The offeror, [insert name of offeror], hereby certifies that, to the  best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently  planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise)  relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order  resulting from Request for Proposal No. [insert number] that would  create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent  conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate  family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its  ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance  or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage.  In this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably  foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it  has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and  removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such conflict  of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).</p><p class="depth2">Offeror's Name_________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">RFP/Contract No._______________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">Signature______________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">Title__________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">Date___________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
