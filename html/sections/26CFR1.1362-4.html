                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation is treated as continuing to be an S  corporation or a QSub (or, an invalid election to be either an S  corporation or a QSub is treated as valid) during the period specified  by the Commissioner if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The corporation made a valid election under section 1362(a) or  section 1361(b)(3) and the election terminated or the corporation made  an election under section 1362(a) or section 1361(b)(3) that was  invalid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commissioner determines that the termination or invalidity  was inadvertent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within a reasonable period of time after discovery of the  terminating event or invalid election, steps were taken so that the  corporation for which the election was made or the termination occurred  is a small business corporation or a QSub, as the case may be, or to  acquire the required shareholder consents; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The corporation and shareholders agree to adjustments that the  Commissioner may require for the period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inadvertent termination or inadvertently invalid election. For  purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the determination of whether  a termination or invalid election was inadvertent is made by the  Commissioner. The corporation has the burden of establishing that under  the relevant facts and circumstances the Commissioner should determine  that the termination or invalid election was inadvertent. The fact that  the terminating event or invalidity of the election was not reasonably  within the control of the corporation and, in the case of a termination,  was not part of a plan to terminate the election, or the fact that the  terminating event or circumstance took place without the knowledge of  the corporation, notwithstanding its due diligence to safeguard itself  against such an event or circumstance, tends to establish that the  termination or invalidity of the election was inadvertent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Corporation's request for determination of an inadvertent  termination or invalid election. A corporation that believes that the  termination or invalidity of its election was inadvertent may request a  determination from the Commissioner that the termination or invalidity  of its election was inadvertent. The request is made in the form of a  ruling request and should set forth all relevant facts pertaining to the  event or circumstance including, but not limited to, the facts described  in paragraph (b) of this section, the date of the corporation's election  (or intended election) under section 1362(a) or 1361(b)(3), a detailed  explanation of the event or circumstance causing the termination or  invalidity, when and how the event or circumstance was discovered, and  the steps taken under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments. The Commissioner may require any adjustments that  are appropriate. In general, the adjustments required should be  consistent with the treatment of the corporation as an S corporation or  QSub during the period specified by the Commissioner. In the case of  stock held by an ineligible shareholder that causes an inadvertent  termination or invalid election for an S corporation under section  1362(f), the Commissioner may require the ineligible shareholder to be  treated as a shareholder of the S corporation during the period the  ineligible shareholder actually held stock in the corporation. Moreover,  the Commissioner may require protective adjustments that prevent the  loss of any revenue due to the holding of stock by an ineligible  shareholder (for example, a nonresident alien).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Corporation and shareholder consents. The corporation and all  persons who were shareholders of the corporation at any time during the  period specified by the Commissioner must consent to any adjustments  that the Commissioner may require. Each consent should be in the form of  a statement agreeing to make the adjustments. The statement must be  signed by the shareholder (in the case of shareholder consent) or a  person authorized to sign the return required by section 6037 (in the  case of corporate consent). See Sec. 1.1362-6(b)(2) for persons  required to sign consents. A shareholder's consent statement should  include the name, address, and taxpayer identification numbers of the  corporation and shareholder, the number of shares of stock owned by the  shareholder, and the dates on which the shareholder owned any stock. The  corporate consent statement should include the name, address, and  taxpayer identification numbers of the corporation and each shareholder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Status of corporation. The status of the corporation after the  terminating event or invalid election and before the determination of  inadvertence is determined by the Commissioner. Inadvertent termination  or inadvertent invalid election relief may be granted retroactively for  all years for which the terminating event or circumstance giving rise to  invalidity is effective, in   which case the corporation is treated as if its election was valid or  had not terminated. Alternatively, relief may be granted only for the  period in which the corporation became eligible for subchapter S or QSub  treatment, in which case the corporation is treated as a C corporation  or, in the case of a QSub with an inadvertently terminated or invalid  election, as a separate C corporation, during the period for which the  corporation was not eligible for its intended status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and  (f) of this section are effective on August 14, 2008.  [T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55453, Nov. 25, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9422, 73 FR  47530, Aug. 14, 2008]</p>
