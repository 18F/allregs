                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decision by a hearing examiner. If the hearing is held by a  hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial  decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his  recommended findings and proposed decision to the Secretary for a final  decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be  mailed to the applicant or recipient and the complainant. Where the  initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or  recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial  decision file with the Secretary his exceptions to the initial decision,  with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Secretary  may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on  the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision.  Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the  Secretary shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision  thereon including the reasons therefor. The decision of the Secretary  shall be mailed promptly to the applicant or recipient and the  complainant, if any. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of  review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decisions on record or review by the Secretary. Whenever a  record is certified to the Secretary for decision or he reviews the  decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a), or whenever  the Secretary conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be  given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written  statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the  Secretary shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and  the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a  hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 31.9(a) a decision shall be made by  the Secretary on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given  in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or the  Secretary shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or  exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements  imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the  applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension  or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial  assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and  may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are  consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this  part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial  assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended  to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in  default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this  part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless   and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Secretary that  it will fully comply with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Post-termination proceedings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An applicant or recipient  adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (c) of this  section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal  financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that  order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with  this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully  comply with this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order  entered pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section may at any time  request the Secretary to restore fully its eligibility to receive  Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by  information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the  requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the Secretary  determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore  such eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or  recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why  it believes the Secretary to have been in error. It shall thereupon be  given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in  accordance with rules of procedure issued by the Secretary. The  applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves  at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)  of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the  sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (e) of this  section shall remain in effect.  [29 FR 16284, Dec. 4, 1964.
