                            <p class="depth0">When documents, such as freight bills or bills of lading, are numerous, the officer may refuse to receive all the documents in evidence and instead admit only a limited number of representative documents. He may instruct, if the proffer be for the purpose of proving damage, that introduction be deferred until there is opportunity to comply with Sec.  1133.2. If the proffer be for another purpose the officer may require the party in orderly fashion to abstract the relevant data from the documents, affording other parties reasonable opportunity to examine both the documents and the abstract, and thereupon offer such abstract in evidence in exhibit form.
