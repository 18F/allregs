The goals and objectives of this part are the same as the goals and objectives of 12 U.S.C. 1701z-11, which shall be referred to in this part as ``the Statute.'' With respect to the disposition of multifamily projects under subpart A, HUD may follow any other method of disposition, as determined by the Secretary.
