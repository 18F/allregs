                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether occupational qualifications will be deemed to be ``bona  fide'' to a specific job and ``reasonably necessary to the normal  operation of the   particular business,'' will be determined on the basis of all the  pertinent facts surrounding each particular situation. It is anticipated  that this concept of a bona fide occupational qualification will have  limited scope and application. Further, as this is an exception to the  Act it must be narrowly construed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employer asserting a BFOQ defense has the burden of proving  that (1) the age limit is reasonably necessary to the essence of the  business, and either (2) that all or substantially all individuals  excluded from the job involved are in fact disqualified, or (3) that  some of the individuals so excluded possess a disqualifying trait that  cannot be ascertained except by reference to age. If the employer's  objective in asserting a BFOQ is the goal of public safety, the employer  must prove that the challenged practice does indeed effectuate that goal  and that there is no acceptable alternative which would better advance  it or equally advance it with less discriminatory impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Many State and local governments have enacted laws or  administrative regulations which limit employment opportunities based on  age. Unless these laws meet the standards for the establishment of a  valid bona fide occupational qualification under section 4(f)(1) of the  Act, they will be considered in conflict with and effectively superseded  by the ADEA.</p>
