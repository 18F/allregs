The proposal shall include full information bearing on the frequency and duration of the irregular or occasional overtime work required; the nature of the work which prevents hours of duty from being controlled administratively; the necessity for the employee being generally responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require him to remain on duty; and any other pertinent conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The period of time during which an employee continues to receive premium pay on an annual basis under Sec. 550.151 under the authority of paragraphs (c) or (g) of Sec. 550.162 is not considered in computing the average hours of irregular and occasional overtime work under this section.
