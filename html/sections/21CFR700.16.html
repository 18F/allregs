                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Zirconium-containing complexes have been used as an ingredient  in cosmetics and/or cosmetics that are also drugs, as, for example,  aerosol antiperspirants. Evidence indicates that certain zirconium  compounds have caused human skin granulomas and toxic effects in the  lungs and other organs of experimental animals. When used in aerosol  form, some zirconium will reach the deep portions of the lungs of users.  The lung is an organ, like skin, subject to the development of  granulomas. Unlike the skin, the lung will not reveal the presence of  granulomatous changes until they have become advanced and, in some  cases, permanent. It is the view of the Commissioner that zirconium is a  deleterious substance that may render any cosmetic aerosol product that  contains it injurious to users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any aerosol cosmetic product containing zirconium is deemed to  be adulterated under section 601(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any such cosmetic product introduced in interstate commerce  after September 15, 1977 is subject to regulatory action.
