We will pay for these examinations.  However, we will not pay for any medical examination arranged by you or  your representative without our advance approval. If we arrange for the  examination or test, we will give you reasonable notice of the date,  time, and place the examination or test will be given, and the name of  the person or facility who will do it. We will also give the examiner  any necessary background information about your condition.  [56 FR 36964, Aug. 1, 1991]</p>
