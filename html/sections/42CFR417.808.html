A reporting period must be 12 consecutive months, except that the HCPP's initial reporting period for participating in Medicare may be as short as 6 months or as long as 18 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An HCPP must submit to CMS an interim cost report and enrollment data applicable to the first 6-month period of the HCPP's reporting period in the form and detail specified by CMS. The interim cost report must be submitted not later than 45 days after the close of the first 6-month period of the HCPP's reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of an interim payment based on the actual monthly enrollment in an HCPP, CMS and the HCPP

may agree to a uniform monthly interim reimbursement rate for a reporting period. This interim rate is based on the HCPP's budget and enrollment forecast, if CMS is satisfied that the rate is consistent with efficiency and economy, and will not result in excessive adjustment at the end of the reporting period.</p>
