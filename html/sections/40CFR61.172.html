                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b)-(f) of this section do not  apply to any copper converter at a facility where the total arsenic  charging rate for the copper converter department averaged over a 1-year  period is less than 75 kg/hr (165 lb/hr), as determined under  Sec. 61.174(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of each copper converter subject to the  provisions of this subpart shall reduce inorganic arsenic emissions to  the atmosphere by meeting the following design, equipment, work  practice, and operational requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Install, operate, and maintain a secondary hood system on each  copper converter. Each secondary hood system shall consist of a hood  enclosure, air curtain fan(s), exhaust system fan(s), and ductwork that  conveys the captured emissions to a control device, and shall meet the  following specifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The configuration and dimensions of the hood enclosure shall be  such that the copper converter mouth, charging ladles, skimming ladles,  and any other material transfer vessels used will be housed within the  confines or influence of the hood enclosure during each mode of copper  converter operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The back of the hood enclosure shall be fully enclosed and  sealed against the primary hood. Portions of the side-walls in contact  with the copper converter shall be sealed against the converter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Openings in the top and front of the hood enclosure to allow  for the entry and egress of ladles and crane appartus shall be minimized  to the fullest extent practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The hood enclosure shall be fabricated in such a manner and of  materials of sufficient strength to withstand incidental contact with  ladles and crane apparatus with no significant damage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> One side-wall of the hood enclosure shall be equipped with a  horizontal-slotted plenum along the top, and the opposite side-wall  shall be equipped with an exhaust hood. The horizontal-slotted plenum  shall be designed to allow the distance from the base to the top of the  horizontal slot to be adjustable up to a dimension of 76 mm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be connected to a fan. When  activated, the fan shall push air through the horizontal slot, producing  a horizontal air curtain above the copper converter that is directed to  the exhaust hood. The fan power output installed shall be sufficient to  overcome static pressure losses through the ductwork upstream of the  horizontal-slotted plenum and across the plenum, and to deliver at least  22,370 watts (30 air horsepower) at the horizontal-slotted plenum  discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The exhaust hood shall be sized to completely intercept the  airstream from the horizontal-slotted plenum combined with the  additional airflow resulting from entrainment of the surrounding air.  The exhaust hood shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan  shall pull the combined airstream into the exhaust hood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The entire secondary hood system shall be equipped with  dampers and instrumentation, as appropriate, so that the desired air  curtain and exhaust flow are maintained during each mode of copper  converter operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Optimize the capture of secondary inorganic arsenic emissions by  operating the copper converter and secondary hood system at all times as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Copper converter. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Increase the air curtain and exhaust flow  rates to their optimum conditions prior to raising the primary hood and  rolling the copper converter out for charging, skimming, or pouring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Once rolled out, prior to the commencement of skimming or  pouring, hold the copper converter in an idle position until fuming from  the molten bath has been minimized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> During skimming, raise the receiving ladle off the ground and  position the ladle as close to the copper converter mouth as possible to  minimize the drop distance between the converter mouth and the receiving  ladle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Control the rate of flow into the receiving ladle to the extent  practicable to minimize fuming.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Upon the completion of each charge, withdraw the charging ladle  or vessel used from the confines of the secondary hood in a slow,  deliberate manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> During charging, skimming, or pouring, ensure that the crane  block does not disturb the air flow between the horizontal-slotted  plenum and the exhaust hood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Secondary hood system. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Operate the secondary hood system  under conditions that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic  arsenic emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 30 days after the effective date of this subpart, or  within 30 days after the initial operation of each secondary hood  system, whichever comes later, provide to the Administrator a list of  operating conditions for the secondary hood system that will result in  the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions. This list shall  specify the operating parameters for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The dimensions of the horizontal slot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The velocity of air through the horizontal slot during each mode  of converter operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The distance from the horizontal slot to the exhaust hood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The face velocity at the opening of the exhaust hood during each  mode of converter operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Operate the secondary hood system under the conditions listed in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless otherwise specified by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days if there is  any change in the operating conditions submitted pursuant to the  requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) that will result in any  reduction in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comply with the following inspection and maintenance  requirements after installing the secondary hood system required in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At least once every month, visually inspect the components of  the secondary hood system that are exposed to potential damage from  crane and ladle operation, including the hood enclosure, side- and back- wall hood seals, and the horizontal slot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Replace or repair any defective or damaged components of the  secondary hood system within 30 days after discovering the defective or  damaged components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the  provisions of this subpart shall cause or allow to be discharged into  the atmosphere any copper converter secondary emissions that exit from a  control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 11.6 mg/dscm  (0.0051 gr/dscf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the  provisions of this subpart shall submit a description of a plan for  control of inorganic arsenic emissions from the copper converter and  associated air pollution control equipment. This plan shall be submitted  within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, unless a waiver  of compliance is granted under Sec. 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is  granted, the plan shall be submitted on a date set by the Administrator.  Approval of the plan will be granted by the Administrator provided he  finds that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It includes a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions  and for reporting them immediately to smelter supervisory personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It specifies the procedures that will be followed to ensure that  equipment or process breakdowns due entirely or in part to poor  maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It specifies the measures that will be taken to ensure  compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator shall implement the plan required under  paragraph (d) of this section unless otherwise specified by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction, the owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the  provisions of this subpart shall operate and maintain the converter and  associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with  good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions of  inorganic arsenic to the atmosphere to the maximum extent practicable.  Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures  are being used will be based on information available to the  Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring  results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, inspection of  the source, and review of other records.
