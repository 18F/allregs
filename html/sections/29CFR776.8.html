                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The activities constituting ``commerce'' within the meaning of the phrase ``engaged in commerce'' in sections 6 and 7 of the Act are defined in section 3(b) as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Commerce means trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States, or between any State and any place outside thereof. \21\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\21\ As amended by section 3(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949.

As has been noted in Sec. 776.7, the word ``State'' in this definition refers not only to any of the fifty States but also to the District of Columbia and to any Territory or possession of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It should be observed that the term commerce is very broadly defined. The definition does not limit the term to transportation, or to the ``commercial'' transactions involved in ``trade,'' although these are expressly included. Neither is the term confined to commerce in ``goods.'' Obviously, ``transportation'' or ``commerce'' between any State and any place outside its boundaries includes a movement of persons as well as a movement of goods. And ``transmission'' or ``communication'' across State lines constitutes ``commerce'' under the definition, without reference to whether anything so transmitted or communicated is ``goods.'' \22\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\22\ ``Goods'' is, however, broadly defined in the Act. See Sec. 776.20(a).
The inclusion of the term ``commerce'' in the definition of the same term as used in the Act implies that no special or limited meaning is intended; rather, that the scope of the term for purposes of the Act is at least as broad as it

would be under concepts of ``commerce'' established without reference to this definition.</p>
