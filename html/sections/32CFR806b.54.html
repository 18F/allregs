Appendix C to Part 806b--DoD `Blanket Routine Uses'</p><p class="depth0">Certain DoD ``blanket routine uses'' have been established that are applicable to every record system maintained by the Department of the Air Force, unless specifically stated otherwise within the particular record system notice. These additional routine uses of the records are published only once in the Air Force's Preamble to its compilation of records systems in the interest of simplicity, economy and to avoid redundancy.</p><p class="depth0">a.

Appendix D to Part 806b--General and Specific Exemptions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All systems of records maintained by the Department of the Air Force shall be exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to the extent that the system contains any information properly classified under Executive Order 12958 and that is required by Executive Order to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to parts of all systems of records including those not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein, which contain isolated items of properly classified information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An individual is not entitled to have access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No system of records within Department of the Air Force shall be considered exempt under subsection (j) or (k) of the Privacy Act until the exemption rule for the system of records has been published as a final rule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consistent with the legislative purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Department of the Air Force will grant access to non-exempt material in the records being maintained. Disclosure will be governed by the Department of the Air Force's Privacy Instruction, but will be limited to the extent that identity of confidential sources will not be compromised; subjects of an investigation of an actual or potential violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the physical safety of witnesses, informants and law enforcement personnel will not be endangered, the privacy of third parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective law enforcement. Whenever possible, information of the above nature will be deleted from the requested documents and the balance made available. The controlling principle behind this limited access is to allow disclosures except those indicated above. The decisions to release information from these systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> General Exemptions. The following systems of records claim an exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), with the exception of F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records and F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records. They claim both the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemption, and are listed under this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI A, Counter Intelligence Operations and Collection Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI C, Criminal Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI D, Investigative Support Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> System identifier and name: F031 AF SP E, Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasons: (A) To protect ongoing investigations and to protect from access criminal investigation information contained in this record system, so as not to jeopardize any subsequent judicial or administrative process taken as a result of information contained in the file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the subject criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection this subsection will not be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> From subsection (d) because access the records contained in this system would inform the subject of an investigation of existence of that investigation, provide subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> From subsection (e)(4)(H) because system of records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> From subsection (f) because this system of records has been exempted from access provisions of subsection (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> System identifier and name: F031 AF SF A, Correction and Rehabilitation Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> From subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j)(2) of the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment reporting on investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative techniques and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> From subsection (f) because this system of records has been exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> From subsection (g) because this system of records compiled for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of subsections (d) and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> System identifier and name: F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemption: (A) Parts of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. Note: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting of disclosure would inform a subject that he or she is under investigation. This information would provide considerable advantage to the subject in providing him or her with knowledge concerning the nature of the investigation and the coordinated investigative efforts and techniques employed by the cooperating agencies. This would greatly impede the Air Force IG's criminal law enforcement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From subsection (c)(4) and (d), because notification would alert a subject to the fact that an open investigation on that individual is taking place, and might weaken the ongoing investigation, reveal investigative techniques, and place confidential informants in jeopardy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because the nature of the criminal and/or civil investigative function creates unique problems in prescribing a specific parameter in a particular case with respect to what information is relevant or necessary. Also, information may be received which may relate to a case under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. The maintenance of this information

may be necessary to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement purposes and to establish patterns of activity that may relate to the jurisdiction of other cooperating agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information to the fullest extent possible directly from the subject individual may or may not be practical in a criminal and/or civil investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual with a form containing a Privacy Act Statement would tend to inhibit cooperation by many individuals involved in a criminal and/or civil investigation. The effect would be somewhat adverse to established investigative methods and techniques.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because this system of records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because the requirement that records be maintained with attention to accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness would unfairly hamper the investigative process. It is the nature of law enforcement for investigations to uncover the commission of illegal acts at diverse stages.

The Air Force recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals, to ensure sufficient protections for the privacy of personal information as we implement citizen-centered e-Government. Privacy issues must be addressed when systems are being developed, and privacy protections must be integrated into the development life cycle of these automated systems. The vehicle for addressing privacy issues in a system under development is the Privacy Impact Assessment. The Privacy Impact Assessment process also provides a means to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing individual privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this document is to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish the requirements for addressing privacy during the systems development process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Describe the steps required to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Define the privacy issues you will address in the Privacy Impact Assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Background. The Air Force is responsible for ensuring the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information. The Air Force recognizes that privacy protection is both a personal and fundamental right. Among the most

basic of individuals' rights is an expectation that the Air Force will protect the confidentiality of personal, financial, and employment information. Individuals also have the right to expect that the Air Force will collect, maintain, use, and disseminate identifiable personal information and data only as authorized by law and as necessary to carry out agency responsibilities. Personal information is protected by the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Title 5, U.S.C. 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, which affords individuals the right to privacy in records maintained and used by Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Note: 5 U.S.C. 552a includes Public Law 100-503, The Computer Matching and Privacy Act of 1988. \13\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\13\ http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/1975OMB_PAGuide/jun1989.pdf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public Law 100-235, The Computer Security Act of 1987, \14\ which establishes minimum security practices for Federal computer systems.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ http://csrc.nist.gov/secplcy/csa--87.txt.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, \15\ which provides instructions to Federal agencies on how to comply with the fair information practices and security requirements for operating automated information systems.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public Law 107-347, Section 208, E-Gov Act of 2002, which aims to ensure privacy in the conduct of federal information activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Title 5, U.S.C. 552, The Freedom of Information Act, as amended, which provides for the disclosure of information maintained by Federal agencies to the public while allowing limited protections for privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> DoD Directive 5400.11, Department of Defense Privacy Program, \16\ December 13, 1999.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\16\ http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/540011.htm.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program, \17\ August 1983.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\17\ http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/540011r.htm.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Air Force Instruction 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Air Force Privacy Office is in the Office of the Air Force Chief Information Officer, Directorate of Plans and Policy, and is responsible for overseeing Air Force implementation of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth0">Section B--Privacy and Systems Development</p><p class="depth0">System Privacy. Rapid advancements in computer technology make it possible to store and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. These advancements have raised concerns about the impact of large computerized information systems on the privacy of data subjects. Public concerns about highly integrated information systems operated by the government make it imperative to commit to a positive and aggressive approach to protecting individual privacy. Air Force Chief Information Officer is requiring the use of this Privacy Impact Assessment in order to ensure that the systems the Air Force develops protect individuals' privacy. The Privacy Impact Assessment incorporates privacy into the development life cycle so that all system development initiatives can appropriately consider privacy issues from the earliest stages of design.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is a Privacy Impact Assessment? The Privacy Impact Assessment is a process used to evaluate privacy in information systems. The process is designed to guide system owners and developers in assessing privacy through the early stages of development. The process consists of privacy training, gathering data from a project on privacy issues, and identifying and resolving the privacy risks. The Privacy Impact Assessment process is described in detail in Section C, Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When is a Privacy Impact Assessment Done? The Privacy Impact Assessment is initiated in the early stages of the development of a system and completed as part of the required system life cycle reviews. Privacy must be considered when requirements are being analyzed and decisions are being made about data usage and system design. This applies to all of the development methodologies and system life cycles used in the Air Force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Who completes the Privacy Impact Assessment? Both the system owner and system developers must work together to complete the Privacy Impact Assessment. System owners must address what data is to be used, how the data is to be used, and who will use the data. The system developers must address whether the implementation of the owner's requirements presents any threats to privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What systems have to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment? Accomplish Privacy Impact Assessments when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates information in identifiable form from or about members of the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initiating a new collection of information, using information technology, that collects, maintains, or disseminates information in identifiable form for 10 or more persons excluding agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Systems as described above that are undergoing major modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Air Force or Major Command Privacy Act Officer reserves the right to request

that a Privacy Impact Assessment be completed on any system that may have privacy risks.</p><p class="depth0">Section C--Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment</p><p class="depth0">The Privacy Impact Assessment. This section describes the steps required to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment. These steps are summarized in Table A4.1, Outline of Steps for Completing a Privacy Impact Assessment.</p><p class="depth0">Training. Training on the Privacy Impact Assessment will be available, on request, from the Major Command Privacy Act Officer. The training consists of describing the Privacy Impact Assessment process and provides detail about the privacy issues and privacy questions to be answered to complete the Privacy Impact Assessment. Major Command Privacy Act Officers may use appendix E, Sections A, B, D, and E for this purpose. The intended audience is the personnel responsible for writing the Privacy Impact Assessment document.</p><p class="depth0">The Privacy Impact Assessment Document. Preparing the Privacy Impact Assessment document requires the system owner and developer to answer the privacy questions in Section E. A brief explanation should be written for each question. Issues that do not apply to a system should be noted as ``Not Applicable.'' During the development of the Privacy Impact Assessment document, the Major Command Privacy Act Officer will be available to answer questions related to the Privacy Impact Assessment process and other concerns that may arise with respect to privacy.</p><p class="depth0">Review of the Privacy Impact Assessment Document. Submit the completed Privacy Impact Assessment document to the Major Command Privacy Act Office for review. The purpose of the review is to identify privacy risks in the system.</p><p class="depth0">Approval of the Privacy Impact Assessment. The system life cycle review process (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Support Plan) will be used to validate the incorporation of the design requirements to resolve the privacy risks.

It states specifically:</p><p class="depth0">Each agency that maintains a system of records shall:</p><p class="depth0">Maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President;</p><p class="depth0">Collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs;</p><p class="depth0">Maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination;</p><p class="depth0">Establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.</p><p class="depth0">Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Accuracy--within sufficient tolerance for error to assure the quality of the record in terms of its use in making a determination.</p><p class="depth0">Completeness--all elements necessary for making a determination are present before such determination is made.</p><p class="depth0">Determination--any decision affecting an individual which, in whole or in part, is based on information contained in the record and which is made by any person or agency.</p><p class="depth0">Necessary--a threshold of need for an element of information greater than mere relevance and utility.</p><p class="depth0">Record--any item, collection or grouping of information about an individual and identifiable to that individual that is maintained by an agency.</p><p class="depth0">Relevance--limitation to only those elements of information that clearly bear on the determination(s) for which the records are intended.</p><p class="depth0">Routine Use--with respect to the disclosure of a record, the use of such record outside DoD for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.</p><p class="depth0">System of Records--a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.</p><p class="depth0">Timeliness--sufficiently current to ensure that any determination based on the record will be accurate and fair.</p><p class="depth0">Information and Privacy</p><p class="depth0">To fulfill the commitment of the Air Force to protect personal information, several issues must be addressed with respect to privacy.</p><p class="depth0">The use of information must be controlled.</p><p class="depth0">Information may be used only for a necessary and lawful purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Individuals must be informed in writing of the principal purpose and routine uses of the information being collected from them.</p><p class="depth0">Information collected for a particular purpose should not be used for another purpose without the data subject's consent unless such other uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law.</p><p class="depth0">Any information used must be sufficiently accurate, relevant, timely and complete to assure fair treatment of the individual.</p><p class="depth0">Given the availability of vast amounts of stored information and the expanded capabilities of information systems to process the information, it is foreseeable that there will be increased requests to share that information. With the potential expanded uses of data in automated systems it is important to remember that information can only be used for the purpose for which it was collected unless other uses are specifically authorized or mandated by law. If the data is to be used for other purposes, then the public must be provided notice of those other uses. These procedures do not in themselves create any legal rights, but are intended to express the full and sincere commitment of the Air Force to protect individual privacy rights and which provide redress for violations of those rights.</p><p class="depth0">Data in the System</p><p class="depth0">The sources of the information in the system are an important privacy consideration if the data is gathered from other than Air Force records. Information collected from non-Air Force sources should be verified, to the extent practicable, for accuracy, that the information is current, and complete. This is especially important if the information will be used to make determinations about individuals.</p><p class="depth0">Access to the Data</p><p class="depth0">Who has access to the data in a system must be defined and documented. Users of the data can be individuals, other systems, and other agencies. Individuals who have access to the data can be system users, system administrators, system owners, managers, and developers. When individuals are granted access to a system, their access should be limited, where possible, to only that data needed to perform their assigned duties. If individuals are granted access to all of the data in a system, procedures need to be in place to deter and detect browsing and unauthorized access. Other systems are any programs or projects that interface with the system and have access to the data. Other agencies can be International, Federal, state, or local entities that have access to Air Force data.</p><p class="depth0">Attributes of the Data</p><p class="depth0">When requirements for the data to be used in the system are being determined, those requirements must include the privacy attributes of the data. The privacy attributes are derived from the legal requirements imposed by The Privacy Act of 1974. First, the data must be relevant and necessary to accomplish the purpose of the system. Second, the data must be complete, accurate, and timely. It is important to ensure the data has these privacy attributes in order to assure fairness to the individual in making decisions based on the data.</p><p class="depth0">Maintenance of Administrative Controls</p><p class="depth0">Automation of systems can lead to the consolidation of processes, data, and the controls in place to protect the data. When administrative controls are consolidated, they should be evaluated so that all necessary controls remain in place to the degree necessary to continue to control access to and use of the data. Document record retention and disposal procedures and coordinate them with the Major Command Records Manager.</p><p class="depth0">Section E--Privacy Questions</p><p class="depth0">Data in the System</p><p class="depth0">1.
