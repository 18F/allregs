                                Sec. 1955.62  Removal and disposition of nonsecurity personal property
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If the former borrower has vacated the inventory property but left  items of value which do not customarily pass with title to the real  estate, such as furniture, personal effects, and chattels not covered by  an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 lien, the  personal property will be handled as outlined below unless otherwise  directed by a State supplement approved by OGC which is necessary to  comply with State law. For MFH, the removal and disposition of  nonsecurity personal property will be handled in accordance with the  tenant's lease or advice from OGC. When property is deemed to have no  value, it is recommended that it be photographed for documentation  before it is disposed of. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 official having custody of the property may request advice  from the State Office staff as necessary. Actions to effect removal of  items of value from inventory property shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification to owner or lienholder. The servicing official will  check the public records to see if there is a lien on any of the  personal property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there is a lien(s) of record, the servicing official will  notify the lienholder(s) by certified mail, return receipt requested,  that the personal property will be disposed of by FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 unless it is removed from the premises  within 7 days from the date of the letter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there are no liens of record, or if a lienholder notified in  accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section fails to remove the  property within the time specified, the servicing official will notify  the former borrower at the   last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the  personal property remaining on the premises will be disposed of by FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 unless it is removed  within 7 days from the date of the letter. If no address can be  determined, a copy of the letter should be posted on the front door of  the property and documentation entered in the running record of the FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposal of unclaimed personal property. If the property is not  removed by the former borrower or a lienholder after notification as  outlined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the servicing  official shall list the items with clear description, estimated value,  and indication of which are covered by a lien, if any, and submit the  list to the State Director with a request for authorization to have the  items removed and disposed of. Based on advice from OGC, the State  Director will give authorization and provide instructions for removal  and disposal of the personal property. If approved by OGC, the property  may be disposed of as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a reasonable amount can likely be realized by the agency from  sale of the personal property, it may be sold at public sale. Items  under lien will be sold first and the proceeds up to the amount of the  lien paid to the lienholders less a pro rata share of the sale expenses.  Proceeds from sale of items not under lien and proceeds in excess of the  amount due a lienholder will be remitted and applied in the following  order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the inventory account up to the amount of expenses incurred  by the Government in connection with sale of the personal property (such  as advertising and auctioneer, if used).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To an unsatisfied balance on the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 loan account, if any.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To the borrower, if whereabouts are known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If personal property is not sold, a mover or hauler may be  authorized to take the items for moving costs. Refer to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A (available  in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) for  guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of costs. Upon payment of all expenses incurred by the  Government in connection with the personal property, FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will allow the former borrower  or a lienholder access to the property to reclaim the personal property  at any time prior to its disposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Removal of abandoned motor vehicles from inventory property.  Since State laws vary concerning disposal of abandoned motor vehicles,  the State Director shall, with the advice of OGC, issue a State  supplement outlining the method to be followed which will comply with  applicable State laws.  [53 FR 35765, Sept. 14, 1988, as amended at 68 FR 61332, Oct. 28, 2003]</p>
