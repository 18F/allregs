                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When the County Supervisor learns that a borrower has  made a disposition of chattel security in a manner not provided for on  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1962.1 or  becomes aware of the misuse of proceeds by a borrower, corrective action  must be taken to protect the Government's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to borrowers. When a borrower has not properly accounted  for   the use of proceeds from the sale of chattel security, the County  Supervisor must request restitution by use of a letter similar to Guide  Letter 1962-A-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the borrower makes restitution or provides sufficient  information to enable the County Supervisor to post-approve the  transaction on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 1962-1, no further action will be taken against the borrower. Post- approval can only be given under the conditions set out in 1962.17(b) of  this subpart. Only one such transgression can be allowed in any period  covered by the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 431-2, or other similar plan of operation acceptable to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354, between annual security  inspections, whichever is appropriate, and this must be made clear to  the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the borrower does not make restitution, if the County  Supervisor cannot post-approve the transaction, or if the borrower makes  a second unauthorized disposition of security or a misuse of proceeds  after settling the first offense as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b)  of this section, the County Supervisor will proceed in accordance with  Sec. 1962.49 of this subpart.
