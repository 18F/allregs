                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each borrower will be given an opportunity to choose the  financial institution in which the supervised bank account will be  established, provided the financial institution is a member of the FDIC  or NCUA, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When accounts are established, it should be determined that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The financial institution is fully informed concerning the  provisions of the applicable deposit agreement,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agreements are reached with respect to the services to be  provided by the financial institution including the frequency and method  of transmittal of checking account statements, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agreement is reached with the financial institution regarding  the place where the counter-signature will be on the checks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When possible, Servicing Officials will make arrangements with  financial institutions to waive service charges in connection with  supervised bank accounts. However, there is no objection to the payment  by the borrower of a reasonable charge for such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each borrower, if the amount of any loan and grant funds,  plus any borrower contributions and funds from other sources to be  deposited in the supervised bank account will exceed the maximum amount  insurable by the Federal government, the financial institution will be  required to pledge collateral for the excess over that limit before the  deposit is made (see Sec. 1902.7   of this subpart). If the supervised bank account is a joint account, any  amount over the maximum amount insurable by the federal government must  be collateralized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Only one supervised bank account will be established for any  borrower regardless of the amount or source of funds, except for Rural  Rental Housing loans where separate accounts will be established for  each project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a supervised bank account is established, an original and  two copies of the applicable Deposit Agreement and the Interest-Bearing  Deposit Agreement (Exhibit B of this subpart), when applicable, will be  executed by the borrower, the financial institution, and a Servicing  Office employee. The original will be retained in the borrower's case  file, one executed copy will be delivered to the financial institution  and one executed copy to the borrower. An extra copy of the Interest- Bearing Deposit Agreement, when applicable, will be prepared and  attached to the certificate, passbook, or other evidence of deposit  representing the interest-bearing deposit.
