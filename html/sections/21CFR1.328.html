The term ``farm'' includes:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Facilities that pack or hold food, provided that all food used in such activities is grown, raised, or consumed on that farm or another farm under the same ownership; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Facilities that manufacture/process food, provided that all food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same ownership.</p><p class="depth0">Food has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the act. Examples of food include, but are not limited to fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food; animal feed, including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, including substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other articles that contact food; dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; infant formula; beverages, including alcoholic beverages and bottled water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned foods.</p><p class="depth0">Full-time equivalent employee means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours x 52 weeks).</p><p class="depth0">Holding means storage of food. Holding facilities include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturing/processing means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying, or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients.

Because a recipe must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to manufacture a product without quantity information and manufacturing instructions is not a recipe.</p><p class="depth0">Restaurant means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. ``Restaurant'' does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Facilities in which food is directly provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens, are restaurants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food is directly provided to animals are restaurants.</p><p class="depth2">Transporter means a person who has possession, custody, or control of an article of food in the United States for

This source can be either another transporter or a nontransporter.</p><p class="depth2">Transporter's immediate subsequent recipient means a person to whom a transporter delivered food.
