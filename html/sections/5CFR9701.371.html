                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 9701.371 through 9701.374 describe the transitional provisions that apply when DHS employees are converted to a pay system established under this subpart. An affected employee may convert from the GS system, a prevailing rate system, the SL/ST system, or the SES system, as provided in Sec. 9701.302. For the purpose of this section and Secs. 9701.372 through 9701.374, the terms ``convert,'' ``converted,'' ``converting,'' and ``conversion'' refer to employees who become

covered by the pay system without a change in position (as a result of a coverage determination made under Sec. 9701.102(b)) and exclude employees who are reassigned or transferred from a noncovered position to a position already covered by the DHS system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DHS will issue implementing directives prescribing the policies and procedures necessary to implement these transitional provisions.</p>
