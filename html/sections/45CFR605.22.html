                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or  activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in  its entirety it is readily accessible to qualified handicapped persons.  This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing  facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by  qualified handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirements of  paragraph (a)   of this section through such means as redesign of equipment,  reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings,  assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health,  welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites,  alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in  conformance with the requirements of Sec. 605.23, or any other methods  that result in making its program or activity accessible to qualified  handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural  changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in  achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing  among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of  this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that  serve qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Small health, welfare, or other social service providers. If a  recipient with fewer than fifteen employees that provides health,  welfare, or other social services finds, after consultation with a  qualified handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no  method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making  a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may,  as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped person to other  providers of those services that are accessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section within sixty days of the effective date of  this part except that where structural changes in facilities are  necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the  effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as  possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of  this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the  effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps  necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the  assistance of interested persons, including qualified handicapped  persons or organizations representing qualified handicapped persons. A  copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public  inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that  limit the accessibility of its program or activity to qualified  handicapped persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time  period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify the  steps of that will be taken during each year of the transition period;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to  ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision  or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of  services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usuable  by qualified handicapped persons.
