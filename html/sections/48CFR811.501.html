                            <p class="depth0">The contracting officer must not routinely include a liquidated damages provision in supply or construction contracts, regardless of dollar amount.

The decision to include liquidated damages provisions must conform to the criteria in FAR 11.501. In making this decision, the contracting officer must consider whether the necessity for timely delivery or performance as required in the contract schedule is so critical that a probable increase in contract price is justified. The contracting officer must not use a liquidated damages provision for any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As insurance against selection of a non-responsible bidder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As a substitute for efficient contract administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a penalty for failure to perform on time.</p>
