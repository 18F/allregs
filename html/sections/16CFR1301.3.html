                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Risk of injury. The Commission has studied 19 in-depth  investigation reports of accidents associated with tip-over of unstable  refuse bins. The 19 accidents, which involved 21 victims, resulted in 13  deaths. Of the 21 victims, 20 were children 10 years of age and under.  Additionally, Commission records show three death certificates for  victims, under 5 years of age, who were killed by refuse bins tipping  over. Therefore, the Commission finds that unreasonable risks of injury  or death from crushing due to tip-over are associated with certain  unstable refuse bins having an internal volume one cubic yard or  greater, which unreasonable risk this banning rule is designed to  eliminate or reduce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Products subject to this ban. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission finds that the  types of products subject to this ban are those manufactured metal  receptacles known in the solid waste collection trade as containers,  refuse bins, buckets, boxes or hoppers, with actual internal volumes of  one cubic yard or greater, used for the storage and transportation of  solid waste. They are fabricated in numerous sizes and configurations  for use with rear, side, front, hoist and roll-off loaded trash  collection trucks and are used by private firms and public agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Although unstable refuse bins subject to this ban may be in  various forms and shapes, the Commission's in-depth investigations into  accidents associated with metal refuse containers indicate that most  accidents have occurred with slant-sided metal refuse bins which are  used by rear and side-loaded trucks. Therefore, the Commission bases its  economic analysis of the potential impact of the ban upon the population  of these bins. Certain refuse bins such as front loaded, roll-off, box  and other types of large or broad based bins, because of their  configuration,   bulk and weight are likely to be inherently stable and are therefore not  included in the population of potentially unstable bins studied in this  economic analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission estimates that there may be approximately  638,000-716,000 slant-sided, metal refuse bins with an internal volume  one cubic yard or greater, which may be unstable. The population of  potentially unstable bins owned by some 10,000-15,000 private solid  waste collection firms in all parts of the United States and its  territories is estimated to be 359,000-371,000. These figures are  discussed in the Commission's Economic Impact Statement of April 22,  1977, which is available for review from the Commission's Office of the  Secretary, Washington, D.C. 20207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Need of the public for the product and effects on utility, cost,  and availability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The public need for refuse bins is substantial  since these products are used for the containment of solid waste and  thus contribute to public hygiene. The U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency estimates that 135,000,000 tons of solid waste were collected in  1976 from residential, commercial and industrial sources. Approximately  101,250,000 tons (75%) were collected by private firms and the remainder  by public agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission finds that the ban will not affect the utility  that consumers derive from the general use of refuse bins. The interest  of the public is in continuity, availability and price of solid waste  collection. The ban could result in a shift from bins which are subject  to the ban to other types of storage containers. Such a shift would not  affect solid waste collection and would entail a small price increase  for individual consumers. To the extent that injuries and deaths  associated with the use of unstable bins are reduced or eliminated as a  result of the ban, the public utility derived from the use of the  product will be increased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission finds that, based on its analysis of  industrial estimates, newly produced complying refuse bins will cost  approximately 1-10% more than currently produced noncomplying bins and  that existing inventories of unstable bins can be modified (depending  upon size) for about $45-$75 each. This modification cost estimate  includes the cost of material, shop labor, retrieval and return to  service, and the substitution of one bin for another for on-site  service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission estimates that the ban will not result in any  significant price increases for the delivery of solid waste collection  service to the general public because of the competitive structure of  the solid waste collection industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission finds that the ban will have no effect on the  availability of solid waste collection service to the general public.  Solid waste collection haulers who use products subject to this ban can  modify these refuse bins so that these products can continue to be used  for solid waste collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternatives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission has considered other means of  achieving the objective of this ban, but has found none that it believes  would have fewer adverse effects on competition or that would cause less  disruption or dislocation of manufacturing, servicing or other  commercial practices consistent with public health and safety. The  Commission estimates that this ban may, because of capital and testing  costs and maintenance capacity limitations, have an adverse effect on  individual firms within some markets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission estimates that the ban will not have an adverse  effect on the competitive structure of the solid waste collection  industry. The competitive nature of solid waste collection firms is  fostered because of low starting costs, particularly if a firm is owner- operated. The rate of entry and exit into and out of the industry for  small operators tends to be high relative to larger firms in the  industry. The ban will most likely not increase the degree of market  concentration among the larger firms nor affect the rate of entry into  or exit out of the industry by relatively smaller firms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Table 3 of the Economic Impact Statement indicates that about 85  percent of the private sector trash haulers are those with a fleet size  of about 10 trucks and have annual revenues under $1 million. These  might be classified as small business firms. All firms in the trash  hauling business would have two   possible problems associated with the ban: cost and time to retrofit,  and access to capital for retrofitting. The problem of raising capital  to retrofit should not be a burden to small firms unless they are denied  credit for factors not associated with this ban. The revised effective  date from 9 to 12 months will extend both the time to retrofit and the  time to search for capital sources, if necessary. We conclude that the  small firms in the trash hauling industry will not experience undue  hardship relative to their larger competitors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conclusion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission finds that this rule is  reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risks of  injury associated with refuse bins, as they are defined in Sec. 1301.4,  and which fail to meet the criteria specified in Sec. 1301.5</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on all of the above findings, the Commission finds that  the issuance of this rule is in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission is aware of the fact that refuse bins are used  for many years before being discarded. Estimates of their useful life  range from 10 to 15 years. Although other products which may be  hazardous may also have a long life in the hands of individual  consumers, a substantial number of unstable refuse bins remain in  commerce because they are rented or leased and are constantly available  for use by large numbers of consumers. The combination of the long life  of refuse bins plus the fact that unstable refuse bins could remain in  commerce and be available for use by many people, persuaded the  Commission to make this finding that no feasible consumer product safety  standard under the CPSA could adequately protect the public from the  unreasonable risk of injury associated with those unstable refuse bins  coming under the coverage of this ban.</p>
