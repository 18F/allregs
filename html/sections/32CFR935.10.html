                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The civil administration authority at Wake Island is vested in  the Secretary of the Air Force. That authority has been delegated to the  General Counsel of the Air Force with authority to redelegate all or any  part of his functions, powers, and duties under this part to such  officers and employees of the Air Force as he may designate, but  excluding redelegation of the power to promulgate, amend, or repeal this  part, or any part thereof. Such redelegation must be in writing and must  be in accordance with any applicable Secretary of the Air Force Orders.  Such redelegation may be further redelegated subject to such  restrictions as the delegating authority may impose. A redelegation may  also be made to a commissioned officer serving in another United States  military service who exercises military command, but such redelegation  must explicitly and specifically list the powers redelegated and shall  not include the power or authority to issue permits, licenses, or other  outgrants unless individually approved by the Air Force official who  made the redelegation. The Commander is the agent of the Secretary, his  delegate and designee when carrying out any function, power, or duty  assigned under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The authority of the General Counsel to appoint Judges shall not  be delegated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Judges and officers of the court may not redelegate their powers  or authorities except as specifically noted in this part.</p>
