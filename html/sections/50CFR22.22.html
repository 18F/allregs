                            <p class="depth0">We will issue a permit only to members of Indian entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs listed under 25 U.S.C. 479a-1 engaged in religious activities who satisfy all the issuance criteria of this section. We may, under the provisions of this section, issue a permit authorizing the taking, possession, and transportation within the United States, or transportation into or out of the United States of lawfully acquired bald eagles or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or eggs for Indian religious use. We will not issue a permit under this section that authorizes the transportation into or out of the United States of any live bald or golden eagles, or any live eggs of these birds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How do I apply if I want a permit for Indian religious purposes? You must submit applications for permits to take, possess, transport within the United States, or transport into or out of the United States lawfully acquired bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or eggs for Indian religious use to the appropriate Regional Director--Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the appropriate Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. If you are applying for a permit to transport into or out of the United States, your application must contain all the information necessary for the issuance of a CITES permit. You must comply with all the requirements in part 23 of this subchapter before international travel. Your application for any permit under this section must also contain the information required under this section, Sec.  13.12(a) of this subchapter, and the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Species and number of eagles or feathers proposed to be taken, or acquired by gift or inheritance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State and local area where the taking is proposed to be done, or from whom acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name of tribe with which applicant is associated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name of tribal religious ceremony(ies) for which required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must attach a certification of enrollment in an Indian tribe that is

federally recognized under the Federally Recognized Tribal List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a-1, 108 Stat. 4791 (1994). The certificate must be signed by the tribal official who is authorized to certify that an individual is a duly enrolled member of that tribe, and must include the official title of that certifying official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What are the permit conditions? In addition to the general conditions in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to take, possess, transport within the United States, or transport into or out of the United States bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests or eggs for Indian religious use are subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bald or golden eagles or their parts possessed under permits issued pursuant to this section are not transferable, except such birds or their parts may be handed down from generation to generation or from one Indian to another in accordance with tribal or religious customs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must submit reports or inventories, including photographs, of eagle feathers or parts on hand as requested by the issuing office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How do we evaluate your application for a permit? We will conduct an investigation and will only issue a permit to take, possess, transport within the United States, or transport into or out of the United States bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests or eggs, for Indian religious use when we determine that the taking, possession, or transportation is compatible with the preservation of the bald and golden eagle. In making a determination, we will consider, among other criteria, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The direct or indirect effect which issuing such permit would be likely to have upon the wild populations of bald or golden eagles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the applicant is an Indian who is authorized to participate in bona fide tribal religious ceremonies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> How long are the permits valid? We are authorized to amend, suspend, or revoke any permit that is issued under this section (see Sec. Sec.  13.23, 13.27, and 13.28 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A permit issued to you that authorizes you to take bald or golden eagles will be valid during the period specified on the face of the permit, but will not be longer than 1 year from the date it is issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A permit issued to you that authorizes you to transport and possess bald or golden eagles or their parts, nests, or eggs within the United States will be valid for your lifetime.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A permit authorizing you to transport dead bald eagles or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or dead eggs into or out of the United States can be used for multiple trips to or from the United States, but no trip can be longer than 180 days. The permit will be valid during the period specified on the face of the permit, not to exceed 3 years from the date it is issued.
