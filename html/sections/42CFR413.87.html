                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Statutory basis. This section implements section 1886(l) of the  Act, which provides for additional payments to hospitals that operate  and receive Medicare reasonable cost reimbursement for approved nursing  and allied health education programs and the methodology for determining  the additional payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the rules for determining an  additional payment amount to hospitals that receive payments for the  costs of operating approved nursing or allied health education programs  under Sec. 413.85.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The hospital must have received Medicare reasonable cost payment  for an approved nursing or allied health education program under Sec.  413.85 in its cost reporting period(s) ending in the fiscal year that is  2 years prior to the current calendar year. (For example, if the current  year is calendar year 2000, the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to  calendar year 2000 is FY 1998.) For a hospital that first establishes a  nursing or allied health education program after FY 1998 and receives  reasonable cost payment for the program as specified under Sec. 413.85  after FY 1998, the hospital is eligible to receive an additional payment  amount in a calendar year that is 2 years after the respective fiscal  year so long as the hospital also meets the condition under paragraph  (c)(1(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hospital must be receiving reasonable cost payment for an  approved nursing or allied health education program under Sec. 413.85  in the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after  January 1, 2001, in addition to meeting the conditions specified in  paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the hospital must  have had a Medicare + Choice utilization greater than zero in its cost  reporting period(s) ending in the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to  the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(4)</em> relating to calculating a proportional  reduction in Medicare + Choice direct GME payments, the additional  payment amount specified in paragraph (c) of this section is calculated  according to the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step one. Each calendar year, determine the hospital's total  nursing and allied health education program payments from its cost  reporting period(s) ending in the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to  the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step two. Determine the ratio of the hospital's payments from  step one to the total of all nursing and allied health education program  payments across all hospitals for all cost reporting periods ending in  the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step three. Multiply the ratio calculated in step two by the  Medicare + Choice nursing and allied health payment ``pool'' determined  in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section for the current  calendar year. The resulting product is each respective hospital's  additional payment amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculating the additional payment amount for portions of cost  reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 2001. For portions of  cost reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 2001, subject to  the provisions of Sec. 413.76(d) relating to calculating a proportional  reduction in Medicare + Choice direct GME payments, the additional  payment amount specified in paragraph (c) of this section is calculated  according to the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step one. Each calendar year, determine for each eligible  hospital the total--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medicare payments received for approved nursing or allied health  education programs based on data from the settled cost reports for the  period(s) ending in the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to the current  calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inpatient days for that same cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medicare + Choice inpatient days for that same cost reporting  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step two. Using the data from step one, determine the ratio of  the individual hospital's total nursing or allied health payments, to  its total inpatient days. Multiply this ratio by the hospital's total  Medicare + Choice inpatient days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step three. CMS will determine, using the best available data,  for all eligible hospitals the total of all--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nursing and allied health education program payments made to all  hospitals for all cost reporting periods ending in the fiscal year that  is 2 years prior to the current calendar year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inpatient days from those same cost reporting periods; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medicare + Choice inpatient days for those same cost reporting  periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step four. Using the data from step three, CMS will determine  the ratio of the total of all nursing and allied health education  program payments made to all hospitals for all cost reporting periods  ending in the fiscal year that is 2 years prior to the current calendar  year, to the total of all inpatient days from those same cost reporting  periods. CMS will multiply this ratio by the total of all Medicare +  Choice inpatient days for those same cost reporting periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Step 5. Calculate the ratio of the product determined in step  two to the product determined in step four.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Step 6. Multiply the ratio calculated in step five by the amount  determined in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section for the  current calendar year. The resulting product is each respective  hospital's additional payment amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section, each calendar year, CMS will calculate a  Medicare + Choice nursing and allied health payment ``pool'' according  to the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the ratio of projected total Medicare + Choice direct  GME payments made in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 413.76(c)  across all hospitals in the current calendar year to projected total  direct GME payments made across all hospitals in the current calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiply the ratio calculated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this  section by projected total Medicare nursing and allied health education  reasonable cost payments made to all hospitals in the current calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The resulting product of the steps under paragraphs (f)(1)(i)  and (f)(1)(ii) of this section is the Medicare + Choice nursing and  allied health payment ``pool'' for the current calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The payment pool may not exceed $60 million in any calendar  year.
