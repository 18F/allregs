                            <p class="depth0">Several provisions in the Act relate to appropriate mining  techniques or mining efficiency. These raise what could be characterized  as resource development issues. In particular, section 103(a)(2)(C)  requires a resource assessment to be provided with the recovery plan.  Section 103(a)(2)(D) of the Act provides that the applicant will select  the size and location of the area of a recovery plan, which will be  approved unless the Administrator finds that the area is not a ``logical  mining unit'' or the commercial recovery activities in the proposed site  would result in a significant adverse environmental effect which cannot  be avoided by the imposition of reasonable restrictions. Also, pursuant  to section 108 of the Act, the applicant's recovery plan and the TCRs of  each permit must be designed to ensure diligent development. In  addition, for the purpose of conservation of natural resources, section  110 of the Act provides that each permit is to contain, as needed,  terms, conditions, and restrictions which have due regard for the  prevention of waste and the future opportunity for the commercial  recovery of the unrecovered balance of the resources.</p>
