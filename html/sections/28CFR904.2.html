                            <p class="depth0">Compact Article IV(c) provides that ``Any record obtained under this Compact may be used only for the official purposes for which the record was requested.'' Further, Article III(b)(1)(C) requires that each Party State appoint a Compact officer who shall ``regulate the in-State use of records received by means of the III System from the FBI or from other Party States.'' To ensure compliance with this requirement, Compact Officers receiving records from the FBI or other Party States are specifically required to ``ensure that record entries that may not legally be used for a particular noncriminal justice purpose are deleted from the response and, if no information authorized for release remains, an appropriate `no record' response is communicated to the requesting official.''
