A hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is determined by adding the results of two computations and expressing that sum as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is determined by adding the results of two computations and expressing that sum as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> First computation: Federal fiscal year. For each month of the Federal fiscal year in which the hospital's cost reporting period begins, CMS--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determines the number of patient days that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Are associated with discharges occurring during each month; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Are furnished to patients who during that month were entitled to both Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)) and SSI, excluding those patients who received only State supplementation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adds the results for the whole period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Divides the number determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section by the total number of days that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Are associated with discharges that occur during that period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Are furnished to patients entitled to Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First computation: Cost reporting period. If a hospital prefers that CMS use its cost reporting period instead of the Federal fiscal year, it must furnish to CMS, through its intermediary, a written request including the hospital's name, provider number, and cost reporting period end date. This exception will be performed once per hospital per cost reporting period, and the resulting percentage becomes the hospital's official Medicare Part A/SSI percentage for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Second computation. The fiscal intermediary determines, for the same cost reporting period used for the first computation, the number of the hospital's patient days of service for which patients were eligible for Medicaid but not entitled to Medicare Part A, and divides that number by the total number of patient days in the same period. For purposes of this second computation, the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this computation, a patient is deemed eligible for Medicaid on a given day only if the patient is eligible for inpatient hospital services under an approved State Medicaid plan or under a waiver authorized under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act on that day, regardless of whether particular items or services were covered or paid under the State plan or the authorized waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective with discharges occurring on or after January 20, 2000, for purposes of counting days under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, hospitals may include all days attributable to populations eligible for Title XIX matching payments through a waiver approved under section 1115 of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The hospital has the burden of furnishing data adequate to prove eligibility for each Medicaid patient day claimed under this paragraph, and of verifying with the State that a patient was eligible for Medicaid during each claimed patient hospital day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2009, the hospital must report the days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation in a cost reporting period based on the date of discharge, the date of admission, or the dates of service. If a hospital seeks to change its methodology for reporting days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation, the hospital must notify CMS, through its fiscal intermediary or MAC, in writing at least 30 days before the beginning of the cost reporting period in which the change would apply. The written notification must specify the methodology the hospital will use, the cost reporting period to which the requested change would apply, and the current methodology being used. Such a change will be effective only on the first day of a cost reporting period. If a hospital changes its methodology for reporting such days, CMS or the fiscal intermediary or MAC may adjust the number of days reported for a cost reporting period if it determines that any of those days have been counted in a prior cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disproportionate patient percentage. The intermediary adds the results of the first computation made under either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section and the second computation made under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and expresses that sum as a percentage. This is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, and is used in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for classification. A hospital is classified as a ``disproportionate share'' hospital under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, as determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, is at least equal to one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area, and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area and has 500 or more beds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 30 percent for discharges occurring before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and either has more than 100 beds and fewer than 500 beds or is classified as a sole community hospital under Sec. 412.92.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 40 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has fewer than 100 beds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 45 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and has 100 or fewer beds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The hospital is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, and can demonstrate that, during its cost reporting period, more than 30 percent of its net inpatient care revenues are derived from State and local government payments for care furnished to indigent patients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment adjustment factor--(1) Method of adjustment.
