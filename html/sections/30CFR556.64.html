must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your application for approval of any instrument of transfer you are required to file (Record Title and/or Operating Rights (Transfer) Fee). Where multiple transfers of interest are included in a single instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of interest. For any document you are not required to file by these regulations but which you submit for record purposes, you must also pay electronically through Pay.gov the service fee listed in Sec.  556.63 (Non-required Document Filing Fee) per lease affected, and you must include a copy of the Pay.gov confirmation receipt page with your document. Such documents may be rejected at the discretion of the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An attorney in fact, in behalf of the holder of a lease, operating rights or sublease, shall furnish evidence of authority to execute the assignment or application for approval and the statement required by Sec.  556.46 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When you request approval for an assignment that assigns all your record title interest in a lease or that creates a segregated lease, your assignee must furnish a bond in the amount prescribed in Sec. Sec.  556.52 and 556.53 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When you request approval for an assignment that assigns less than all the record title of a lease and that does not create a separate lease, the assignee may, with the surety's consent, become a joint principal on the surety instrument that guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease, or any interest therein, shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such lease or interest, if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is furnished in the form of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court having jurisdiction of the distribution of the estate or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no court action is necessary, the statements of two disinterested parties having knowledge of the facts or a certified copy of the will.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the heirs or devisees shall file statements that they are the persons named as successors to the estate with evidence of their qualifications as provided in Sec.  556.46 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In the event an heir or devisee is unable to qualify to hold the lease or interest, the heir or devisee shall be recognized as the lawful successor of the deceased and be entitled to hold the lease for a period of not to exceed 2 years from the date of death of the predecessor in interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Your heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns are bound to comply with each obligation under any lease and under the regulations in this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are jointly and severally liable for the performance of each nonmonetary obligation under the lease and under the regulations in this chapter with each prior lessee and with each operating rights owner holding an interest at the time the obligation accrued, unless this chapter provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sublessees and operating rights owners are jointly and severally liable for the performance of each nonmonetary obligation under the lease and under the regulations in this chapter to the extent that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The obligation relates to the area embraced by the sublease;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Those owners held their respective interest at the time the obligation accrued; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This chapter does not provide otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Where the proposed assignment or transfer is by a person who, at the time of acquisition of an interest in the lease, was on the List of Restricted Joint Bidders, and that assignment or transfer is of less than the entire interest of the assignor or transferor, to a person or persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders, the assignor or transferor shall file a copy, prior to approval of the assignment, of all agreements applicable to the acquisition of that lease or a fractional interest.</p>
