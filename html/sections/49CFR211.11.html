Each petition for rulemaking filed as prescribed in Secs. 211.7 and 211.9 is referred to the head of the office responsible for the subject matter of the petition to review and recommend appropriate action to the Administrator. No public hearing or oral argument is held before the Administrator decides whether the petition should be granted. However, a notice may be published in the Federal Register inviting written comments concerning the petition. Each petition shall be granted or denied not later than six months after its receipt by the Docket Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grants. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking petition complies with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 and that rulemaking is justified, he initiates a rulemaking proceeding by publishing an advance notice or notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Denials. If the Administrator determines that a rulemaking petition does not comply with the requirements of Sec. 211.9 or that rulemaking is not justified, he denies the petition. If the petition pertains to railroad safety, the Administrator may also initiate an informal safety inquiry under Sec. 211.61.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification; closing of docket. Whenever the Administrator grants or denies a rulemaking petition, a notice of the grant or denial is mailed to the petitioner. If the petition is denied, the proceeding is terminated and the docket for that petition is closed.</p>
