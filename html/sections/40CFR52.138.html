The purpose of this regulation is to provide procedures as part of the Arizona carbon monoxide implementation plans for metropolitan transportation planning organizations (MPOs) to use when determining conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects. Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) prohibits MPOs from approving any project, program, or plan which does not conform to an implementation plan approved or promulgated under section 110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable implementation plan or applicable plan means the portion (or portions) of the implementation plan, or most recent revision thereof, which has been approved under section 110 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410, or promulgated under section 110(c) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7410(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carbon monoxide national ambient air quality standard (CO NAAQS) means the standards for carbon monoxide promulgated by the Administrator under section 109, 42 U.S.C. 7409, of the Clean Air Act and found in 40 CFR 50.8</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cause means resulting in a violation of the CO NAAQS in an area which previously did not have ambient CO concentrations above the CO NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contribute means resulting in measurably higher average 8-hour ambient CO concentrations over the NAAQS or an increased number of violations of the NAAQS in an area which currently experiences CO levels above the standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) means the organization designated under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 23 CFR part 450.106.

UPWPs are also known as overallwork programs or OWPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. These procedures shall apply only to the Maricopa Association of Governments in its role as the designated metropolitan planning organization for Maricopa County, Arizona, and the Pima Association of Governments in its role as the designated metropolitan planning organization for Pima County, Arizona.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures--(1) Transportation Plans and Transportation Improvement Programs--(i) Documentation.

The MPO shall prepare for each transportation plan and program (except for the unified planning work program), as part of the plan or program, a report documenting for each plan and program the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Documentation. The MPO shall prepare for each transportation plan and program (except for the unified planning work program), as part of the plan or program, a report documenting for each plan and program the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> the disaggregated population projections and employment which were assumed in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the applicable plan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the transportation plan/program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> the levels of vehicle trips, vehicle miles traveled, and congestion that were:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> assumed in the applicable plan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> expected to result from the implementation of the plan/program over the period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to result from the implementation of the plan/program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> for each major transportation control measure in the applicable implementation plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the TCM's implementation schedule and, if determined in the applicable plan, expected effectiveness in reducing CO emissions,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the TCM's current implementation status and, if feasible, its current effectiveness in reducing CO emissions, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> actions in the plan/program which may beneficially or adversely affect the implementation and/or effectiveness of the TCM;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> the CO emission levels resulting from the implementation of the plan/program over the period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to result from the implementation of the plan/program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> the ambient CO concentration levels, micro-scale and regional, resulting from the implementation of the plan/program over the period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to result from the implementation of the plan or program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Findings. Prior to approving a transportation plan/program, the MPO shall determine if the plan/program conforms to the applicable implementation plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make and support each of the following findings for each transportation plan and program using the information documented in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> that implementation of the transportation plan/program will provide for the implementation of TCMs in the applicable plan on the schedule set forth in the applicable plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from the implementation of the plan/program will not delay attainment or achievement of any interim emission reductions needed for attainment and/or interfere with maintenance of the CONAAQS throughout the nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> that implementation of the plan/program would not cause or contribute to a violation of the CO NAAQS anywhere within the nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amendments to a Transportation Plan or Transportation Implementation Program.
