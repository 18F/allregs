                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Coast Guard receives evidence of grounds for termination of acceptance or recognition of an independent laboratory under Sec. 159.010-17, the Commandant will notify the laboratory that termination is under consideration. The laboratory may submit written comments to the Commandant within 21 days of receipt of the notification. The Commandant will take all timely written comments into account

before taking final action in the matter, and in no case will the Commandant take final action until at least 30 days after the laboratory has received the notification. Any final action taken by the Commandant is final agency action on the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a deficiency could materially affect the validity of an approval issued under an applicable subpart, the Commandant may temporarily suspend the acceptance of the laboratory and may direct the holder of the certificate of approval to cease claiming that the items tested or inspected by the laboratory are Coast Guard approved, pending a final decision in the matter.
