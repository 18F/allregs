                            <p class="depth0">Subsection (b)(3)(B) of section 1202 of the Social Security Act  permits a State to delay payment of interest accrued on advances made  during the last five months of the Federal fiscal year (May, June, July,  August, and September) to no later than December 31 of the next  succeeding calendar year. If the payment is delayed, interest on the  delayed payment will accrue from the normal due date (i.e., September  30) and in the same manner as if the interest due on the advance(s) was  an advance made on such due date. The Governor of a State which has  decided to delay such interest payment shall notify the Secretary of  Labor no later than September 1 of the year with respect to which the  delay is applicable.</p>
