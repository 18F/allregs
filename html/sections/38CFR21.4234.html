Circumstances beyond the control of the  veteran, reservist, or eligible person include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The course being discontinued by the school when no other  similar course leading to the same objective is available within normal  commuting distance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unexpected financial difficulties preventing completion of the  last program because of the overall cost of the program needed to reach  the objective, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The veteran, reservist, or eligible person being required to  relocate because of health reasons in an area where training for the  last objective is not available within normal commuting distance.

If the applicable provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of  this section are met, VA will approve the change of program. VA will not  apply any of the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section in  determining whether the change of program should be approved.

For  example, an eligible person enrolled for a bachelor of science degree  may show a professional objective such as chemist, teacher or engineer.  His or her objective for purposes of this paragraph shall be considered  to be ``bachelor degree'' and any change of courses will be considered  only an adjustment in the program, not a change, so long as the subjects  he or she pursues lead to the bachelor degree and there is no extension  of time in the attaining of that degree.
