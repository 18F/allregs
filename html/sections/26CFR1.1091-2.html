                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The application of section 1091(d) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A purchased a share of common stock of the X Corporation for $100 in 1935, which he sold January 15, 1955, for $80. On February 1, 1955, he purchased a share of common stock of the same corporation for $90. No loss from the sale is recognized under section 1091. The basis of the new share is $110; that is, the basis of the old share ($100) increased by $10, the excess of the price at which the new share was acquired ($90) over the price at which the old share was sold ($80).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A purchased a share of common stock of the Y Corporation for $100 in 1935, which he sold January 15, 1955, for $80. On February 1, 1955, he purchased a share of common stock of the same corporation for $70. No loss from the sale is recognized under section 1091. The basis of the new share is $90; that is, the basis of the old share ($100) decreased by $10, the excess of the price at which the old share was sold ($80) over the price at which the new share was acquired ($70).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rule. For a special rule as to the adjustment to basis required under section 1091(d) in the case of wash sales involving certain regulated investment company stock for which there is an average basis, see paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (c) and (d) of Sec. 1.1012-1.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7129, 36 FR 12738, July 7, 1971]


Sec. 1.1092(b)-1T  Coordination of loss deferral rules and wash salerules (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided, in the case of the disposition of a position or positions of a straddle, the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply before the application of the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any loss sustained from the disposition of shares of stock or securities that constitute positions of a straddle shall not be taken into account for purposes of this subtitle if, within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such disposition and ending 30 days after such date, the taxpayer has acquired (by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by law), or has entered into a contract or option so to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided, if a taxpayer disposes of less than all of the positions of a straddle, any loss sustained with respect to the disposition of that position or positions (hereinafter referred to as loss position) shall not be taken into account for purposes of this subtitle to the extent that the amount of unrecognized gain as of the close of the taxable year in one or more of the following positions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Successor positions,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offsetting positions to the loss position, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Offsetting positions to any successor position,
exceeds the amount of loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. See Sec. 1.1092(b)-5T relating to definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Carryover of disallowed loss. Any loss that is disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section shall, subject to any further application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the limitations under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, be treated as sustained in the succeeding taxable year. However, a loss disallowed in Year 1, for example, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section

will not be allowed in Year 2 unless the substantially identical stock or securities, the acquisition of which caused the loss to be disallowed in Year 1, are disposed of during Year 2 and paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section do not apply in Year 2 to disallow the loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of disallowed loss--(1) Character. If the disposition of a loss position would (but for the application of this section) result in a capital loss, the loss allowed under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the disposition of the loss position shall be treated as a capital loss. In any other case, a loss allowed under paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as an ordinary loss. For example, if the disposition of a loss position would, but for the application of paragraph (a) of this section, give rise to a capital loss, that loss when allowed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as a capital loss on the date the loss is allowed regardless of whether any gain or loss with respect to one or more successor positions would be treated as ordinary income or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Character. If the disposition of a loss position would (but for the application of this section) result in a capital loss, the loss allowed under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the disposition of the loss position shall be treated as a capital loss. In any other case, a loss allowed under paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as an ordinary loss. For example, if the disposition of a loss position would, but for the application of paragraph (a) of this section, give rise to a capital loss, that loss when allowed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as a capital loss on the date the loss is allowed regardless of whether any gain or loss with respect to one or more successor positions would be treated as ordinary income or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 1256 contracts. If the disposition of a loss position would (but for the application of this section) result in 60 percent long-term capital loss and 40 percent short-term capital loss, the loss allowed under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the disposition of the loss position shall be treated as 60 percent long-term capital loss and 40 percent short-term capital loss regardless of whether any gain or loss with respect to one or more successor positions would be treated as 100 percent long-term or short-term capital gain or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. (1) This section shall not apply to losses sustained--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This section shall not apply to losses sustained--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the disposition of one or more positions that constitute part of a hedging transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the disposition of a loss position included in a mixed straddle account (as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1092(b)-4T); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to the disposition of a position that is part of a straddle consisting only of section 1256 contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to losses sustained by a dealer in stock or securities if such losses are sustained in a transaction made in the ordinary course of such business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coordination with section 1091. Section 1092(b) applies in lieu of section 1091 to losses sustained from the disposition of positions in a straddle. See example (18) of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section apply to dispositions of loss positions on or after January 24, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the following positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year and none of the exceptions contained in paragraph (d) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. On December 10, 1985, A disposes of the short position at an $11 loss, at which time there is $5 of unrealized gain in the offsetting long position. At year-end there is still $5 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position. Under these circumstances, $5 of the $11 loss will be disallowed for 1985 because there is $5 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position; the remaining $6 of loss, however, will be taken into account in 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except that at year-end there is $11 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position. Under these circumstances, the entire $11 loss will be disallowed for 1985 because there is $11 of unrecognized gain at year-end in the offsetting long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except that at year-end there is no unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position. Under these circumstances, the entire $11 loss will be allowed for 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On November 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. On November 10, 1985, A disposes of the long position at a $10 loss, at which time there is $10 of unrealized gain in the short position. On November 11, 1985, A enters into a new long position (successor position) that is offsetting with respect to the retained short position but is not substantially identical to the long position disposed of on November 10, 1985. A holds both positions through year-

end, at which time there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position and no unrecognized gain in the offsetting short position. Under these circumstances, the entire $10 loss will be disallowed for 1985 because there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the facts are the same as in example (4), except that at year-end there is $4 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position and $6 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting short position. Under these circumstances, the entire $10 loss will be disallowed for 1985 because there is a total of $10 of unrecognized gain in both the successor long position and offsetting short position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the facts are the same as in example (4), except that at year-end A disposes of the offsetting short position at a $2 loss. Under these circumstances, $10 of the total $12 loss will be disallowed because there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Assume the facts are the same as in example (4), and on January 10, 1986, A disposes of the successor long position at no gain or loss. A holds the offsetting short position until year-end, at which time there is $10 of unrecognized gain. Under these circumstances, the $10 loss will be disallowed for 1986 because there is $10 of unrecognized gain in an offsetting position at year-end.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the facts are the same as in example (4), except at year-end there is $8 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position and $8 of unrecognized loss in the offsetting short position. Under these circumstances, $8 of the total $10 realized loss will be disallowed because there is $8 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. On October 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. Neither the long nor the short position is stock or securities. On October 2, 1985, A disposes of the short position at a $10 loss and the long position at a $10 gain. On October 3, 1985, A enters into a long position identical to the original long position. At year-end there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the second long position. Under these circumstances, the $10 loss is allowed because the second long position is not a successor position or offsetting position to the short loss position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. On November 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. On November 10, 1985, there is $20 of unrealized gain in the long position and A disposes of the short position at a $20 loss. By November 15, 1985, the value of the long position has declined eliminating all unrealized gain in the position. On November 15, 1985, A establishes a second short position (successor position) that is offsetting with respect to the long position but is not substantially identical to the short position disposed of on November 10, 1985. At year-end there is no unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position or in the successor short position. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss sustained with respect to the short loss position will be allowed for 1985 because at year-end there is no unrecognized gain in the successor short position or the offsetting long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Assume the facts are the same as in example (10), except that the second short position was established on November 8, 1985, and there is $20 of unrecognized gain in the second short position at year-end. Since the second short position was entered into within 30 days before the disposition of the loss position, the second short position is considered a successor position to the loss position. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss will be disallowed because there is $20 of unrecognized gain in a successor position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Assume the facts are the same as in example (10), except that at year-end there is $18 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position and $18 of unrecognized gain in the successor short position. Under these circumstances, the entire loss will be disallowed because there is more than $20 of unrecognized gain in both the successor short position and offsetting long position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. Assume the facts are the same as in example (10), except that there is $20 of unrecognized gain in the successor short position and no unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position at year-end. Under these circumstances, the entire $20 loss will be disallowed because there is $20 of unrecognized gain in the successor short position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. On January 2, 1986, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. Neither the long nor the short position is stock or securities. On March 3, 1986, A disposes of the long position at a $10 gain. On March 10, 1986, A disposes of the short position at a $10 loss. On March 14, 1986, A enters into a new short position. On April 10, 1986, A enters into an offsetting long position. A holds both positions to year-end, at which time there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position and no unrecognized gain or loss in the short position. Under these circumstances, the $10 loss will be allowed because (1) the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not applicable; and (2) the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section do not apply, since all positions of the straddle that contained the loss position were disposed of.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. On December 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting long and short positions. On December 4, 1985, A disposes of the short position at a $10 loss. On December 5, 1985, A establishes a new short position that is offsetting to the long position, but is not substantially identical to the short position disposed of on December 4, 1985. On December 6, 1985, A disposes of the long position at a $10 gain. On December 7, 1985, A enters into a second long position that is offsetting to the

new short position, but is not substantially identical to the long position disposed of on December 6, 1985. A holds both positions to year-end at which time there is no unrecognized gain in the second short position and $10 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting long position. Under these circumstances, the entire $10 loss will be disallowed for the 1985 taxable year because the second long position is an offsetting position with respect to the second short position which is a successor position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. On September 1, 1985, A enters into offsetting positions consisting of a long section 1256 contract and short non-section 1256 position. No elections under sections 1256(d)(1) or 1092(b)(2)(A), relating to mixed straddles, are made. On November 1, 1985, at which time there is $20 of unrecognized gain in the short non-section 1256 position, A disposes of the long section 1256 contract at a $20 loss and on the same day acquires a long non-section 1256 position (successor position) that is offsetting with respect to the short non-section 1256 position. But for the application of this section, A's disposition of the section 1256 contract would give rise to a capital loss. At year-end there is a $20 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting short non-section 1256 position and no unrecognized gain in the successor long position. Under these circumstances, the entire $20 loss will be disallowed for 1985 because there is $20 unrecognized gain in the offsetting short position. In 1986, A disposes of the successor long non-section 1256 position and there is no unrecognized gain at year-end in the offsetting short position. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss disallowed in 1985 with respect to the section 1256 contract will be treated in 1986 as 60 percent long-term capital loss and 40 percent short-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. On January 2, 1986, A, not a dealer in stock or securities, acquires stock in X Corporation (X stock) and an offsetting put option. On March 3, 1986, A disposes of the X stock at a $10 loss. On March 10, 1986, A disposes of the put option at a $10 gain. On March 14, 1986, A acquires new X stock that is substantially identical to the X stock disposed of on March 3, 1986. A holds the X stock to year-end. Under these circumstances, the $10 loss will be disallowed for 1986 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because A, within a period beginning 30 days before March 3, 1986 and ending 30 days after such date, acquired stock substantially identical to the X stock disposed of.</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. On June 2, 1986, A, not a dealer in stock or securities, acquires stock in X Corporation (X stock). On September 2, 1986, A disposes of the X stock at a $100 loss. On September 15, 1986, A acquires new X stock that is substantially identical to the X stock disposed of on September 2, 1986, and an offsetting put option. A holds these straddle positions to year-end. Under these circumstances, section 1091, rather than section 1092(b), will apply to disallow the $100 loss for 1986 because the loss was not sustained from the disposition of a position that was part of a straddle. See paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. On November 1, 1985, A, not a dealer in stock or securities, acquires stock in Y Corporation (Y stock) and an offsetting put option. On November 12, 1985, there is $20 of unrealized gain in the put option and A disposes of the Y stock at a $20 loss. By November 15, 1985, the value of the put option has declined eliminating all unrealized gain in the position. On November 15, 1985, A acquires a second Y stock position that is substantially identical to the Y stock disposed of on November 12, 1985. At year-end there is no unrecognized gain in the put option or the Y stock. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss will be disallowed for 1985 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because A, within a period beginning 30 days before November 12, 1985 and ending 30 days after such date, acquired stock substantially identical to the Y stock disposed of.</p><p class="depth0">Example 20. Assume the facts are the same as in Example 19 and that on December 31, 1986, A disposes of the put option at a $40 gain and there is $20 of unrecognized loss in the Y stock. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss which was disallowed in 1985 also will be disallowed for 1986 under the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section because A has not disposed of the stock substantially identical to the Y stock disposed of on November 12, 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 21. Assume the facts are the same as in example (19), except that on December 31, 1986, A disposes of the Y stock at a $20 loss and there is $40 of unrecognized gain in the put option. Under these circumstances, A will not recognize in 1986 either the $20 loss disallowed in 1985 or the $20 loss sustained with respect to the December 31, 1986 disposition of Y stock. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to disallow the losses in 1986 since the substantially identical Y stock was disposed of during the year (and no substantially identical stock or securities was acquired by A within the 61 day period). However, paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies to disallow for 1986 the $40 of losses sustained with respect to the dispositions of positions in the straddle because there is $40 of unrecognized gain in the put option, an offsetting position to the loss positions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 22. On January 2, 1986, A, not a dealer in stock or securities, acquires stock in X Corporation (X stock) and an offsetting put option. On March 3, 1986, A disposes of the X stock at a $10 loss. On March 17, 1986, A acquires new X stock that is substantially identical to the X stock disposed of on March 3, 1986. On December 31, 1986, A disposes of the X stock at a $5 gain, at which time there is $5 of unrecognized gain in the put option.

Under these circumstances, the $10 loss sustained with respect to the March 3, 1986, disposition of X stock will be allowed under paragraph (a) (1) of this section since the substantially identical X stock acquired on March 17, 1986, was disposed of by year-end (and no substantially identical stock or securities were acquired by A within the 61 day period). However, $5 of the $10 loss will be disallowed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section because there is $5 of unrecognized gain in the put option, an offsetting position to the loss position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 23. Assume the facts are the same as in example (22), except that on December 31, 1986, A disposes of the offsetting put option at a $5 loss and there is $5 of unrecognized gain in the X stock acquired on March 17, 1986. Under these circumstances, the $10 loss sustained with respect to the X stock disposed of on March 3, 1986, will be disallowed for 1986 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The $5 loss sustained upon the disposition of the put option will be allowed because (1) the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not applicable; and (2) the rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this section allow the loss, since the unrecognized gain in the X stock ($5) is not in excess of the loss ($10) disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 24. On January 2, 1986, A, not a dealer in stock or securities, acquires 200 shares of Z Corporation stock (Z stock) and 2 put options on Z stock (giving A the right to sell 200 shares of Z stock). On September 2, 1986, there is $200 of unrealized gain in the put option positions and A disposes of the 200 shares of Z stock at a $200 loss. On September 10, 1986, A acquires 100 shares of Z stock (substantially identical to the Z stock disposed of on September 2, 1986), and a call option that is offsetting to the put options on Z stock and that is not an option to acquire property substantially identical to the Z stock disposed of on September 2, 1986. At year-end, there is $80 of unrecognized gain in the Z stock position, $80 of unrecognized gain in the call option position, and no unrecognized gain or loss in the offsetting put option positions. Under these circumstances, $40 of the $200 loss sustained with respect to the September 2, 1986 disposition of Z stock will be recognized by A in 1986 under paragraph (a) of this section, as set forth below. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies first to disallow $100 of the loss (\1/2\ of the loss), since 100 shares of substantially identical Z stock (\1/2\ of the stock) were acquired within the 61 day period. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section then applies to disallow that portion of the loss allowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($200-$100=$100) equal to the excess of the total unrecognized gain in the Z stock and call option positions (successor positions to the loss position) ($80+$80=$160) over the $100 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($160-$100=$60; $100-$60=$40).</p><p class="depth0">Example 25. Assume the facts are the same as in example (24), except that at year-end there is $110 of unrecognized gain in the Z stock position, $78 of unrecognized gain in the call option position, and $10 of unrecognized gain in the offsetting put option positions. Under these circumstances, $2 of the $200 loss sustained with respect to the September 2, 1986 disposition of Z stock will be allowed in 1986 under paragraph (a) of this section, as set forth below. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies first to disallow $100 of the loss (\1/2\ of the loss) since 100 shares of substantially identical Z stock (\1/2\ of the stock) were acquired within the 61 day period. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section then applies to disallow that portion of the loss allowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($200-$100=$100) equal to the excess of the total unrecognized gain in the Z stock and call option positions (successor positions to the loss position) and the put option positions (offsetting positions to the loss position) ($110+$78+$10=$198) over the $100 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($198-$100=$98; $100-$98=$2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 26. Assume the facts are the same as in example (24), except that at year-end there is $120 of unrecognized gain in the Z stock position, $88 of unrecognized gain in the call option position, and $10 of unrecognized loss in one of the offsetting put option positions. At year-end A disposes of the other put option position at a $10 loss. Under these circumstances, $2 of the $210 loss sustained with respect to the September 2, 1986 disposition of Z stock ($200) and the year-end disposition of a put option ($10) will be allowed in 1986 under paragraph (a) of this section, as set forth below. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies first to disallow $100 of the loss from the disposition of Z stock (\1/2\ of the loss), since 100 shares of substantially identical Z stock (\1/2\ of the stock) were acquired within the 61 day period. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section then applies to disallow that portion of the loss allowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($210-$100=$110) equal to the excess of the total unrecognized gain in the Z stock and call option positions (successor positions to the Z stock loss position, and offsetting positions to the put option loss position) ($120+$88=$208) over the $100 loss disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($208-$100=$108; $110-$108=$2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 27. On January 27, 1986, A enters into offsetting long (L1) and short (S1) positions. Neither L1 nor S1 nor any other positions entered into by A in 1986 are stock or securities. On February 3, 1986, A disposes of L1 at a $10 loss. On February 5, 1986, A enters into a new long position (L2) that is offsetting to S1. On October 15, 1986, A disposes of

S1 at an $11 loss. On October 17, 1986, A enters into a new short position (S2) that is offsetting to L2. On December 30, 1986, A disposes of L2 at a $12 loss. On December 31, 1986, A enters into a new long position (L3) that is offsetting to S2. At year-end, S2 has an unrecognized gain of $33. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply since none of the positions were shares of stock or securities. However, all $33 ($10+$11+$12) of the losses sustained with respect to L1, S1 and L2 will be disallowed under paragraph (a)(2) because there is $33 of unrecognized gain in S2 at year-end. The $10 loss from the disposition of L1 is disallowed because S2 is or was an offsetting position to a successor long position (L2 or L3). The $11 loss from the disposition of S1 is disallowed because S2 is a successor position to S1. The $12 loss from the disposition of L2 is disallowed because S2 was an offsetting position to L2.

On October 1, 1984, A acquires gold. On January 1, 1985, A enters into an offsetting short gold forward contract. On April 1, 1985, A disposes of the short gold forward contract at no gain or loss. On April 10, 1985, A sells the gold at a gain. Since the gold had not been held for more than 6 months before the offsetting short position was entered into, the holding period for the gold begins no earlier than the time the straddle is terminated. Thus, the holding period of the original gold purchased on October 1, 1984, and sold on April 10, 1985, begins on April 1, 1985, the date the straddle was terminated. Consequently, gain recognized with respect to the gold will be treated as short-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1985, A enters into a long gold forward contract. On May 1, 1985, A enters into an offsetting short gold regulated futures contract. A does not make an election under section 1256(d) or 1092(b)(2)(A). On August 1, 1985, A disposes of the gold forward contract at a gain. Since the forward contract had not been held by A for more than 6 months prior to the establishment of the straddle, the holding period for the forward contract begins no earlier than the time the straddle is terminated. Thus, the gain recognized on the closing of the gold forward contract will be treated as short-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the facts are the same as in example (2), except that A disposes of the short gold regulated futures contract on July 1, 1985, at no gain or loss and the forward contract on November 1, 1985. Since the forward contract had not been held for more than 6 months before the mixed straddle was established, the holding period for the forward contract begins July 1, 1985, the date the straddle terminated. Thus, the gain recognized on the closing of the forward contract will be treated as short-term capital gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On January 1, 1985, A enters into a long gold forward contract and on August 4, 1985, A enters into an offsetting short gold forward contract. On September 1, 1985, A disposes of the short position at a loss. Since an offsetting long position had been held by A for more than 6 months prior to the acquisition of the offsetting short position, the loss with respect to the closing of the short position will be treated as long-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On March 1, 1985, A enters into a long gold forward contract and on July 17, 1985, A enters into an offsetting short gold regulated futures contract. A does not make an election under section 1256(d) or 1092(b)(2)(A). On August 10, 1985, A disposes of the long gold forward contract at a loss. Since the gold forward contract was part of a mixed straddle, and the disposition of no position in the straddle (other than the regulated futures contract) would give rise to a long-term capital loss, the loss recognized on the termination of the gold forward contract will be treated as 40 percent short-term capital loss and 60 percent long-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the facts are the same as in example (5), except that on August 11, 1985, A disposes of the short gold regulated futures contract at a gain.

Assume the facts are the same as in example (5), except that A enters into the long gold forward contract on January 1, 1985, and does not dispose of the long gold forward contract but instead on August 10, 1985, disposes of the short gold regulated futures contract at a loss. Under these circumstances, the loss will be treated as a long-term capital loss since A held an offsetting non-section 1256 position for more than 6 months prior to the establishment of the

straddle. However, such loss may be subject to the rules of Sec. 1.1092(b)-1T.

In addition, because none of the $100 unrealized gain from the remaining section 1256 contract was offset against gain or loss on the non-section 1256 positions, no adjustment is made under paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the entire $150 gain on December 31 with respect to that contract is realized on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All of the section 1256 contracts of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle disposed of on the same day.

The net gain of $500 from the straddle will be treated as 60 percent long-term capital gain and 40 percent short-term capital gain because it is attributable to the section 1256 contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except that A realized a $1,000 loss on the section 1256 contract and there is $1,000 of unrecognized gain on the non-section 1256 position. Under these circumstances, the $1,000 loss on the section 1256 contract will be treated as short-term

capital loss because there is a $1,000 gain on the non-section 1256 position. Such loss, however, will be disallowed in 1985 under the loss deferral rules of section 1092(a) because there is $1,000 of unrecognized gain in an offsetting position at year-end. See paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except that the section 1256 contract and non-section 1256 position were entered into on December 1, 1985, and the section 1256 contract is disposed of on December 19, 1985, for a $1,000 gain, at which time there is $1,000 of unrealized loss on the non-section 1256 position. At year-end there is only $800 of unrealized loss in the non-section 1256 position. Under these circumstances, the result is the same as in example (1) because there was $1,000 of unrealized loss on the non-section 1256 position at the time of the disposition of the section 1256 contract.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On July 15, 1985, A enters into a straddle consisting of two non-section 1256 positions and two section 1256 contracts and makes a valid election to treat such straddle as a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle. On July 20, 1985, A disposes of one non-section 1256 position at a gain of $1,000 and both section 1256 contracts at a net loss of $1,000. On the same day there is $200 of unrealized loss on the non-section 1256 position retained by A. Under these circumstances, realized and unrealized gain and loss with respect to the non-section 1256 positions is netted, resulting in a net gain of $800. Thus, $800 of the net loss on the section 1256 contracts disposed of will be treated as short-term capital loss because there is $800 of net gain on the non-section 1256 positions. In addition, the net loss of $200 from the straddle will be treated as 60 percent long-term capital loss and 40 percent short-term capital loss because it is attributable to the section 1256 contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disposition of one or more, but not all, positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle on the same day. If one or more, but not all, of the positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of on the same day, and paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section are not applicable (without regard to this paragraph (b)(5)), the gain and loss from the non-section 1256 positions that are disposed of on that day shall be netted, and the gain and loss from the section 1256 contracts that are disposed of on that day shall be netted. In order to determine whether the rules of paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section apply, net gain or loss from the section 1256 contracts disposed of shall then be offset against net gain or loss from the non-section 1256 positions disposed of to determine net gain or loss from such positions of the straddle. If net gain or loss from the disposition of such positions of the straddle is attributable to the non-section 1256 positions disposed of, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. If net gain or loss from the disposition of such positions is attributable to the section 1256 contracts disposed of, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section apply. If the net gain or loss from the netting of non-section 1256 positions disposed of and the netting of section 1256 contracts disposed of are either both gains or losses, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply to net gain or loss from such non-section 1256 positions, and the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall apply to net gain or loss from such section 1256 contracts. However, for purposes of determining the treatment of gain or loss subsequently realized on a position of such straddle, to the extent that unrealized gain or loss on other positions was used to offset realized gain or loss on a non-section 1256 position under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or was used to treat realized gain or loss on a section 1256 contract as short-term capital gain or loss under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, such amount shall not be used for such purposes again. This paragraph (b)(5) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On July 15, 1985, A enters into a straddle consisting of four non-section 1256 positions and four section 1256 contracts and makes a valid election to treat such straddle as a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle. On July 20, 1985, A disposes of one non-section 1256 position at a gain of $800 and one section 1256 contract at a loss of $300. On the same day there is $400 of unrealized net loss on the section 1256 contracts retained by A and $100 of unrealized net loss on the non-section 1256 positions retained by A. Under these circumstances, the loss of $300 on the

section 1256 contract disposed of will be offset against the gain of $800 on the non-section 1256 position disposed of. The net gain of $500 is attributable to the non-section 1256 position. Therefore, the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. Under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the net loss of $700 on the section 1256 contracts is offset against the net gain of $800 attributable to the non-section 1256 position disposed of. The net gain of $100 will be treated as short-term capital gain because it is attributable to the non-section 1256 position disposed of.

Under these circumstances, the gain of $300 on the non-section 1256 position disposed of will be offset against the loss of $800 on the section 1256 contract disposed of. The net loss of $500 is attributable to the section 1256 contract. Therefore, the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section apply. Under the rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, $500 of the net loss realized on the section 1256 contract will be treated as short-term capital loss because there is $500 of realized and unrealized gain in the non-section 1256 positions. The remaining net loss of $300 will be treated as 60 percent long-term capital loss and 40 percent short-term capital loss because it is attributable to a section 1256 contract disposed of.

Sec. 1.1092(b)-4T  Mixed straddles; mixed straddle account (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer may elect (in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section) to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). Gains and losses from positions includible in a mixed straddle account shall be determined and treated in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. A mixed straddle account is treated as established as of the first day of the taxable year for which the taxpayer makes the election or

January 1, 1984, whichever is later. See Sec. 1.1092(b)-5T relating to definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Mixed straddle account defined--(1) In general. The term mixed straddle account means an account for determining gains and losses from all positions held as capital assets in a designated class of activities by the taxpayer at the time the taxpayer elects to establish a mixed straddle account. A separate mixed straddle account must be established for each separate designated class of activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term mixed straddle account means an account for determining gains and losses from all positions held as capital assets in a designated class of activities by the taxpayer at the time the taxpayer elects to establish a mixed straddle account. A separate mixed straddle account must be established for each separate designated class of activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permissible designations. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a taxpayer may designate as a class of activities the types of positions that a reasonable person, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, would ordinarily expect to be offsetting positions. This paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by the following example. It is assumed in the example that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) during the taxable year, and that gain or loss from the positions is treated as gain or loss from a capital asset.</p><p class="depth0">Example: B engages in transactions in dealer equity options on XYZ Corporation stock, stock in XYZ Corporation, dealer equity options on UVW Corporation stock, and stock in UVW Corporation. A reasonable person, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, would not expect dealer equity options on XYZ Corporation stock and stock in XYZ Corporation to offset any dealer equity options on UVW Corporation stock or any stock in UVW Corporation. If B makes the mixed straddle account election under this section for all such positions, B must designate two separate classes of activities, one consisting of transactions in dealer equity options on XYZ Corporation stock and stock in XYZ Corporation, and the other consisting of transactions in dealer equity options on UVW Corporation stock and stock in UVW Corporation, and maintain two separate mixed straddle accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Positions that offset positions in more than one mixed straddle account. Gains and losses from positions that a reasonable person, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, ordinarily would expect to be offsetting with respect to positions in more than one mixed straddle account shall be allocated among such accounts under a reasonable and consistent method that clearly reflects income. This paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by the following example. It is assumed that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) during the taxable year, and that gain or loss from the positions is treated as gain or loss from a capital asset.</p><p class="depth0">Example: B holds stock in XYZ Corporation, UVW Corporation, and RST Corporation, and options on a broad based stock index future. A reasonable person, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, would expect the stock in XYZ Corporation, UVW Corporation, and RST Corporation to be offsetting positions with respect to the options on the broad based stock index future. A reasonable person, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, would not expect that stock in XYZ Corporation, UVW Corporation, or RST Corporation would be offsetting positions with respect to each other. If B makes the mixed straddle account election under this section for all such positions, B must designate three separate classes of activities: one consisting of stock in XYZ Corporation; one consisting of stock in UVW Corporation; and one consisting of stock in RST Corporation, and maintain three separate mixed straddle accounts. Options on the broad based stock index future must be designated as part of all three classes of activities and gains and losses from such options must be allocated among such accounts under a reasonable and consistent method that clearly reflects income, because such options are a type of position expected to be offsetting with respect to the positions in all three mixed straddle accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Impermissible designations--(i) Types of positions that are not offsetting included in designated class of activities.

in this paragraph (f)(1), the election will be permitted only if the Commissioner concludes that the taxpayer had reasonable cause for failing to make a timely election. For example, if a calendar year taxpayer holds few positions in one class of activities prior to April 15 of a taxable year, and the taxpayer greatly increases trading activity with respect to positions in the class of activities after April 15, then the Commissioner may conclude that the taxpayer had reasonable cause for failing to make a timely election and allow the taxpayer to make a mixed straddle account election for the taxable year. See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules relating to the manner for making these elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner for making the election--(i) In general. A taxpayer must make the election on Form 6781 in the manner prescribed by such Form, and by attaching the Form to the taxpayer's income tax return for the immediately preceding taxable year (or request for an automatic extension). In addition, the taxpayer must attach a statement to Form 6781 designating with specificity the class of activities for which a mixed straddle account is established. The designation must describe the class of activities in sufficient detail so that the Commissioner may determine, on the basis of the designation, whether specific positions are includible in the mixed straddle account. In the case of a taxpayer who elects to establish more than one mixed straddle account, the Commissioner must be able to determine, on the basis of the designations, that specific positions are placed in the appropriate account. The election applies to all positions in the designated class of activities held by the taxpayer during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

Amended elections and elections made with respect to a new class of activities that the taxpayer has begun trading or investing in during a taxable year, shall be made on Form 6781 within the times prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. A statement must be attached to the Form containing the information required in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, with respect to the new or expanded designated class of activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule. The Commissioner may disregard a mixed straddle account election if the Commissioner determines, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, that the principal purpose for making the mixed straddle account election with respect to a class of activities was to avoid the rules of Sec. 1.1092(b)-1T (a). For example, if a taxpayer holds stock that is not part of a straddle and that would generate a loss if sold or otherwise disposed of, and the taxpayer both acquires offsetting option positions with respect to the stock and makes a mixed straddle account election with respect to the stock and stock options near the end of a taxable year, the Commissioner may disregard the mixed straddle account election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for taxable years ending after 1983 and before September 1, 1986. An election under this section to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts for any taxable year that includes July 17, 1984, and any taxable year that ends before September 1, 1986 (or, in the case of a corporation, October 1, 1986), must be made by the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> December 31, 1985, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The due date (without regard to automatic and discretionary extensions) of the return for the taxpayer's taxable year that begins in 1984 if the due date of the taxpayer's return for such year (without regard to automatic and discretionary extensions) is after December 31, 1985.
The election shall be made by attaching Form 6781 together with a statement to the taxpayer's income tax return, amended return, or other appropriate form that is filed on or before the deadline determined in the preceding sentence. The attached statement must designate with specificity, in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the class of activities for which a mixed straddle account is established. For example, if a fiscal year taxpayer's return (for its taxable year ending September 30, 1985) is due (without regard to extensions) on January 15, 1986, and the taxpayer intends to obtain an automatic extension to file the return, the election under this section for any or all of the fiscal years ending in 1984, 1985 or 1986 must be made on or before January 15, 1986,

with the request for an automatic extension. Similarly, a calendar year taxpayer (whether or not such taxpayer has obtained an automatic extension of time to file) who has filed its 1984 income tax return before October 15, 1985, without making a mixed straddle account election for either 1984 or 1985, or both, may make the mixed straddle account election under this section for either or for both of such years with an amended return filed on or before December 31, 1985. The mixed straddle account elected on this amended return will be effective for all positions in the designated class of activities even if the taxpayer had elected straddle-by-straddle identification as provided under Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T for purposes of the previously filed 1984 income tax return. For taxable years beginning in 1984 and 1985, the election under this paragraph (f)(3) is effective for the entire taxable year. For taxable years beginning in 1983, an election shall be effective for that part of the year beginning after December 31, 1983, for which the election under Sec. 1.1256(h)-1T or 1.1256(h)-2T is made. See Sec. 1.6081-1T regarding an extension of time to file certain individual income tax returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Period for which election is effective. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1984, an election under this section, including an amendment to the election pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, shall be effective only for the taxable year for which the election is made. This election may be revoked during the taxable year for the remainder of the taxable year only with the consent of the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke the election shall be filed with the service center with which the election was filed and shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Show that the volume or nature of the taxpayer's activities has changed substantially since the election was made, and that the taxpayer's activities no longer warrant the use of such mixed straddle account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any other relevant information.
If a taxpayer's election for a taxable year is revoked, the taxpayer may not make a new election for the same class of activities under paragraph (f)(1) of this section during the same taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section apply to positions held on or after January 1, 1984.

Sec. 1.1092(b)-6  Mixed straddles; accrued gain and loss associatedwith a position that becomes part of a section 1092(b)(2) identifiedmixed straddle that is established after August 18, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of unrealized gain or loss that arose before a position becomes part of an identified mixed straddle. Except as otherwise provided, if one or more positions of a straddle that is an identified mixed straddle described in section 1092(b)(2)(A)(i)(I) (identified mixed straddle) were held by the taxpayer on the day prior to the day the identified mixed straddle is established, any unrealized gain or loss on the day prior to the day the identified mixed straddle is established with respect to such position or positions is taken into account at the time, and has the character, provided by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that would apply to the gain or loss if the identified mixed straddle were not established. Thus, if a non-section 1256 capital asset was held for the long-term capital gain holding period before the identified mixed straddle was established, any unrealized gain or loss on that asset on the day prior to the day the identified mixed straddle was established will be long-term capital gain or loss when that asset is sold or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction. Unrealized gain or loss on a section 1256 contract that accrued prior to the day the contract became part of an identified mixed straddle will be recognized no later than the last business day of the taxpayer's taxable year. For each position, unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the fair market value of the position at the close of the day before the day the identified mixed straddle is established and the taxpayer's basis in that position. See Sec. 1.1092(b)-2T and paragraph (b) of this section for the treatment of holding periods with respect to such positions. Changes in value of the position or positions that occur on or after the identified mixed straddle is established are accounted for under the provisions of Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T (other than Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(6)). The definitions in Sec. 1.1092(b)-5T apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Holding period after a position becomes part of an identified mixed straddle. Section 1.1092(b)-2T(a)(1) applies to any position that becomes part of an identified mixed straddle, and the long-term or short-term character of any gain or loss on that position that arises on or after the day the position has become a position in an identified mixed straddle will be determined by beginning the taxpayer's holding period on the day after the identified mixed straddle ceases to exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of the loss deferral rules of section 1092(a). When applying section 1092(a) and Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b) (other than Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(6)) to any loss that arises while a position is part of an identified mixed straddle, the amount of unrecognized gain includes both unrecognized gains described in paragraph (a) of this section that accrued prior to the day the identified

mixed straddle is established and unrecognized gains that arise on or after the day the identified mixed straddle identification was made for the position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The rules of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the positions described are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year, and no successor positions are acquired or entered into. It is also assumed that gain or loss recognized on any position in the straddle would be capital gain or loss. The following examples assume that the identified mixed straddle is established after the applicability date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 13, Year 1, A enters into a section 1256 contract. As of the close of the day on January 15, Year 1, there is $500 of unrealized loss on the section 1256 contract. On January 16, Year 1, A enters into an offsetting non-section 1256 position and makes a valid election to treat the straddle as an identified mixed straddle. A continues to hold both positions of the identified mixed straddle on January 1, Year 2, and there are no further changes to the value of either position in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. On the last business day of Year 1, A recognizes the $500 loss on the section 1256 contract that accrued prior to establishing the identified mixed straddle because the section 1256 contract is treated as sold on December 31, Year 1 (the last business day of the taxable year) under section 1256(a). The loss recognized in Year 1 will be treated as 60% long-term capital loss and 40% short-term capital loss. All gains and losses that arise on or after the identified mixed straddle is established are accounted for under the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.1092(b)-2T (and paragraph (b) of this section), 1.1092(b)-3T(b) (other than Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(6)), and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On December 3, Year 1, A purchases a non-section 1256 position for $100. As of the close of the day on January 22, Year 2, the non-section 1256 position has a fair market value of $500. On January 23, Year 2, A enters into an offsetting section 1256 contract and makes a valid election to treat the straddle as an identified mixed straddle. On February 10, Year 2, A closes out the section 1256 contract at a $500 loss and disposes of the non-section 1256 position for $975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis of pre-straddle gain. A has $400 of unrealized short-term capital gain attributable to the non-section 1256 position prior to the day the identified mixed straddle was established. This $400 gain is recognized on February 10, Year 2, when the non-section 1256 position is disposed of. Under paragraph (a) of this section, the gain is short-term capital gain because that would have been the character of the gain if the non-section 1256 position had been disposed of on the day prior to establishing the identified mixed straddle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis of straddle gain and loss. On February 10, Year 2, the gain of $475 ($975 proceeds minus $500 fair market value on the day prior to entering into the identified mixed straddle) on the non-section 1256 position attributable to the identified mixed straddle period is offset by the $500 loss on the section 1256 contract. The net loss of $25 from the identified mixed straddle is recognized and treated as 60% long-term capital loss and 40% short-term capital loss because it is attributable to the section 1256 contract. See Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 3, Year 1, A purchases 100 shares of Index Fund for $1,000 ($10 per share). The Index Fund shares are actively traded personal property and are not section 1256 contracts. As of the close of the day on June 24, Year 2, the fair market value of 100 shares of Index Fund is $1,200. On June 25, Year 2, A enters into a short regulated futures contract (Futures Contract) referenced to the same index referenced by Index Fund. Futures Contract is a section 1256 contract and A makes a valid election to treat the shares of Index Fund and Futures Contract as an identified mixed straddle. On December 31, Year 2, the fair market value of A's shares of Index Fund is $1,520 and Futures Contract has lost $300. On January 10, Year 3, A closes out Futures Contract at a loss of $400 when the fair market value of 100 shares of Index Fund is $1,590. On November 20, Year 3, A disposes of all 100 shares of Index Fund for $1,600.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Year 2 analysis. On June 24, Year 2, A has held the Index Fund shares for longer than the long-term holding period, and the $200 of unrecognized gain on the Index Fund shares as of June 24, Year 2, will be characterized as long-term gain under paragraph (a) of this section when the gain is recognized. On December 31, Year 2, Futures Contract is marked to market under section 1256(a)(1). Under paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4), the loss on Futures Contract of $300 is netted with the $320 unrecognized gain on the Index Fund shares that arose while the identified mixed straddle was in place. Because this unrecognized gain is greater than the deemed realized section 1256 loss, the loss on Futures Contract is treated as a short-term capital loss. The loss, however, will be disallowed in Year 2 under paragraph (c) of this section and the loss deferral rules of section 1092(a) because

the unrecognized gain in the Index Fund shares that arose while the identified mixed straddle was in place exceeds the deemed realized loss. Even if this gain were only $250 on December 31, Year 2, the deemed realized loss on Futures Contract would be disallowed because there is $200 of unrecognized gain in the Index Fund shares from the time A held the shares prior to establishing the identified mixed straddle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Year 3 analysis. When A closes out the Futures Contract on January 10, Year 3, the entire amount of the section 1256 $300 loss that was disallowed on December 31, Year 2, continues to be deferred under paragraph (c) of this section. On November 20, Year 3, A recognizes $200 long-term capital gain from the pre-identified mixed straddle period, and $400 short-term capital gain, $390 of which arose during the identified mixed straddle period and $10 of which arose after the identified mixed straddle was closed. See Sec. 1.1092(b)-2T(a)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section. In Year 3, A recognizes the $300 short-term capital loss from Futures Contract disallowed in Year 2 and the $100 loss accrued on Futures Contract in Year 3 because A no longer holds any positions that were part of an identified mixed straddle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On March 1, Year 1, A purchases a 10-year U.S. Treasury Note (Note) at original issue for $100, which is the stated redemption price at maturity of Note. As of the close of the day on March 1, Year 3, Note has a fair market value of $105. On March 2, Year 3, A enters into a regulated futures contract (Futures Contract) that provides A with a short position in U.S. Treasury Notes and A makes a valid election to treat Note and Futures Contract as an identified mixed straddle. A closes her position in Futures Contract on April 15, Year 3, at a $2 loss. On April 15, Year 3, Note has a fair market value of $108. On December 31, Year 3, Note has a fair market value of $106. A holds Note until it matures on February 28, Year 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Year 3 analysis. A has $5 of unrealized gain attributable to Note prior to the day the identified mixed straddle was established. Because A acquired a long-term holding period in Note by March 1, Year 3, the $5 of gain will be characterized as long-term capital gain under paragraph (a) of this section when it is recognized. Under Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4), when A closes out Futures Contract on April 15, Year 3, the loss of $2 on Futures Contract is netted with the gain of $3 on Note that arose while the identified mixed straddle was in place. Because this gain on Note exceeds the realized loss on Futures Contract, the loss on Futures Contract is disallowed in Year 3 under paragraph (c) of this section. Further, under paragraph (c) of this section and section 1092(a)(1), on December 31, Year 3, the disallowed loss of $2 on Futures Contract cannot be recognized because it is less than the total unrecognized gain of $6 on Note on December 31, Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Year 10 analysis. When Note matures in Year 10, the $5 of unrecognized long-term capital gain that arose prior to the identified mixed straddle is recognized. Because A receives $100 upon the maturity of Note, A also recognizes a $5 long-term capital loss on Note, for a net gain of $0 (zero). In addition, the termination of all positions in the identified mixed straddle releases the $2 loss disallowed in Year 3 on Futures Contract. The loss on Futures Contract is treated as short-term capital loss in Year 10 under Sec. 1.1092(b)-3T(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. The rules of this section apply to all section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddles established after August 18, 2014.

Sec. 1.1092(c)-1  Qualified covered calls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 1092(c) defines a straddle as offsetting positions with respect to personal property. Under section 1092(d)(3)(B)(i)(I), stock is personal property if the stock is part of a straddle that involves an option on that stock or substantially identical stock or securities. Under section 1092(c)(4), however, writing a qualified covered call option and owning the optioned stock is not treated as a straddle under section 1092 if certain conditions, described in section 1092(c)(4)(B), are satisfied. Section 1092(c)(4)(H) authorizes the Secretary to modify these conditions to carry out the purposes of section 1092(c)(4) in light of changes in the marketplace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Term limitation--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an option is not a qualified covered call unless it is granted not more than 12 months before the day on which the option expires or satisfies term limitation and qualified benchmark requirements established by the Commissioner in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

The 12-month limitation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is extended to 33 months provided the lowest qualified benchmark is determined using the adjusted applicable

stock price, as defined in Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The 12-month limitation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is extended to 33 months provided the lowest qualified benchmark is determined using the adjusted applicable

The following examples illustrate the rules set out in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer owns stock in Corporation X. Taxpayer writes an equity option with standardized terms on Corporation X stock through a national securities exchange with a term of 21 months. The applicable stock price for Corporation X stock is $100. The bench marks for a 21-month equity option with standardized terms with an applicable stock price of $100 will be based upon the adjusted applicable stock price. Using the table at Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(e), the applicable stock price of $100 is multiplied by the adjustment factor 1.12, resulting in an adjusted applicable stock price of $112. Using the bench marks for an equity option with standardized terms with an adjusted applicable stock price of $112, the highest available strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price is $110, and the second highest strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price is $105. Therefore, a 21-month equity call option with standardized terms on Corporation X stock will not be deep in the money if the strike price is not less than $105.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer owns stock in Corporation Y. Taxpayer writes an equity option with standardized terms on Corporation Y stock through a national securities exchange with a term of 21 months. The applicable stock price for Corporation Y stock is $13.25. The bench marks for a 21-month equity option with standardized terms with an applicable stock price of $13.25 will be based upon the adjusted applicable stock price. Using the table at Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(e), the applicable stock price of $13.25 is multiplied by the adjustment factor 1.12, resulting in an adjusted applicable stock price of $14.84. Using the bench marks for an equity option with standardized terms with an adjusted applicable stock price of $14.84, the highest available strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price is $12.50. However, under section 1092(c)(4)(D), the lowest qualified bench mark can be no lower than 85% of the applicable stock price, which for Corporation Y stock is $12.61 (85% of the adjusted applicable stock price of $14.84). Thus, because the highest available strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price for an equity option with standardized terms is lower than the lowest qualified bench mark under section 1092(c)(4)(D), the lowest strike price at which a qualified covered call option can be written is the next higher strike price, or $15.00. Therefore, a 21-month equity call option with standardized terms on Corporation Y stock will not be deep in the money if the strike price is not less than $15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.1092(c)-2  Equity options with flexible terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 1092(c)(4) provides an exception to the general rule that a straddle exists if a taxpayer holds stock and writes a call option on that stock. Under section 1092(c)(4), the ownership of stock and the issuance of a call option meeting certain requirements result in a qualified covered call, which is exempted from the general straddle rules of section 1092. This section addresses the consequences of the availability of equity options with flexible terms under the qualified covered call rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No effect on lowest qualified bench mark for standardized options. The availability of strike prices for equity options with flexible terms does not affect the determination of the lowest qualified bench mark, as defined in section 1092(c)(4)(D), for an equity option with standardized terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified covered call option status--(1) Requirements.

An equity option with flexible terms is a qualified covered call option only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The option meets the requirements of section 1092(c)(4)(B) and Sec. 1.1092(c)-1 (taking into account paragraph (c)(2) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The only payments permitted with respect to the option are a single fixed premium paid not later than 5 business days after the day on which the option is granted, and a single fixed strike price, as defined in Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(d), that is payable entirely at (or within 5 business days of) exercise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An equity option with standardized terms is outstanding for the underlying equity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The underlying security is stock in a single corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lowest qualified bench mark--(i) In general. For purposes of determining whether an equity option with flexible terms is deep in the money within the meaning of section 1092(c)(4)(C), the lowest qualified bench mark under section 1092(c)(4)(D) is the same for an equity option with flexible terms as the

lowest qualified bench mark for an equity option with standardized terms on the same stock having the same applicable stock price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of determining whether an equity option with flexible terms is deep in the money within the meaning of section 1092(c)(4)(C), the lowest qualified bench mark under section 1092(c)(4)(D) is the same for an equity option with flexible terms as the

lowest qualified bench mark for an equity option with standardized terms on the same stock having the same applicable stock price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules set out in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer owns stock in Corporation X. Taxpayer writes an equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation X stock through a national securities exchange for a term of not more than 12 months. The applicable stock price for Corporation X stock is $73.75. Using the bench marks for an equity option with standardized terms with an applicable stock price of $73.75, the highest available strike price less than the applicable stock price is $70, and the second highest strike price less than the applicable stock price is $65. Therefore, an equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation X stock with a term of 90 days or less will not be deep in the money if the strike price is not less than $70. If the term is greater than 90 days, an equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation X will not be deep in the money if the strike price is not less than $65.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer owns stock in Corporation Y. Taxpayer writes a 9-month equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation Y stock through a national securities exchange. The applicable stock price for Corporation Y stock is $14.75. Using the bench marks for an equity option with standardized terms with an applicable stock price of $14.75, the highest available strike price less than the applicable stock price is $12.50. However, under section 1092(c)(4)(D), the lowest qualified bench mark can be no lower than 85% of the applicable stock price, which for Corporation Y stock is $12.54. Thus, because the highest available strike price less than the applicable stock price for an equity option with standardized terms is lower than the lowest qualified bench mark under section 1092(c)(4)(D), the lowest strike price at which a qualified covered call option can be written is the next higher strike price, or $15.00. This $15.00 strike price requirement for a qualified covered call option applies to equity options with flexible terms, equity options with standardized terms, and qualifying over-the-counter options.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Taxpayer owns stock in Corporation Z. On May 8, 2003, Taxpayer writes a 21-month equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation Z stock through a national securities exchange. The applicable stock price for Corporation Z stock is $100. The bench marks for a 21-month equity option with standardized terms with an applicable stock price of $100 will be based upon the adjusted applicable stock price. Using the table at Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(e), the applicable stock price of $100 is multiplied by the adjustment factor 1.12, resulting in an adjusted applicable stock price of $112. The highest available strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price is $110, and the second highest strike price less than the adjusted applicable stock price is $105. Therefore, a 21-month equity call option with flexible terms on Corporation Z stock will not be deep in the money if the strike price is not less than $105.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to equity options with flexible terms entered into on or after January 25, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Sec. 1.1092(c)-3  Qualifying over-the-counter options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 1092(c)(4)(B)(i), an equity option is not a qualified covered call option unless it is traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other market that the Secretary determines has rules adequate to carry out the purposes of section 1092(c)(4). In accordance with section 1092(c)(4)(H), this requirement is modified as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualified covered call option status. A qualifying over-the-counter option, as defined in Sec. 1.1092(c)-4(c), is a qualified covered call option if it meets the requirements of Sec.
