                            <p class="depth0">The definitions of Sec. 86.090-2 remain effective. The definitions  listed in this section apply beginning with the 1991 model year.</p><p class="depth0">Urban bus means a heavy heavy-duty diesel-powered passenger-carrying  vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers and intended  primarily for intra-city operation, i.e., within the confines of a city  or greater metropolitan area. Urban bus operation is characterized by  short rides and frequent stops. To facilitate this type of operation,  more than one set of quick-operating entrance and exit doors would  normally be installed. Since fares are usually paid in cash or tokens  rather than purchased in advance in the form of tickets, urban buses  would normally have equipment installed for collection of fares. Urban  buses are also typically characterized by the absence of equipment and  facilities for long distance travel, e.g., rest rooms, large luggage  compartments, and facilities for stowing carry-on luggage. The useful  life for urban buses is the same as the useful life for other heavy  heavy-duty diesel engines.  [55 FR 30619, July 26, 1990]</p>
