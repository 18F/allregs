                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the EWCP, SBA guarantees short-term working capital loans made  by participating lenders to exporters (section 7(a)(14) of the Act).  Loan maturities may be for up to three years with annual renewals.  Proceeds can be used only to finance export transactions. Loans can be  for single or multiple export transactions. An export transaction is the  production and payment associated with a sale of goods or services to a  foreign buyer. The maximum loan amount for any one EWCP loan is  $5,000,000. EWCP loans shall receive a guaranty of 90 percent, not to  exceed $4,500,000.  [61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 63546, Oct. 12, 2011]</p>
