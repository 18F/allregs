                                Sec. 27.923  Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each part tested as prescribed in this section must be in a serviceable condition at the end of the tests. No intervening disassembly which might affect test results may be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each rotor drive system and control mechanism must be tested for not less than 100 hours. The test must be conducted on the rotorcraft, and the torque must be absorbed by the rotors to be installed, except that other ground or flight test facilities with other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be used if the conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the conditions that would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A 60-hour part of the test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section must be run at not less than maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed for use with maximum continuous torque. In this test, the main rotor controls must be set in the position that will give maximum longitudinal cyclic pitch change to simulate forward flight. The auxiliary rotor controls must be in the position for normal operation under the conditions of the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A 30-hour or, for rotorcraft for which the use of either 30-minute OEI power or continuous OEI power is requested, a 25-hour part of the test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section must be run at not less than 75 percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 75 percent of maximum continuous torque. The main and auxiliary rotor controls must be in the position for normal operation under the conditions of the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A 10-hour part of the test prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section must be run at not less than takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque. The main and auxiliary rotor controls must be in the normal position for vertical ascent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of 2\1/2\ minute OEI power is requested, 12 runs during the 10-hour test must be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each run must consist of at least one period of 2\1/2\ minutes with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on all engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each run must consist of at least one period for each engine in sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the remaining engines are run at 2\1/2\ minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 2\1/2\ minute OEI torque for 2\1/2\ minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For multiengine turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second and 2-minute OEI power is requested, 10 runs must be conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately following a takeoff run of at least 5 minutes, each power source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds, followed by application of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 2-minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes. At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated ``flight idle'' condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at takeoff power.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed prescribed by the test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This test may be conducted on a representative bench test facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removal during the test. The loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the affected rotor drive system components must be representative of rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show compliance with the remainder of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The parts of the test prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section must be conducted in intervals of not less than 30 minutes and may be accomplished either on the ground or in flight. The part of the test prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section must be conducted in intervals of not less than five minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> At intervals of not more than five hours during the tests prescribed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the engine must be stopped rapidly enough to allow the engine and rotor drive to be automatically disengaged from the rotors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Under the operating conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 500 complete cycles of lateral control, 500 complete cycles of longitudinal control of the main rotors, and 500 complete cycles of control of each auxiliary rotor must be accomplished. A ``complete cycle'' involves movement of the controls from the neutral position, through both extreme positions, and back to the neutral position, except that control movements need not produce loads or flapping motions exceeding the maximum loads or motions encountered in flight. The cycling may be accomplished during the testing prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> At least 200 start-up clutch engagements must be accomplished--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> So that the shaft on the driven side of the clutch is accelerated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Using a speed and method selected by the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of 30-minute OEI power is requested, five runs must be made at 30-minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-minute OEI torque, in which each engine, in sequence, is made inoperative and the remaining engine(s) is run for a 30-minute period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of continuous OEI power is requested, five runs must be made at continuous OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with continuous OEI torque, in which each engine, in sequence, is made inoperative and the remaining engine(s) is run for a 1-hour period.
