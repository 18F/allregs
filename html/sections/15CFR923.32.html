For states adjacent to the Atlantic  or Pacific Ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico, the seaward boundary is the  outer limit of state title and ownership under the Submerged Lands Act  (48 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.), the Act of March 2, 1917 (48 U.S.C. 749), the  Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in  Political Union with the United States of America, as approved by the  Act of March 24, 1976 (48 U.S.C. 1681 note) or section 1 of the Act of  November 10, 1963, (48 U.S.C. 1705, as applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement for defining the seaward boundary of a State's  coastal zone can be met by a simple restatement of the limits defined in  this section, unless there are water areas which require a more exact  delineation because of site specific policies associated with these  areas. Where States have site specific policies for particular water  areas, these shall be mapped, described or referenced so that their  location can be determined reasonably easily by any party affected by  the policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The seaward limits, as defined in this section, are for purposes  of this program only and represent the area within which the State's  management program may be authorized and financed. These limits are  irrespective of any other claims States may have by virtue of other  laws.</p>
