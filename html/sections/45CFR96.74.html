                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Annual report. In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1397e, each state must submit an annual report to the Secretary by the due dates specified in Sec. 96.17 of this part. The annual report must cover the most recently completed fiscal year and, except for the data in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section, may be submitted in the format of the state's choice. The annual report must address the requirements in section 2006(a) of the Act, include the specific data required by section 2006(c), and include other information as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The number of individuals who receive services paid for in whole or in part with federal funds under the Social Services Block Grant, showing separately the number of children and the number of adults who received such services (section 2006(c)(1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of Social Services Block Grant funds spent in providing each service, showing separately for each service the average amount spent per child recipient and per adult recipient (section 2006(c)(2));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The total amount of federal, state and local funds spent in providing each service, including Social Services Block Grant funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The method(s) by which each service is provided, showing separately the services provided by public agencies, private agencies, or both (section 2006(c)(4)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The criteria applied in determining eligibility for each service such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee scales, the effect of public assistance benefits, and any requirements for enrollment in school or training programs (section 2006(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reporting requirement. (1) Each state must use the uniform definitions of services in appendix A of this part, categories 1-28, in submitting the data required in paragraph (a) of this section. Where a state cannot use the uniform definitions, it should report the data under category 29, ``Other Services.'' The state's definitions of each of the services listed in category 29 must be included in the annual report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each state must use the reporting form issued by the Department to report the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In reporting recipient and expenditure data, each state must report actual numbers of recipients and actual expenditures when this information is available. For purposes of this report, each state should, if possible, count only a single recipient for each service. States should also consider a service provided to a recipient for the length of the reporting period (one year) or any fraction thereof as a single service. Data based on sampling and/or estimates will be accepted when actual figures are unavailable. Each state must indicate for each service whether the data are based on actual figures, sampling, or estimates and must describe the sampling and/or estimation process(es) it used to obtain these data in the annual report. Each state must also indicate, in reporting recipient data, whether the data reflects an unduplicated count of recipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each state must use category 30, ``Other Expenditures,'' to report non-service expenditures. Only total dollar amounts in this category are required, i.e., they need not be reported by recipient count or cost per adult/child. This will include carry over balances,

carry forward balances, funds transferred to or from the SSBG program, and administrative costs as defined by the state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each state must use its own definition of the terms ``child'' and ``adult'' in reporting the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each state's definition of ``child'' and ``adult'' must be reported as a part of the eligibility criteria for each service required in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The data on eligibility criteria may be submitted in whatever format the state chooses as a part of its annual report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transfer of computer data. In addition to making the annual report available to the public and to the Department, a state may submit the information specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section using electronic equipment. A full description of procedures for electronic transmission of data, and of the availability of computer diskettes, is included in appendix B to this part.
