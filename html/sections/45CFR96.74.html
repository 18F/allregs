                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act, include the specific data required by  section 2006(c), and include other information as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The total amount of federal, state and local funds spent in  providing each service, including Social Services Block Grant funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4))</em>; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The criteria applied in determining eligibility for each service  such as income eligibility guidelines, sliding fee scales, the effect of  public assistance benefits, and any requirements for enrollment in  school or training programs (section 2006(c)(3)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each state must use the uniform  definitions of services in appendix A of this part, categories 1-28, in  submitting the data required in paragraph (a) of this section. Where a  state cannot use the uniform definitions, it should report the data  under category 29, ``Other Services.'' The state's definitions of each  of the services listed in category 29 must be included in the annual  report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each state must use the reporting form issued by the Department  to report the data required in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In reporting recipient and expenditure data, each state must  report actual numbers of recipients and actual expenditures when this  information is available. For purposes of this report, each state  should, if possible, count only a single recipient for each service.  States should also consider a service provided to a recipient for the  length of the reporting period (one year) or any fraction thereof as a  single service. Data based on sampling and/or estimates will be accepted  when actual figures are unavailable. Each state must indicate for each  service whether the data are based on actual figures, sampling, or  estimates and must describe the sampling and/or estimation process(es)  it used to obtain these data in the annual report. Each state must also  indicate, in reporting recipient data, whether the data reflects an  unduplicated count of recipients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each state must use category 30, ``Other Expenditures,'' to  report non-service expenditures. Only total dollar amounts in this  category are required, i.e., they need not be reported by recipient  count or cost per adult/child. This will include carry over balances,   carry forward balances, funds transferred to or from the SSBG program,  and administrative costs as defined by the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each state's definition of ``child'' and ``adult'' must be  reported as a part of the eligibility criteria for each service required  in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The data on eligibility criteria  may be submitted in whatever format the state chooses as a part of its  annual report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfer of computer data. In addition to making the annual  report available to the public and to the Department, a state may submit  the information specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this  section using electronic equipment. A full description of procedures for  electronic transmission of data, and of the availability of computer  diskettes, is included in appendix B to this part.  [58 FR 60129, Nov. 15, 1993]</p>
