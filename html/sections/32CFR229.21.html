This system will reference a set of   procedures for use by officers, employees, or agents of Federal agencies  to assist them in recognizing violations, documenting relevant evidence,  and reporting assembled information to the appropriate authorities.  Methods employed to document and report such violations should be  compatible with existing agency reporting systems for documenting  violations of other appropriate Federal statutes and regulations.  Summary information to be included in the Secretary's comprehensive  report will be based upon the system developed by each Federal land  manager for documenting suspected violations.</p>
