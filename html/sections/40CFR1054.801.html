This addresses uncertified engines and equipment initially placed into service that someone seeks to import into the United States. Importation of this kind of engine (or equipment containing such an engine) is generally prohibited by 40 CFR part 1068. However, the importation of such an engine is not prohibited if the engine has a model year before 1997, since it is not subject to standards.</p><p class="depth0">New nonroad equipment means either of the following things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A nonroad piece of equipment for which the ultimate purchaser has never received the equitable or legal title. The product is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives this title or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A nonroad piece of equipment with an engine that becomes new while installed in the equipment. For example a complete piece of equipment that was imported without being covered by a certificate of conformity would be new nonroad equipment because the engine would be considered to be new at the time of importation.</p><p class="depth0">Noncompliant engine or noncompliant equipment means an engine or equipment that was originally covered by a certificate of conformity but is not in the certified configuration or otherwise does not comply with the conditions of the certificate.</p><p class="depth0">Nonconforming engine or nonconforming equipment means an engine or equipment not covered by a certificate of conformity that would otherwise be subject to emission standards.</p><p class="depth0">Nonhandheld means relating to an engine (or equipment) subject to the standards of this part that is not a handheld engine (or equipment).</p><p class="depth0">Nonintegrated equipment manufacturer means an equipment manufacturer that is not an integrated equipment manufacturer.

Tanks are generally considered identical if they are produced under a single part number to conform to a single design or blueprint. Tanks should be considered identical if they differ only with respect to production variability, post-production changes (such as different fittings or grommets), supplier, color, or other extraneous design variables.</p><p class="depth0">Small-volume engine manufacturer means one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For handheld engines, an engine manufacturer that had U.S.-directed production volume of handheld engines of no more than 25,000 handheld engines in any calendar year.

similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Spark-ignition engines usually use a throttle to regulate intake air flow to control power during normal operation.</p><p class="depth0">Steady-state means relating to emission tests in which engine speed and load are held at a finite set of essentially constant values. Steady-state tests are either discrete-mode tests or ramped-modal tests.</p><p class="depth0">Structurally integrated nylon fuel tank has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1060.801.</p><p class="depth0">Subchapter U means the portion of the Code of Federal Regulations including 40 CFR parts 1000 through 1299.</p><p class="depth0">Suspend has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. In general this means to temporarily discontinue the certificate or an exemption for an engine family.</p><p class="depth0">Test engine means an engine in a test sample.</p><p class="depth0">Test sample means the collection of engines selected from the population of an emission family for emission testing. This may include testing for certification, production-line testing, or in-use testing.</p><p class="depth0">Tethered gas cap means a gas cap that is loosely but permanently connected to the fuel tank.</p><p class="depth0">Thermal reactor means a hot surface in the engine exhaust system that has the effect of significantly lowering emissions of one or more regulated pollutants. Hot surfaces that have an inconsequential effect on emissions are not thermal reactors.</p><p class="depth0">Total hydrocarbon has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1065.1001. This generally means the combined mass of organic compounds measured by the specified procedure for measuring total hydrocarbon, expressed as an atomic hydrocarbon with a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of 1.85:1.</p><p class="depth0">Total hydrocarbon equivalent has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1065.1001. This generally means the sum of the carbon mass contributions of non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, alcohols and aldehydes, or other organic compounds that are measured separately as contained in a gas sample, expressed as exhaust hydrocarbon from petroleum-fueled engines. The atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the equivalent hydrocarbon is 1.85:1.</p><p class="depth0">Ultimate purchaser means, with respect to any new nonroad equipment or new nonroad engine, the first person who in good faith purchases such new nonroad equipment or new nonroad engine for purposes other than resale.</p><p class="depth0">United States has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30.</p><p class="depth0">Upcoming model year for an emission family means the model year after the one currently in production.</p><p class="depth0">U.S.-directed production volume means the number of engine or equipment units, subject to the requirements of this part, produced by a manufacturer for which the manufacturer has a reasonable assurance that sale was or will be made to ultimate purchasers in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Useful life means the period during which the engine and equipment are designed to properly function in terms of power output and intended function, without being remanufactured, specified as a number of hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. It is the period during which a nonroad engine is required to comply with all applicable emission standards. See, for example, Sec. Sec.  1054.107, 1054.110, and 1054.112. If an engine has no hour meter, the specified number of hours does not limit the period during which an in-use engine is required to comply with emission standards unless the degree of service accumulation can be verified separately.</p><p class="depth0">Variable-speed engine means an engine that is not a constant-speed engine.</p><p class="depth0">Vessel means marine vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Void has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. In general this means to invalidate a certificate or an exemption both retroactively and prospectively.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile liquid fuel means any fuel other than diesel or biodiesel that is a liquid at atmospheric pressure and has a Reid Vapor Pressure higher than 2.0 pounds per square inch.</p><p class="depth0">We (us, our) means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and any authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth0">Wide-open throttle means maximum throttle opening.</p><p class="depth0">Wintertime engine means an engine used exclusively to power equipment

that is used only in wintertime, such as snowthrowers and ice augers.
