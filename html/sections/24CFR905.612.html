                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Predevelopment costs. After a new development project has been included in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan that has

been approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, a PHA may use funding for predevelopment expenses. Predevelopment funds may be expended in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Predevelopment assistance may be used to pay for materials and services related to proposal development and project soft costs. It may also be used to pay for costs related to the demolition of units on a proposed site. Absent HUD approval, predevelopment assistance may not be used to pay for site work, installation of infrastructure, construction, or other hard costs related to a development.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For non-mixed-finance projects, predevelopment funding up to 5 percent of the total amount of the public housing funds committed to a project does not require HUD approval. HUD shall determine on a case-by-case basis that an amount greater than 5 percent may be drawn down by a PHA to pay for necessary and reasonable predevelopment costs, based upon a consideration of the nature and scope of activities proposed to be carried out by the PHA. Before a request for predevelopment assistance in excess of 5 percent may be approved, the PHA must provide to HUD information and documentation specified in Sec. Sec. 905.606 and 905.608 of this part, as HUD deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For mixed-finance projects, all funding for predevelopment costs must be reviewed and approved by HUD prior to expenditure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section to disburse funds for mixed-financed projects in an approved ratio to other public and private funding do not apply to disbursement of predevelopment funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard drawdown requirements. (1) General. If HUD determines that the proposed development is approvable, it may execute with the PHA the applicable ACC Amendment to provide funds for the purposes and in the amounts approved by HUD. Upon approval of the development proposal and all necessary documentation evidencing and implementing the development plan, the PHA may disburse amounts as are necessary and consistent with the approved development proposal without further HUD approval, unless HUD determines that such approval is necessary. Once HUD approves the site acquisition proposal, the PHA may request funds for acquisition activities. Each Capital Fund disbursement from HUD is deemed to be an attestation of compliance by the PHA with the requirements of this part, as prescribed in Sec. 905.106 of this part. If HUD determines that the PHA is in noncompliance with any provision of this part, the PHA may be subject to the sanctions in Sec. 905.800, subpart H, of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.

For mixed-finance projects, prior to PHA disbursement of public housing funds, except predevelopment funds identified in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD may require a PHA to submit to HUD, for review and approval, copies of final, fully executed, and, where appropriate, recorded documents, submitted as part of the development proposal process. Upon completion of the project, the ratio of public housing funds to non-public housing funds for the overall project must remain as reflected in the executed documents. The ratio does not apply during the construction period.</p>
