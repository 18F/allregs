                            <p class="depth0">This part describes the types of properties eligible for flood insurance coverage under the Program, the limits of such coverage, and the premium rates actually to be paid by insureds. The specific communities eligible for coverage are designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator from time to time as applications are approved under the emergency program and as ratemaking studies of communities are completed prior to the regular program. Lists of such communities are periodically published under part 64 of this subchapter.
