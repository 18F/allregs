request for payment signed by a general partner. The signature to the request should be in the form, for example, ``Smith and Jones, a partnership, by John Jones, a general partner''. A request for payment so signed and certified will ordinarily be accepted as sufficient evidence that the partnership is still in existence and that the person signing the request is authorized.</p>
