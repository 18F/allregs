                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right of appeal. You have the right to appeal a partial or full denial of your FOIA request. To do so, you must put your appeal in writing and send it to the review official identified in the denial letter. You must send your appeal within 30 days from the date you receive that letter or from the date you receive the records released as a partial grant of your request, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Letter of appeal. The appeal letter should state reasons why you believe that the FOIA exemption(s) we cited do not apply to the records that you requested, or give reasons why they should be released regardless of whether the exemption(s) apply. Because we have some discretionary authority in deciding whether to release or withhold records, you may strengthen your request by explaining your reasons for wanting the records. However, you are not required to give any explanation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review process. Before making a decision on an appeal of a denial, the designated review official will consult with the General Counsel to ensure that the rights and interests of all parties affected by the request are protected. Also, the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs is required in all appeal decisions, including those on fees. When the review official responds to an appeal, that constitutes the Department's final action on the request. If the review official grants your appeal, we will send the records to you promptly or let you inspect them, or else we will explain the reason for any delay and the approximate date you will receive copies or be allowed to inspect the records. If the decision is to deny your appeal, the official will state the reasons for the decision in writing and inform you of the FOIA provision for judicial review.</p>
