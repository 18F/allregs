                            <p class="depth0">If a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of  testifying, either while testifying, or before testifying if the judge  in the judge's discretion determines it is necessary in the interest of  justice, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at  the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to  introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of  the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not  related to the subject matter of the testimony the judge shall examine  the writing in camera, excise any portion not so related, and order  delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion  withheld over objections shall be preserved and made available in the  event of review. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to  order under this rule, the judge shall make any order justice requires.</p>
