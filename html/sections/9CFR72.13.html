                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Dipping requirements; facilities; handling. The dipping of cattle for interstate movement shall be done only with a permitted dip and at places where proper equipment is provided for dipping and for handling the cattle in a manner to prevent exposure to infection after the final dipping. Cattle which are to be dipped shall be given an opportunity to drink sufficient water to quench their thirst prior to dipping, be carefully handled, and not dipped while they are in a heated or exhausted condition. Dipped cattle shall not be loaded for shipment until dry. \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ Care is required when treating animals and in maintaining the required concentration of chemicals in dipping baths. Detailed information concerning the use of, criteria for, and names of proprietary brands of permitted dips--as well the use of compressed air, vat management techniques, and other information--is available from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, National Animal Health Programs, 4700 River Road Unit 43, Riverdale, MD 20737-1231.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permitted dips. The dips at present permitted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in official dipping for interstate movement are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approved proprietary brands of coumaphos (Co-Ral [supreg]), 25 percent wettable powder or flowable form labeled for use as a 0.25 percent dip and used at a concentration of 0.125 to 0.250. \4\</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of dips. Proprietary brands of dips are permitted to be used for purposes of this part only when approved by the Administrator, APHIS. Before a dip will be specifically approved as a permitted dip for the eradication of ticks, APHIS will require that the product be registered under the provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.); that its efficacy and stability have been demonstrated; that trials have been conducted to determine that its concentration can be maintained and that under actual field conditions the dipping of cattle with a solution of definite strength will effectually eradicate ticks without injury to the animals dipped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tissue residues; restriction on slaughter. Tissue residues are created following use of certain dips. Animals treated with such dips should not be slaughtered for food purposes until the expiration of such period as may be required under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The length of this period shall be specified on each certificate issued by the inspector who supervises the dipping.
