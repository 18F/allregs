                                Sec. 416.201  General definitions and terms used in this subpart.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any 9-month period means any period of 9 full calendar months ending  with any full calendar month throughout which (as defined in  Sec. 416.211) an individual is residing in a public emergency shelter  for the homeless (as defined in this section) and including the  immediately preceding 8 consecutive full calendar months. January 1988  is the earliest possible month in any 9-month period.</p><p class="depth0">Educational or vocational training means a recognized program for  the acquisition of knowledge or skills to prepare an individual for  gainful employment. For purposes of these regulations, educational or  vocational training does not include programs limited to the acquisition  of basic life skills including but not limited to eating and dressing.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency shelter means a shelter for individuals whose homelessness  poses a threat to their lives or health.</p><p class="depth0">Homeless individual is one who is not in the custody of any public  institution and has no currently usable place to live. By custody we  mean the care and control of an individual in a mandatory residency  where the individual's freedom to come and go as he or she chooses is  restricted. An individual in a public institution awaiting discharge and  placement in the community is in the custody of that institution until  discharged and is not homeless for purposes of this provision.</p><p class="depth0">Institution means an establishment that makes available some  treatment or services in addition to food and shelter to four or more  persons who are not related to the proprietor.</p><p class="depth0">Medical treatment facility means an institution or that part of an  institution that is licensed or otherwise approved by a Federal, State,  or local government to provide inpatient medical care and services.</p><p class="depth0">Public emergency shelter for the homeless means a public institution  or that part of a public institution used as an emergency shelter by the  Federal government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State,  primarily for making available on a temporary basis a place to sleep,  food, and some services or treatment to homeless individuals. A medical  treatment facility (as defined in Sec. 416.201) or any holding facility,  detoxification center, foster care facility, or the like that has  custody of the individual is not a public emergency shelter for the  homeless. Similarly, transitional living arrangements such as a halfway  house that are part of an insitution's plan to facilitate the  individual's adjustment to community living are not public emergency  shelters for the homeless.</p><p class="depth0">Public institution means an institution that is operated by or  controlled by the Federal government, a State, or   a political subdivision of a State such as a city or county. The term  public institution does not include a publicly operated community  residence which serves 16 or fewer residents.</p><p class="depth0">Resident of a public institution means a person who can receive  substantially all of his or her food and shelter while living in a  public institution. The person need not be receiving treatment and  services available in the institution and is a resident regardless of  whether the resident or anyone else pays for all food, shelter, and  other services in the institution. A person is not a resident of a  public institution if he or she is living in a public educational  institution for the primary purpose of receiving educational or  vocational training as defined in this section. A resident of a public  institution means the same thing as an inmate of a public institution as  used in section 1611(e)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. (See  Sec. 416.211(b), (c), and (d) of this subpart for exceptions to the  general limitation on the eligibility for Supplemental Security Income  benefits of individuals who are residents of a public institution.)</p><p class="depth0">SSI means supplemental security income.</p><p class="depth0">State assistance means payments made by a State to an aged, blind,  or disabled person under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or  XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act which was in effect before the SSI  Program.</p><p class="depth0">We or Us means the Social Security Administration.</p><p class="depth0">You or Your means the person who applies for or receives SSI  benefits or the person for whom an application is filed.
