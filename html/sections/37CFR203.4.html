                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of the Freedom of  Information Act, the Copyright Office makes available for public  inspection and copying records of copyright registrations and of final  refusals to register claims to copyright; statements of policy and  interpretations which have been adopted but are not published in the  Federal Register; and administrative staff manuals and instructions to  the staff that affect a member of the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Copyright Office also maintains and makes available for  public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying  information as to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4,  1967, that are within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). The Copyright  Office has determined that publication of these indexes is unnecessary  and impractical. Copies of the indexes will be provided to any member of  the public upon request at the cost of reproduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The material and indexes referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b)  of this section are available for public inspection and copying at the  Public Information Office of the Copyright Office, Room LM-401, The  James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress, 1st and  Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m.  and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist is responsible  for responding to all initial requests submitted under the Freedom of  Information Act. Individuals desiring to obtain access to Copyright  Office information under the Act should make a written request to that  effect either by mail to the Supervisory Copyright Information  Specialist, Information and Publications Section, Information and  Reference Division, Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington,  DC 20559-6000, or in person between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on  any working day except legal holidays at Room LM-401, The James Madison  Memorial Building, 1st and Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC. If a  request is made by mail, both the request and the envelope containing it  should be plainly marked Freedom of Information Act Request. Failure to  so mark a mailed request may delay the Office response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records must be reasonably described. A request reasonably  describes records if it enables the Office to identify the records  requested by any process that is not unreasonably burdensome or  disruptive of Office operations. The Supervisory Copyright Information  Specialist will, upon request, aid members of the public to formulate  their requests in such a manner as to enable the Office to respond  effectively and reduce search costs for the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Office will respond to all properly marked mailed requests  and all personally delivered written requests for records within twenty  (20) working days of receipt by the Supervisory Copyright Information  Specialist. Inquiries should be mailed to: Copyright Office, GC/I&R;,  P.O. Box 70400, Washington, DC 20024. If hand delivered, materials  should go to: Copyright Public Information Office, LM 401, James Madison  Memorial Building, Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, SE,  Washington, DC. Office hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday  through Friday, excluding holidays. If it is determined that an  extension of time greater than ten (10) working   days is necessary to respond to a request due to unusual circumstances,  as defined in paragraph (i) of this section, the Supervisory Copyright  Information Specialist shall so notify the requester and give the  requester the opportunity to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed  within twenty (20) working days, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arrange with the Office an alternative time frame for processing  the request or a modified request. If a request is denied, the written  notification will include the basis for the denial, names of all  individuals who participated in the determination, and procedures  available to appeal the determination. If a requester wishes to appeal a  denial of some or all of his or her request for information, he or she  must make an appeal in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of  the Office's denial. The request should be directed to the General  Counsel of the United States Copyright Office at: Copyright GC/I&R;, P.O.  Box 70400, Washington, DC 20024. The appeal should be clearly labeled  `Freedom of Information Act Appeal'.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The appeal shall include a statement explaining the basis for  the appeal. Determinations of appeals will be set forth in writing and  signed by the General Counsel or his or her delegate within 20 working  days. If, on appeal, the denial is in whole or in part upheld, the  written determination will include the basis for the appeal denial and  will also contain a notification of the provisions for judicial review  and the names of the persons who participated in the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In unusual circumstances, the General Counsel may extend the  time limits prescribed in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for not  more than 10 working days. The extension period may be split between the  initial request and the appeal but the total period of extension shall  not exceed 10 working days. Extensions will be by written notice to the  person making the request. The Copyright Office will advise the  requester of the reasons for the extension and the date the  determination is expected. As used in this paragraph ``unusual  circumstances'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  establishments that are physically separate from the office processing  the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount  of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practical speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in  the determination of the request or among two or more components of the  Copyright Office which have a substantial subject matter interest  therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist will consider  requests for expedited processing of requests in cases where the  requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing. The term  ``compelling need'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis  could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning  actual or alleged Federal Government activity. Requesters for expedited  processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the  basis for the claim that a ``compelling need'' exists for the requested  information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the  best of his or her knowledge and belief. The Office will determine  whether to grant a request for expedited processing and will notify the  requester of such determination within ten (10) days of receipt of the  request. If a request for expedited processing is approved, documents  responsive to the request will be processed as soon as is practicable.  Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed to the  Office of the General Counsel.
