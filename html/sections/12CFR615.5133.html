Your board must also ensure that management complies with these policies and that appropriate internal controls are in place to prevent loss. At least annually, the board, or a designated committee of the board, must review the sufficiency of these investment policies. Any changes to the policies must be adopted by the board and be documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investment policies--general requirements. Your board's written investment policies must address the purposes and objectives of investments; risk tolerance; delegations of authority; internal controls; due diligence; and reporting requirements. Moreover, your investment policies must fully address the extent of pre-purchase analysis that management must perform for various classes of investments. Furthermore, your investment policies must address the means for reporting, and approvals needed for, exceptions to established policies. Investment policies must be sufficiently detailed, consistent with, and appropriate for the amounts, types, and risk characteristics of your investments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Investment policies--risk tolerance. Your investment policies must establish risk limits for the various types, classes, and sectors of eligible investments and for the entire investment portfolio. These policies must include concentration limits to ensure prudent diversification of credit, market, and liquidity risks in the investment portfolio. Risk limits must be based on all relevant factors, including your institutional objectives, capital position, earnings, and quality and reliability of risk management systems and must take into consideration the interest rate risk management program required by Sec. 615.5180 or Sec. 615.5182, as applicable. Your policies must identify the types and quantity of investments that you will hold to achieve your objectives and control credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. Each association or service corporation that holds significant investments and each bank must establish risk limits in its investment policies for these four types of risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit risk. Investment policies must establish:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Credit quality standards, limits on counterparty risk, and risk diversification standards that limit concentrations. Limits must be set for single or related counterparty(ies), a geographical area, industries, and asset classes or obligations with similar characteristics.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Criteria for selecting brokers, dealers, and investment bankers (collectively, securities firms). You must buy and sell eligible investments with more than one securities firm. As part of your review of your investment policies required under paragraph (a) of this section, your board of directors, or a designated committee of the board, must review the criteria for selecting securities firms. Any changes to the criteria must be approved by the board.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collateral margin requirements on repurchase agreements. You must regularly mark the collateral to market and ensure appropriate controls are maintained over collateral held.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Market risk. Investment policies must set market risk limits for specific types of investments and for the investment portfolio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liquidity risk. Investment policies must describe the liquidity characteristics of eligible investments that you will hold to meet your liquidity needs and other institutional objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Operational risk. Investment policies must address operational risks, including delegations of authority and internal controls in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delegation of authority. All delegations of authority to specified personnel or committees must state the extent of management's authority and responsibilities for investments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Internal controls. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establish appropriate internal controls to detect and prevent loss, fraud, embezzlement, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized investments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish and maintain a separation of duties between personnel who supervise or execute investment transactions and personnel who supervise or engage in all other investment-related functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain records and management information systems that are appropriate for the level and complexity of your investment activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Implement an effective internal audit program to review, at least annually, your investment management function, controls, processes, and compliance with FCA regulations. The scope of the annual review must be appropriate for the size, risk and complexity of the investment portfolio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Due diligence--(1) Pre-purchase analysis. (i) Eligibility, purpose, and compliance with investment policies. Before you purchase an investment, you must conduct sufficient due diligence to determine whether it is eligible under Sec. 615.5140, is for an authorized purpose under Sec. 615.5132 or Sec. 615.5142, as applicable, and complies with your board's investment policies. You must document your assessment and the information used in your assessment.

Prior to purchase, you must verify the value of the investment (unless it is a new issue) with a source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty or other intermediary to the transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Risk assessment. Your assessment of each investment at the time of purchase must at a minimum include an evaluation of credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and the underlying collateral of the investment. This assessment must be commensurate with the complexity and risk in the investment. You must perform stress testing on any investment that is structured or that has uncertain cash flows, including all mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, before you purchase it. The stress test must be commensurate with the risk and complexity of the investment and must enable you to determine that the investment does not expose your capital, earnings, or liquidity to risks that are greater than those specified in your investment policies. The stress testing must comply with the requirements in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ongoing value determination. At least monthly, you must determine the fair market value of each investment in your portfolio and the fair market value of your whole investment portfolio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ongoing analysis of credit risk.

(i) You must stress test your entire investment portfolio, including stress tests of all investments individually and stress tests of the portfolio as a whole, at the end of each quarter. The stress tests must enable you to determine that your investment securities, both individually and on a portfolio-wide basis, do not expose your capital, earnings, or liquidity to risks that exceed the risk tolerance specified in your investment policies. If your portfolio risk exceeds your investment policy limits, you must develop a plan to comply with those limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must stress test your entire investment portfolio, including stress tests of all investments individually and stress tests of the portfolio as a whole, at the end of each quarter.

The stress tests must be comprehensive and appropriate for the risk profile of your institution. At a minimum, the stress tests must be able to measure the price sensitivity of investments over a range of possible interest rate/yield curve scenarios. The methodology that you use to analyze investment securities must be appropriate for the complexity, structure, and cash flows of the investments in your portfolio. You must rely to the maximum extent practicable on verifiable information

to support all your assumptions, including prepayment and interest rate volatility assumptions, when you apply your stress tests. You must document the basis for all assumptions that you use to evaluate the security and its underlying collateral. You must also document all subsequent changes in your assumptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Presale value verification. Before you sell an investment, you must verify its value with a source that is independent of the broker, dealer, counterparty, or other intermediary to the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reports to the board of directors.
