Except as authorized by TJAG, the General Counsel, the Chief of Litigation Division, or this regulation, no Army personnel will confer or correspond with DOJ concerning legal proceedings in which the Army has an interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. This prohibition does not preclude contact with DOJ required by the Memorandum of Understanding between DOJ and DOD relating to the investigation and prosecution of certain crimes. (See AR 27-10, para 2-7). In addition, an installation SJA or legal adviser is expected to maintain a working relationship with the U.S. Attorney in each district within his geographical area. An SJA or legal adviser should request the U.S. Attorney to advise him immediately when litigation involving DA or its personnel is served on the U.S. Attorney.
