Child-occupied facilities  may include, but are not limited to, day care centers, preschools and  kindergarten classrooms. Child-occupied facilities may be located in  target housing or in public or commercial buildings. With respect to  common areas in public or commercial buildings that contain child- occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only those  common areas that are routinely used by children under age 6, such as  restrooms and cafeterias. Common areas that children under age 6 only  pass through, such as hallways, stairways, and garages are not included.  In addition, with respect to exteriors of public or commercial buildings  that contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility  encompasses only the exterior sides of the building that are immediately  adjacent to the child-occupied facility or the common areas routinely  used by children under age 6.</p><p class="depth0">Cleaning verification card means a card developed and distributed,  or otherwise approved, by EPA for the purpose of determining, through  comparison of wet and dry disposable cleaning cloths with the card,  whether post-renovation cleaning has been properly completed.</p><p class="depth0">Component or building component means specific design or structural  elements or fixtures of a building or residential dwelling that are  distinguished from each other by form, function, and location. These  include, but are not limited to, interior components such as: Ceilings,  crown molding, walls, chair rails, doors, door trim, floors, fireplaces,  radiators and other heating units, shelves, shelf supports, stair  treads, stair risers, stair stringers, newel posts, railing caps,  balustrades, windows and trim (including sashes, window heads, jambs,  sills or stools and troughs), built in cabinets, columns, beams,  bathroom vanities, counter tops, and air conditioners; and exterior  components such as: Painted roofing, chimneys, flashing, gutters and  downspouts, ceilings, soffits, fascias, rake boards, cornerboards,  bulkheads, doors and door trim, fences, floors, joists, lattice work,  railings and railing caps, siding, handrails, stair risers and treads,  stair stringers, columns, balustrades, windowsills or stools and  troughs, casings, sashes and wells, and air conditioners.</p><p class="depth0">Dry disposable cleaning cloth means a commercially available dry,  electrostatically charged, white disposable cloth designed to be used  for cleaning hard surfaces such as uncarpeted floors or counter tops.</p><p class="depth0">Firm means a company, partnership, corporation, sole proprietorship  or individual doing business, association, or other business entity; a  Federal, State, Tribal, or local government agency; or a nonprofit  organization.</p><p class="depth0">HEPA vacuum means a vacuum cleaner which has been designed with a  high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter as the last filtration  stage. A HEPA filter is a filter that is capable of capturing  particulates of 0.3 microns with 99.97% efficiency. The vacuum cleaner  must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled  through the HEPA filter with none of the air leaking past it. HEPA  vacuums must be operated and maintained in accordance with the  manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth0">Interim controls means a set of measures designed to temporarily  reduce human exposure or likely exposure to lead-based paint hazards,  including specialized cleaning, repairs, maintenance, painting,  temporary containment, ongoing monitoring of lead-based paint hazards or  potential hazards, and the establishment and operation of management and  resident education programs.</p><p class="depth0">Minor repair and maintenance activities are activities, including  minor heating,   ventilation or air conditioning work, electrical work, and plumbing,  that disrupt 6 square feet or less of painted surface per room for  interior activities or 20 square feet or less of painted surface for  exterior activities where none of the work practices prohibited or  restricted by Sec. 745.85(a)(3) are used and where the work does not  involve window replacement or demolition of painted surface areas. When  removing painted components, or portions of painted components, the  entire surface area removed is the amount of painted surface disturbed.  Jobs, other than emergency renovations, performed in the same room  within the same 30 days must be considered the same job for the purpose  of determining whether the job is a minor repair and maintenance  activity.</p><p class="depth0">Painted surface means a component surface covered in whole or in  part with paint or other surface coatings.</p><p class="depth0">Pamphlet means the EPA pamphlet titled Renovate Right: Important  Lead Hazard Information for Families, Child Care Providers and Schools  developed under section 406(a) of TSCA for use in complying with section  406(b) of TSCA, or any State or Tribal pamphlet approved by EPA pursuant  to 40 CFR 745.326 that is developed for the same purpose.

The term renovation includes (but is not  limited to): The removal, modification or repair of painted surfaces or  painted components (e.g., modification of painted doors, surface  restoration, window repair, surface preparation activity (such as  sanding, scraping, or other such activities that may generate paint  dust)); the removal of building components (e.g., walls, ceilings,  plumbing, windows); weatherization projects (e.g., cutting holes in  painted surfaces to install blown-in insulation or to gain access to  attics, planing thresholds to install weather-stripping), and interim  controls that disturb painted surfaces. A renovation performed for the  purpose of converting a building, or part of a building, into target  housing or a child-occupied facility is a renovation under this subpart.  The term renovation does not include minor repair and maintenance  activities.</p><p class="depth0">Renovator means an individual who either performs or directs workers  who perform renovations. A certified renovator is a renovator who has  successfully completed a renovator course accredited by EPA or an EPA- authorized State or Tribal program.</p><p class="depth0">Training hour means at least 50 minutes of actual learning,  including, but not limited to, time devoted to lecture, learning  activities, small group activities, demonstrations, evaluations, and  hands-on experience.</p><p class="depth0">Wet disposable cleaning cloth means a commercially available, pre- moistened white disposable cloth designed to be used for cleaning hard  surfaces such as uncarpeted floors or counter tops.</p><p class="depth0">Vertical containment means a vertical barrier consisting of plastic  sheeting or other impermeable material over scaffolding or a rigid  frame, or an equivalent system of containing the work area. Vertical  containment is required for some exterior renovations but it may be used  on any renovation.</p><p class="depth0">Wet mopping system means a device with the following  characteristics: A long handle, a mop head designed to be used with  disposable absorbent cleaning pads, a reservoir for cleaning solution,  and a built-in mechanism for distributing or spraying the cleaning  solution onto a floor, or a method of equivalent efficacy.</p><p class="depth0">Work area means the area that the certified renovator establishes to  contain the dust and debris generated by a renovation.
