                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Although a forfeiture of good time will not bar a prisoner from  receiving a parole hearing, D.C. Code 24-404 permits the Commission to  parole only those prisoners who have substantially observed the rules of  the institution. Consequently, the Commission will consider a grant of  parole for a prisoner with forfeited good time only after a thorough  review of the circumstances underlying the disciplinary infraction(s).  The Commission must be satisfied that the prisoner has served a period  of imprisonment sufficient to   outweigh the seriousness of the prisoner's misconduct.
