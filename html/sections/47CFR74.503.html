In general, the lowest suitable frequency will be assigned which, on an engineering basis, will not cause harmful interference to other stations operating in accordance with existing frequency allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where it appears that interference may result from the operation of a new station or a change in the facilities of an existing station, the Commission may require a showing that harmful interference will not be caused to existing stations or that if interference will be caused the need for the proposed service outweighs the loss of service due to the interference.
