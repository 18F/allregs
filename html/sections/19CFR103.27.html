                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required prior approval for disclosure. In any foreign proceeding in which CBP is not a party, no CBP employee shall, in response to a demand, furnish CBP documents or testimony as to any material contained in CBP files, any information relating to or based upon material contained in CBP files, or any information or material acquired as part of the performance of that person's official duties (or because of that person's official status) without the prior approval of the Chief Counsel, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee notification to Counsel. Whenever a demand in a foreign proceeding is made upon a CBP employee concerning pre-clearance activities within the territory of the foreign country, that employee shall immediately notify the appropriate Associate Chief Counsel responsible for the pre-clearance location.
