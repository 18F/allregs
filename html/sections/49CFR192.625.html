Operators of master meter systems may comply with this requirement by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Receiving written verification from their gas source that the gas has the proper concentration of odorant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conducting periodic ``sniff'' tests at the extremities of the system to confirm that the gas contains odorant.
