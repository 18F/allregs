If after the first year of study, the SEA determines that unusual circumstances

justify waiver of the full-time attendance requirement, the scholar may enroll part time and continue to receive a scholarship payment. The SEA shall prorate the payment according to the scholar's enrollment status for the academic period during which he or she continues to be enrolled on a part-time basis but remains otherwise eligible for the award. For example, if a scholar for whom the full-time enrollment requirement is waived by the SEA is enrolled as a half-time student for one semester, he or she is eligible to receive one-quarter of his or her scholarship during that semester.
