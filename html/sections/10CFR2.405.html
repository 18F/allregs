                            <p class="depth0">At the conclusion of a hearing held under this subpart, the presiding officer will render a partial initial decision on the common design. The partial initial decision on the common design may be appealed under Sec. 2.341. If the proceedings have also been consolidated with respect to matters other than the common design under Sec. 2.317(b), the presiding officer may issue a consolidated partial initial decision for those proceedings. No construction permit, full-power operating license, or combined license under part 52 of this chapter will be issued until an initial decision has been issued on all phases of the hearing and all issues under the Act and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 appropriate to the proceeding have been resolved.</p>
