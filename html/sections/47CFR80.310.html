Noncommercial vessels,  such as recreational boats, may alternatively maintain a watch on  156.450 MHz (Channel 9) in lieu of VHF Channel 16 for call and reply  purposes. Voluntary vessels equipped with VHF-DSC equipment must  maintain a watch on 2182 kHz and on either 156.525 MHz (Channel 70) or  VHF Channel 16 aurally whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is  not being used to communicate. Voluntary vessels equipped with MF-HF DSC  equipment must have the radio turned on and set to an appropriate DSC  distress calling channel or one of the radiotelephone distress channels  whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to  communicate. Voluntary vessels equipped with a GMDSS-approved Inmarsat  system must have the unit turned on and set to receive calls whenever  the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate.
