                            <p class="depth0">An indemnity agreement for an international exhibition made under these regulations shall cover:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible items from outside the United States while on exhibition in the United States;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition outside this country, preferably when they are part of an exchange of exhibitions; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible items from the United States while on exhibition in the United States, in connection with other eligible items from outside the United States which are integral to the exhibition as a whole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Example. An American art museum is organizing a retrospective exhibition which will include more than 150 works of art by Impressionist painter Auguste Renoir. Museums in Paris and London have agreed to lend 125 works of art, covering every aspect of his career, many of which have not been seen together since the artist's death in 1919. The organizer is planning to include 25 masterpieces by Renoir from American public and private collections. The show will open in Chicago and travel to San Francisco and Washington.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Example.

This example is a common application for coverage of both foreign- and domestic-owned objects in an international exhibition. The foreign-owned objects are eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (a) of this section, and the domestic-owned objects may be eligible for indemnity coverage under paragraph (c) of this section if the foreign-owned objects are integral to the purposes of the exhibition as a whole. In reviewing this application, the Federal Council would evaluate the exhibition as a whole and determine whether the loans of 125 foreign-owned objects are integral to the educational, cultural, historical, or scientific significance of the exhibition on Renoir. It would also be necessary for the U.S. Department of State to determine whether or not the exhibition was in the national interest.
