                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculating the numerator and denominator. Performance under  each of the housing goals shall be measured using a fraction that is  converted into a percentage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The numerator. The numerator of each fraction is the number of  dwelling units financed by a GSE's mortgage purchases in a particular  year that count toward achievement of the housing goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The denominator. The denominator of each fraction is, for all  mortgages purchased, the number of dwelling units that could count  toward achievement of the goal under appropriate circumstances. The  denominator shall not include GSE transactions or activities that are  not mortgages or mortgage purchases as defined by HUD or transactions  that are specifically excluded as ineligible under Sec. 81.16(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Missing data or information. When a GSE lacks sufficient data or  information to determine whether the purchase of a mortgage originated  after 1992 counts toward achievement of a particular housing goal, that  mortgage purchase shall be included in the denominator for that housing  goal, except under the circumstances described in paragraphs (d) and  (e)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Properties with multiple dwelling units. For the purposes of  counting toward the achievement of the goals, whenever the property  securing a mortgage contains more than one dwelling unit, each such  dwelling unit shall be counted as a separate dwelling unit financed by a  mortgage purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit toward multiple goals. A mortgage purchase (or dwelling  unit financed by such purchase) by a GSE in a particular year shall  count toward the achievement of each housing goal for which such  purchase (or dwelling unit) qualifies in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Counting owner-occupied units. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of counting  owner-occupied units toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income  Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal, mortgage purchases  financing such units shall be evaluated based on the income of the  mortgagors and the area median income at the time of origination of the  mortgage. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a  particular family income level, i.e., especially low, very low, low or  moderate income, the income of the mortgagors is compared to the median  income for the area at the time of the mortgage application, using the  appropriate percentage factor provided under Sec. 81.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the income of the mortgagor(s) is not available to  determine whether an owner-occupied unit in a property securing a  single-family mortgage originated after 1992 and purchased by a GSE  counts toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal  or the Special Affordable Housing Goal, a GSE's performance with respect  to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information  in accordance with one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Excluding from the denominator and the numerator single-family  owner-occupied units located in census tracts with median incomes less  than, or equal to, area median income based on the most recent decennial  census, up to a maximum of one percent of the total number of single- family owner-occupied dwelling units eligible to be counted toward the  respective housing goal in the current year. Mortgage purchases with  missing data in excess of the maximum will be included in the  denominator and excluded from the numerator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For home purchase mortgages and for refinance mortgages  separately, multiplying the number of owner-occupied units with missing  borrower income information in properties securing mortgages purchased  by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all single-family  owner-occupied mortgage originations in the respective tracts that would  count toward achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the  most recent HMDA data available; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by  HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods  specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to estimate  affordability information for single-family owner-occupied units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a GSE chooses to use an estimation methodology under  paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) or (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section to determine  affordability for owner-occupied units in properties securing single- family mortgage purchases eligible to be counted toward the respective  housing goal, then that methodology may be used up to nationwide  maximums for home purchase mortgages and for refinance mortgages that  shall be calculated by multiplying, for each census tract, the  percentage of all single-family owner-occupied mortgage originations  with missing borrower incomes (as determined by HUD based on the most  recent HMDA data available for home purchase and refinance mortgages,  respectively) by the number of single-family owner-occupied units in  properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE for each census  tract, summed up over all census tracts. If this nationwide maximum is   exceeded, then the estimated number of goal-qualifying units will be  adjusted by the ratio of the applicable nationwide maximum number of  units for which income information may be estimated to the total number  of single-family owner-occupied units with missing income information in  properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE. Owner-occupied units  in excess of the nationwide maximum, and any units for which estimation  information is not available, shall remain in the denominator of the  respective goal calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Counting rental units--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of income, rent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally.  For purposes of counting rental units toward achievement of the Low- and  Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal,  mortgage purchases financing such units shall be evaluated based on the  income of actual or prospective tenants where such data is available,  i.e., known to a lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Availability of income information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each GSE shall require  lenders to provide to the GSE tenant income information under paragraphs  (e)(3) and (4) of this section, but only when such information is known  to the lender.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When such tenant income information is available for all  occupied units, the GSE's performance shall be based on the income of  the tenants in the occupied units. For unoccupied units that are vacant  and available for rent and for unoccupied units that are under repair or  renovation and not available for rent, the GSE shall use the income of  prospective tenants, if paragraph (e)(4) of this section is applicable.  If paragraph (e)(4) of this section is not applicable, the GSE shall use  rent levels for comparable units in the property to determine  affordability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Model units and rental offices. A model unit or rental office in  a multifamily property may count toward achievement of the housing goals  only if a GSE determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is reasonably expected that the units will be occupied by a  family within one year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The number of such units is reasonable and minimal considering  the size of the multifamily property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Such unit otherwise meets the requirements for the goal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Income of actual tenants. When the income of actual tenants is  available, to determine whether a tenant is very-low-, low-, or  moderate-income, the income of the tenant shall be compared to the  median income for the area, adjusted for family size as provided in  Sec. 81.17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Income of prospective tenants. When income for tenants is  available to a lender because a project is subject to a Federal housing  program that establishes the maximum income for a tenant or a  prospective tenant in rental units, the income of prospective tenants  may be counted at the maximum income level established under such  housing program for that unit. In determining the income of prospective  tenants, the income shall be projected based on the types of units and  market area involved. Where the income of prospective tenants is  projected, each GSE must determine that the income figures are  reasonable considering the rents (if any) on the same units in the past  and considering current rents on comparable units in the same market  area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use of rent. When the income of the prospective or actual  tenants of a dwelling unit is not available, performance under these  goals will be evaluated based on rent and whether the rent is affordable  to the income group targeted by the housing goal. A rent is affordable  if the rent does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of  very-low-, low-, or moderate-income families as provided in Sec. 81.19.  In determining contract rent for a dwelling unit, the actual rent or  average rent by unit type shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Affordability data unavailable. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multifamily. (A) When a GSE  lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a  property securing a multifamily mortgage purchased by a GSE counts  toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the  Special Affordable Housing Goal because neither the income of  prospective or actual tenants, nor the actual or average rental data,  are available, a GSE's performance with respect to such unit   may be evaluated using estimated affordability information in accordance  with one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the number of rental units with missing  affordability information in properties securing multifamily mortgages  purchased by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all  rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward  achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the most recent  decennial census. For units with missing affordability information in  tracts for which such methodology is not possible, such units will be  excluded from the denominator as well as the numerator in calculating  performance under the respective housing goal(s); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by  HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods  specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i)(A) of this section to estimate  affordability information for multifamily rental units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>,  and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall  be removed from the denominator of the respective goal calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rental units in 1-4 unit single-family properties. (A) When a  GSE lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a  property securing a single-family mortgage purchased by a GSE counts  toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the  Special Affordable Housing Goal because neither the income of  prospective or actual tenants, nor the actual or average rental data,  are available, a GSE's performance with respect to such unit may be  evaluated using estimated affordability information in accordance with  one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Excluding rental units in 1-to 4-unit properties with missing  affordability information from the denominator as well as the numerator  in calculating performance under those goals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying the number of rental units with missing  affordability information in properties securing single family mortgages  purchased by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all  rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward  achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the most recent  decennial census. For units with missing affordability information in  tracts for which such methodology is not possible, such units will be  excluded from the denominator as well as the numerator in calculating  performance under the respective housing goal(s); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by  HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods  specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section to estimate  affordability information for single-family rental units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, and any units for which estimation information is not  available, shall be removed from the denominator of the respective goal  calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Timeliness of information. In determining performance under the  housing goals, each GSE shall use tenant and rental information as of  the time of mortgage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acquisition for mortgages on multifamily housing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Origination for mortgages on single-family housing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Application of Median income. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of determining an  area's median income under Sec. Sec. 81.17 through 81.19 and for the  definition of ``low-income area,'' the area is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of  the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In all other areas, the county in which the property is  located, except that where the State nonmetropolitan median income is  higher than the county's median income, the area is the State  nonmetropolitan area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a GSE cannot precisely determine whether a mortgage is on  dwelling unit(s) located in one area, the GSE shall determine the median  income for the split area in the manner prescribed by the Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council for reporting under the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Act, if the GSE can determine that the mortgage is  on dwelling unit(s) located in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A census tract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A census place code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A block-group enumeration district;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A nine-digit zip code; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Another appropriate geographic segment that is partially located  in more than one area (``split area'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Sampling not permitted. Performance under the housing goals for  each year shall be based on a complete tabulation of mortgage purchases  for that year; a sampling of such purchases is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Newly available data. When a GSE uses data to determine whether  a mortgage purchase counts toward achievement of any goal and new data  is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the GSE need not use  the new data until the start of the following quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Counting mortgages toward the Home Purchase Subgoals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General. The requirements of this section, except for paragraphs (b) and  (e) of this section, shall apply to counting mortgages toward the Home  Purchase Subgoals at Sec. Sec. 81.12 through 81.14. However,  performance under the subgoals shall be counted using a fraction that is  converted into a percentage for each subgoal and the numerator of the  fraction for each subgoal shall be the number of home purchase mortgages  in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases in a  particular year that count towards achievement of the applicable housing  goal. The denominator of each fraction shall be the total number of home  purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage  purchases in a particular year. For purposes of each subgoal, the  procedure for addressing missing data or information, as set forth in  paragraph (d) of this section, shall be implemented using numbers of  home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas and not single-family  owner-occupied dwelling units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special counting rule for mortgages with more than one owner- occupied unit. For purposes of counting mortgages toward the Home  Purchase Subgoals, where a single home purchase mortgage finances the  purchase of two or more owner-occupied units in a metropolitan area, the  mortgage shall count   once toward each subgoal that applies to the GSE's mortgage purchase.
