Each locomotive or locomotive engine will be selected from  the end of the production line. Testing shall be performed throughout  the entire model year to the extent possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required sample size for an engine family is the lesser of  five tests per model year or one percent of projected annual production,  with a minimum sample size for an engine family of one test per model  year provided that no engine tested fails to meet applicable emission  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers and remanufacturers may elect to test additional  locomotives or locomotive engines. All additional locomotives or  locomotive engines must be tested in accordance with the applicable test  procedures of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer or remanufacturer must assemble the test  locomotives or locomotive engines using the same mass production process  that will be used for locomotives or locomotive engines to be introduced  into commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used  on any test locomotive or locomotive engine or any portion thereof,  including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be  used during the production and assembly of all other locomotives or  locomotive engines of that family, except with the approval of the  Administrator.</p>
