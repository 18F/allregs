(1) Each subject hospital is paid under the prospective payment system for operating costs for inpatient hospital services effective with the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and for inpatient capital-related costs effective with the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each subject hospital is paid under the prospective payment system for operating costs for inpatient hospital services effective with the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and for inpatient capital-related costs effective with the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hospital is paid the applicable prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs for each discharge occurring on or after the first day of its first cost reporting period subject to the applicable prospective payment system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a discharged beneficiary was admitted to the hospital before the first day of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, the reasonable costs of services furnished before that day are paid under the cost reimbursement provisions of part 413 of this chapter. For such discharges, the amount otherwise payable under the applicable prospective payment rate is reduced by the amount paid on a reasonable cost basis for inpatient hospital services furnished to that beneficiary during the hospital stay. If the amount paid under reasonable cost exceeds the inpatient operating prospective payment amount, the reduction is limited to the inpatient operating prospective payment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in cost reporting periods. CMS recognizes a change in a hospital's cost reporting period made after November 30, 1982 only if the change has been requested in writing by the hospital and approved by the intermediary in accordance with Sec. 413.24(f)(3) of this chapter.
