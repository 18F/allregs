                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Addition to the tax--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to file tax return. In the case  of failure to file a return required under authority of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Title 26 U.S.C. 61, relating to returns and records;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Title 26 U.S.C. 51, relating to distilled spirits, wines and  beer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Title 26 U.S.C. 52, relating to tobacco products, and  cigarette papers and tubes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Title 26 U.S.C. 53, relating to machine guns, destructive  devices, and certain other firearms; and the regulations thereunder, on  or before the date prescribed for filing (determined with regard to any  extension of time for such filing), there shall be added to the tax  required to be shown on the return the amount specified below unless the  failure to file the return within the prescribed time is shown to the  satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer to be due to reasonable  cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 5  percent therof if the failure is not for more than one month, with an  additional 5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the  aggregate. The amount of any addition under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section for any month to which an addition to tax applies  under both paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay  the amount shown as tax on any return required to be filed after  December 31, 1969 (without regard to any extension of time for filing  thereof), specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on or before  the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with regard to  any extension of time for payment), there shall be added to the tax  shown on the return the amount specified below unless the failure to pay  the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the  appropriate TTB officer to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful  neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount  of tax shown on the return if the failure is for not more than 1 month,  with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction  thereof during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent  in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to pay tax not shown on return. In case of failure to  pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return  specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which is not so shown  (including an assessment made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6213(b)) within 10  days from the date of the notice and demand therefor, there shall be  added to the amount shown in the notice and demand the amount specified  below unless the failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is  shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer to be due to  reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to be added to  the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount stated in the notice and demand if  the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional 0.5  percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the  failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The  maximum amount of the addition permitted under this subparagraph shall  be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and  demand is made and which is not paid within 10 days from the date of  notice and demand. The preceding sentence applies to amounts assessed on  or before December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Increases in penalties in certain cases. For increases in  penalties for failure to file a return or pay tax in certain cases, see  26 U.S.C. 6651(d) or (f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Month defined. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the date prescribed for filing the return  or paying tax is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding  calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or  pay tax continues shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax is a  date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period which  terminates with the   date numerically corresponding thereto in the succeeding calendar month  and each such successive period shall constitute a month for purposes of  section 6651. If, in the month of February, there is no date  corresponding to the date prescribed for filing the return or paying  tax, the period from such date in January through the last day of  February shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651. Thus, if  a return is due on January 30, the first month shall end on February 28  (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding months shall end on March 30,  April 30, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a return is not timely filed or tax is not timely paid, the  fact that the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax, or  the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a  Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is immaterial in determining the  number of months for which the addition to the tax under section 6651  applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Showing of reasonable cause. A taxpayer who wishes to avoid the  addition to the tax for failure to file a tax return or pay tax must  make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a reasonable cause  for the taxpayers failure to file such return or pay such tax on time in  the form of a written statement containing a declaration that it is made  under penalties of perjury. Such statement should be filed with the  appropriate TTB officer. In addition, where special tax returns are  delivered to an appropriate TTB officer, such statement may be delivered  with the return. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the  delinquency was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful neglect,  the addition to the tax will not be assessed. If the taxpayer exercised  ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file  the return within the prescribed time, then the delay is due to a  reasonable cause. A failure to pay will be considered to be due to  reasonable cause to the extent that the taxpayer has made a satisfactory  showing that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence  in providing for payment of the tax liability and was nevertheless  either unable to pay the tax or would suffer an undue hardship (as  described in 26 CFR 1.6161-1(b)) if paid on the due date. In determining  whether the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax in spite of the exercise  of ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of a tax  liability, consideration will be given to all the facts and  circumstances of the taxpayer's financial situation, including the  amount and nature of the taxpayer's expenditures in light of the income  (or other amounts) the taxpayer could, at the time of such expenditures,  reasonably expect to receive prior to the date prescribed for the  payment of the tax. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who incurs lavish or  extravagant living expenses in an amount such that the remainder of  assets and anticipated income will be insufficient to pay the tax, has  not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the  payment of a tax liability. Further, a taxpayer who invests funds in  speculative or illiquid assets has not exercised ordinary business care  and prudence in providing for the payment of a tax liability unless, at  the time of the investment, the remainder of the taxpayer's assets and  estimated income will be sufficient to pay the tax or it can be  reasonably foreseen that the speculative or illiquid investment made by  the taxpayer can be utilized (by sale or as security for a loan) to  realize sufficient funds to satisfy the tax liability. A taxpayer will  be considered to have exercised ordinary business care and prudence if  such taxpayer made reasonable efforts to conserve sufficient assets in  marketable form to satisfy a tax liability and nevertheless was unable  to pay all or a portion of the tax when it became due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Penalty imposed on net amount due--(1) Credits against the tax.  The amount of tax required to be shown on the return for purposes of  section 6651(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and the amount shown as tax on the return for  purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall be reduced by the amount of any  part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which  may be claimed on the return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Partial payments. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of tax required to be shown on  the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue  Code shall, for   the purpose of computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the  amount of any part of the tax which is paid after the date prescribed  for payment and on or before the first day of such month, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of tax stated in the notice and demand for purposes  of section 6651(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code shall, for the  purpose of computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the  amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the first day of such  month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No addition to tax if fraud penalty assessed. No addition to the  tax under section 6651 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be assessed  with respect to an underpayment of tax if an addition to the tax for  fraud is assessed with respect to the same underpayment under section  6653(b). See section 6653(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.  (26 U.S.C. 6651)  [T.D. ATF-251, 52 FR 19314, May 22, 1987, as amended by T.D ATF-301, 55  FR 47614, Nov. 14, 1990; T.D.
