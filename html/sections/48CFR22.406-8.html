                            <p class="depth0">Conduct labor standards investigations when available information  indicates such action is warranted. In addition, the Department of Labor  may conduct an investigation on its own initiative or may request a  contracting agency to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contracting agency responsibilities. Conduct an investigation  when a compliance check indicates that substantial or willful violations  may have occurred or violations have not been corrected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The investigation must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include all aspects of the contractor's compliance with contract  labor standards requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not be limited to specific areas raised in a complaint or  uncovered during compliance checks; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use personnel familiar with labor laws and their application  to contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not disclose contractor employees' oral or written statements  taken during an investigation or the employee's identity to anyone other  than an authorized Government official without that employee's prior  signed consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Send a written request to the Administrator, Wage and Hour  Division, to obtain--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Investigation and enforcement instructions; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Available pertinent Department of Labor files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain permission from the Department of Labor before disclosing  material obtained from Labor Department files, other than computations  of back wages and liquidated damages and summaries of back wages due, to  anyone other than Government contract administrators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investigation report. The contracting officer must review the  investigation report on receipt and make preliminary findings. The  contracting officer normally must not base adverse findings solely on  employee statements that the employee does not wish to have disclosed.  However, if the investigation establishes a pattern of possible  violations that are based on employees' statements that are not  authorized for disclosure, the pattern itself may support a finding of  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor notification. After completing the review, the  contracting officer must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the contractor any written preliminary findings and  proposed corrective actions, and notice that the contractor has the  right to request that the basis for the findings be made available and  to submit written rebuttal information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon request, provide the contractor with rationale for the  findings. However, under no circumstances will the contracting officer  permit the contractor to examine the investigation report. Also, the  contracting officer must not disclose the identity of any employee who  filed a complaint or who was interviewed, without the prior consent of  the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contractor may rebut the findings in writing within 60  days after it receives a copy of the preliminary findings. The rebuttal  becomes part of the official investigation record. If the contractor  submits a rebuttal, evaluate the preliminary findings and notify the  contractor of the final findings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the contracting officer does not receive a timely rebuttal,  the contracting officer must consider the preliminary findings final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If appropriate, request the contractor to make restitution for  underpaid wages and assess liquidated damages. If the request includes  liquidated damages, the request must state that the contractor has 60  days to request relief from such assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracting officer's report. After taking the actions  prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer must prepare and forward a report of any  violations, including findings and supporting evidence, to the agency  head. Standard Form 1446, Labor Standards Investigation Summary Sheet,  is the first page of the report; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency head must process the report as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer must send a detailed enforcement report  to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, within 60 days after  completion of the investigation, if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A contractor or subcontractor underpaid by $1,000 or more;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The contracting officer believes that the violations are  aggravated or willful (or there is reason to believe that the contractor  has disregarded its obligations to employees and subcontractors under  the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The contractor or subcontractor has not made restitution; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Future compliance has not been assured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Department of Labor expressly requested the  investigation and none of the conditions in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  subsection exist, submit a summary report to the Administrator, Wage and  Hour Division.

Notify the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, when the report is  forwarded for the Attorney General's consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Department of Labor investigations. The Department of Labor will  furnish the contracting officer an enforcement report detailing  violations found and any corrective action taken by the contractor, in  investigations that disclose--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Underpayments totaling $1,000 or more;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aggravated or willful violations (or, when the contracting  officer believes that the contractor has disregarded its obligations to  employees and subcontractors under the Construction Wage Rate  Requirements statute); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Potential assessment of liquidated damages under the Contract  Work Hours and Safety Standards statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other investigations.
