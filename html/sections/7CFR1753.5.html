This does not relieve the borrower of the requirements of  bidding or bid evaluation set contained in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RUS approval of the borrower's award of the contract is required  for all other competitively-bid and for negotiated major construction  contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirements and procedures for sealed competitive bidding  are presented in Sec. 1753.8(a). The requirements and procedures for  negotiation are presented in Sec. 1753.8(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Force account construction. To obtain RUS approval of the force  account method for major construction the borrower must demonstrate its  ability to perform major construction based on past force account  construction which fully met RUS construction standards and was as cost- effective as contract construction in the area. If the borrower has no  record of past performance to support its request, but has adequate  equipment and experienced personnel to perform the proposed  construction, RUS may approve a small trial project. The requirements  and procedures for force account construction are presented in subparts  D, E, G, and H.  [54 FR 39267, Sept. 25, 1989.
