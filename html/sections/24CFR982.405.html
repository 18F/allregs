The PHA may establish a reasonable fee to owners for a reinspection if an owner notifies the PHA that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible for repairing pursuant to Sec. 982.404(a) was not corrected. The owner may not pass this fee along to the family. Fees collected under this paragraph will be included in a PHA's administrative fee reserve and may be used only for activities related to the provision of Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If a participant family or government official reports a condition that is life-threatening (i.e., the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 24 hours in accordance with Sec. 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the housing unit within 24 hours of when the PHA received the notification. If the reported condition is not life-threatening (i.e., the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 30 calendar days in accordance with Sec. 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the unit within 15 days of when the PHA received the notification. In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a Presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may waive the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.</p>
