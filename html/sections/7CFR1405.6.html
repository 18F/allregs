                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for any benefits or payments under 7 CFR part  1410 the producer must obtain at least the catastrophic level of  insurance for each crop of economic significance in which the producer  has an interest or provide a written waiver to the Secretary that waives  any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with  the crop, if insurance is available in the county for the crop. In  meeting this requirement, the producer may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance in all  counties for each crop of economic significance in which the producer  has an interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain at least the catastrophic level of crop insurance for  some, but not all, crops of economic significance for which the producer  has an interest, and sign a waiver; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sign a waiver that waives any eligibility for crop loss  assistance in connection with the producer's crop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crop of economic significance. The term ``crop of economic  significance'' means a crop that has contributed in the previous year,  or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, 10 percent or  more of the total expected value of all crops grown by the producer.  However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the total expected  liability under the catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to  or less than the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop  will not be considered a crop of economic significance.
