The substance so tagged shall be kept separate from other substances as  the circuit supervisor may require and shall not be used until the tag  is removed, and such removal shall be made only by a Program employee  after a finding that the substance can be accepted, or, in the case of  an unacceptable substance, when it is removed from the establishment.</p>
