                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant  each request for records or a fee waiver shall be made by the Executive  Director within 10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public  holidays) after receipt of that request. The person making the request  shall be notified as soon as the determination is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. If the material requested is not a type  described in Sec. 51-8.2(a), or is the subject of one or more  exemptions, the request may be denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a determination is made to grant a request, the relevant  material shall be furnished as soon as possible following the  determination to grant the request, and after payment of the fee  specified in Sec. 51-8.12 when required, except that copies of less  than 10 pages of material requested in person ordinarily will be  furnished immediately following the determination to grant the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where portions of the requested material are exempt under Sec.  51-8.2(b), and are reasonably segregable from the remainder of the  material, those portions shall be excised from the materials disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a determination is made to deny a request, or a portion  thereof, the notification shall include a statement of the reasons for  such action, shall set forth the name and position of the person  responsible for the denial, and shall advise the requester of the right,  and the procedures required under Sec. 51-8.10 to appeal the denial to  the Chairperson.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Committee will require prepayment of fees for search,  review, and reproduction which are likely to exceed $250.00. When the  anticipated total fee exceeds $250.00, the requester will receive notice  to prepay and at the same time will be given an opportunity to modify  his or her request to reduce the fee. The Committee will also inform the  requester that fees for search time will be charged even if the search  proves unsuccessful. The Committee will not start processing a request  until payment is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whenever duplication fees or search fees are anticipated to  exceed $25.00, but not more than $250.00 and the requester has not  indicated, in advance, a willingness to pay fees as high as those  anticipated, the Committee will notify the requester of the amount of  the anticipated fee. Similarly, where an extensive and therefore costly  successful search is anticipated, the Committee will notify requesters  of the anticipated fees. The Committee will not start processing the  request until assurance of payment is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Photocopies and directives furnished to the public are  restricted to one copy of each page.
