Sec. Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 763--Interim Transmission Electron Microscopy Analytical Methods--Mandatory and Nonmandatory--and Mandatory</p><p class="depth0">Section To Determine Completion of Response Actions</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">The following appendix contains three units. The first unit is the mandatory transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method which all laboratories must follow; it is the minimum requirement for analysis of air samples for asbestos by TEM. The mandatory method contains the essential elements of the TEM method. The second unit contains the complete non-mandatory method. The non-mandatory method supplements the mandatory method by including additional steps to improve the analysis. EPA recommends that the non-mandatory method be employed for analyzing air filters; however, the laboratory may choose to employ the mandatory method. The non-mandatory method contains the same minimum requirements as are outlined in the mandatory method. Hence, laboratories may choose either of the two methods for analyzing air samples by TEM.</p><p class="depth0">The final unit of this Appendix A to subpart E defines the steps which must be taken to determine completion of response actions. This unit is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0">II. Mandatory Transmission Electron Microscopy Method</p><p class="depth0">A. Definitions of Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Analytical sensitivity--Airborne asbestos concentration represented by each fiber counted under the electron microscope. It is determined by the air volume collected and the proportion of the filter examined. This method requires that the analytical sensitivity be no greater than 0.005 structures/cm\3\.</p><p class="depth0">2. Asbestiform--A specific type of mineral fibrosity in which the fibers and fibrils possess high tensile strength and flexibility.</p><p class="depth0">3. Aspect ratio--A ratio of the length to the width of a particle. Minimum aspect ratio as defined by this method is equal to or greater than 5:1.</p><p class="depth0">4. Bundle--A structure composed of three or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clean area--A controlled environment which is maintained and monitored to assure a low probability of asbestos contamination to materials in that space. Clean areas used in this method have HEPA filtered air under positive pressure and are capable of sustained operation with an open laboratory blank which on subsequent analysis has an average of less than 18 structures/mm\2\ in an area of 0.057 mm\2\ (nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a maximum of 53 structures/mm\2\ for any single preparation for that same area.</p><p class="depth0">6. Cluster--A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group. Groupings must have more than two intersections.</p><p class="depth0">7. ED--Electron diffraction.</p><p class="depth0">8. EDXA--Energy dispersive X-ray analysis.</p><p class="depth0">9. Fiber--A structure greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m in length with an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and having substantially parallel sides.</p><p class="depth0">10. Grid--An open structure for mounting on the sample to aid in its examination in the TEM. The term is used here to denote a 200-mesh copper lattice approximately 3 mm in diameter.</p><p class="depth0">11. Intersection--Nonparallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio of 5:1 or greater.</p><p class="depth0">12. Laboratory sample coordinator--That person responsible for the conduct of sample handling and the certification of the testing procedures.</p><p class="depth0">13. Filter background level--The concentration of structures per square millimeter of filter that is considered indistinguishable from the concentration measured on a blank (filters through which no air has been drawn). For this method the filter background level is defined as 70 structures/mm\2\.</p><p class="depth0">14. Matrix--Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.</p><p class="depth0">15. NSD--No structure detected.</p><p class="depth0">16. Operator--A person responsible for the TEM instrumental analysis of the sample.</p><p class="depth0">17. PCM--Phase contrast microscopy.</p><p class="depth0">18. SAED--Selected area electron diffraction.</p><p class="depth0">19. SEM--Scanning electron microscope.</p><p class="depth0">20. STEM--Scanning transmission electron microscope.</p><p class="depth0">21. Structure--a microscopic bundle, cluster, fiber, or matrix which may contain asbestos.</p><p class="depth0">22. S/cm\3\--Structures per cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth0">23. S/mm\2\--Structures per square millimeter.</p><p class="depth0">24. TEM--Transmission electron microscope.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sampling</p><p class="depth0">1. The sampling agency must have written quality control procedures and documents which verify compliance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sampling operations must be performed by qualified individuals completely independent of the abatement contractor to avoid possible conflict of interest (References 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Unit II.J.).</p><p class="depth0">3. Sampling for airborne asbestos following an abatement action must use commercially available cassettes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prescreen the loaded cassette collection filters to assure that they do not contain concentrations of asbestos which may interfere with the analysis of the sample. A filter blank average of less than 18 s/mm\2\ in an area of 0.057 mm\2\ (nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a single preparation with a maximum of 53 s/mm\2\ for that same area is acceptable for this method.</p><p class="depth0">5. Use sample collection filters which are either polycarbonate having a pore size less than or equal to 0.4 [micro]m or mixed cellulose ester having a pore size less than or equal to 0.45 [micro]m.</p><p class="depth0">6. Place these filters in series with a 5.0 [micro]m backup filter (to serve as a diffuser) and a support pad. See the following Figure 1:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.001</p><p class="depth0">7. Reloading of used cassettes is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">8. Orient the cassette downward at approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal.</p><p class="depth0">9. Maintain a log of all pertinent sampling information.</p><p class="depth0">10. Calibrate sampling pumps and their flow indicators over the range of their intended use with a recognized standard. Assemble the sampling system with a representative filter (not the filter which will be used in sampling) before and after the sampling operation.</p><p class="depth0">11. Record all calibration information.</p><p class="depth0">12. Ensure that the mechanical vibrations from the pump will be minimized to prevent transferral of vibration to the cassette.</p><p class="depth0">13. Ensure that a continuous smooth flow of negative pressure is delivered by the pump by damping out any pump action fluctuations if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">14. The final plastic barrier around the abatement area remains in place for the sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">15. After the area has passed a thorough visual inspection, use aggressive sampling conditions to dislodge any remaining dust. (See suggested protocol in Unit III.B.7.d.)</p><p class="depth0">16. Select an appropriate flow rate equal to or greater than 1 liter per minute (L/min) or less than 10 L/min for 25 mm cassettes. Larger filters may be operated at proportionally higher flow rates.</p><p class="depth0">17. A minimum of 13 samples are to be collected for each testing site consisting of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. A minimum of five samples per abatement area.</p><p class="depth0">b. A minimum of five samples per ambient area positioned at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site.</p><p class="depth0">c. Two field blanks are to be taken by removing the cap for not more than 30 seconds and replacing it at the time of sampling before sampling is initiated at the following places:</p><p class="depth0">i. Near the entrance to each abatement area.</p><p class="depth0">ii. At one of the ambient sites. (DO NOT leave the field blanks open during the sampling period.)</p><p class="depth0">d. A sealed blank is to be carried with each sample set. This representative cassette is not to be opened in the field.</p><p class="depth0">18. Perform a leak check of the sampling system at each indoor and outdoor sampling site by activating the pump with the closed sampling cassette in line. Any flow indicates a leak which must be eliminated before initiating the sampling operation.</p><p class="depth0">19. The following Table I specifies volume ranges to be used:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.002</p><p class="depth0">20. Ensure that the sampler is turned upright before interrupting the pump flow.</p><p class="depth0">21. Check that all samples are clearly labeled and that all pertinent information has been enclosed before transfer of the samples to the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">22. Ensure that the samples are stored in a secure and representative location.</p><p class="depth0">23. Do not change containers if portions of these filters are taken for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">24. A summary of Sample Data Quality Objectives is shown in the following Table II:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.003</p><p class="depth0">C. Sample Shipment</p><p class="depth0">Ship bulk samples to the analytical laboratory in a separate container from air samples.</p><p class="depth0">D. Sample Receiving</p><p class="depth0">1. Designate one individual as sample coordinator at the laboratory. While that individual will normally be available to receive samples, the coordinator may train and supervise others in receiving procedures for those times when he/she is not available.</p><p class="depth0">2. Bulk samples and air samples delivered to the analytical laboratory in the same container shall be rejected.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0">1. All sample preparation and analysis shall be performed by a laboratory independent of the abatement contractor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Wet-wipe the exterior of the cassettes to minimize contamination possibilities before taking them into the clean room facility.</p><p class="depth0">3. Perform sample preparation in a well-equipped clean facility.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The clean area is required to have the following minimum characteristics. The area or hood must be capable of maintaining a positive pressure with make-up air being HEPA-filtered. The cumulative analytical blank concentration must average less than 18 s/mm\2\ in an area of 0.057 mm\2\ (nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a single preparation with a maximum of 53 s/mm\2\ for that same area.</p><p class="depth0">4. Preparation areas for air samples must not only be separated from preparation areas for bulk samples, but they must be prepared in separate rooms.</p><p class="depth0">5. Direct preparation techniques are required. The object is to produce an intact film containing the particulates of the filter surface which is sufficiently clear for TEM analysis.</p><p class="depth0">a. TEM Grid Opening Area measurement must be done as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. The filter portion being used for sample preparation must have the surface collapsed using an acetone vapor technique.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Measure 20 grid openings on each of 20 random 200-mesh copper grids by placing a grid on a glass and examining it under the PCM. Use a calibrated graticule to measure the average field diameters. From the data, calculate the field area for an average grid opening.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Measurements can also be made on the TEM at a properly calibrated low magnification or on an optical microscope at a magnification of approximately 400X by using an eyepiece fitted with a scale that has been calibrated against a stage micrometer. Optical microscopy utilizing manual or automated procedures may be used providing instrument calibration can be verified.</p><p class="depth0">b. TEM specimen preparation from polycarbonate (PC) filters. Procedures as described in Unit III.G. or other equivalent methods may be used.</p><p class="depth0">c. TEM specimen preparation from mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters.</p><p class="depth0">i. Filter portion being used for sample preparation must have the surface collapsed using an acetone vapor technique or the Burdette procedure (Ref. 7 of Unit II.J.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Plasma etching of the collapsed filter is required. The microscope slide to which the collapsed filter pieces are attached is placed in a plasma asher. Because plasma ashers vary greatly in their performance, both from unit to unit and between different positions in the asher chamber, it is difficult to specify the conditions that should be used. Insufficient etching will result in a failure to expose embedded filters, and too much etching may result in loss of particulate from the surface. As an interim measure, it is recommended that the time for ashing of a

known weight of a collapsed filter be established and that the etching rate be calculated in terms of micrometers per second. The actual etching time used for the particulate asher and operating conditions will then be set such that a 1-2 [micro]m (10 percent) layer of collapsed surface will be removed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Procedures as described in Unit III. or other equivalent methods may be used to prepare samples.</p><p class="depth0">F. TEM Method</p><p class="depth0">1. An 80-120 kV TEM capable of performing electron diffraction with a fluorescent screen inscribed with calibrated gradations is required. If the TEM is equipped with EDXA it must either have a STEM attachment or be capable of producing a spot less than 250 nm in diameter at crossover. The microscope shall be calibrated routinely for magnification and camera constant.</p><p class="depth0">2. Determination of Camera Constant and ED Pattern Analysis. The camera length of the TEM in ED operating mode must be calibrated before ED patterns on unknown samples are observed. This can be achieved by using a carbon-coated grid on which a thin film of gold has been sputtered or evaporated. A thin film of gold is evaporated on the specimen TEM grid to obtain zone-axis ED patterns superimposed with a ring pattern from the polycrystalline gold film. In practice, it is desirable to optimize the thickness of the gold film so that only one or two sharp rings are obtained on the superimposed ED pattern. Thicker gold film would normally give multiple gold rings, but it will tend to mask weaker diffraction spots from the unknown fibrous particulate. Since the unknown d-spacings of most interest in asbestos analysis are those which lie closest to the transmitted beam, multiple gold rings are unnecessary on zone-axis ED patterns. An average camera constant using multiple gold rings can be determined. The camera constant is one-half the diameter of the rings times the interplanar spacing of the ring being measured.</p><p class="depth0">3. Magnification Calibration. The magnification calibration must be done at the fluorescent screen. The TEM must be calibrated at the grid opening magnification (if used) and also at the magnification used for fiber counting. This is performed with a cross grating replica (e.g., one containing 2,160 lines/mm). Define a field of view on the fluorescent screen either by markings or physical boundaries. The field of view must be measurable or previously inscribed with a scale or concentric circles (all scales should be metric). A logbook must be maintained, and the dates of calibration and the values obtained must be recorded. The frequency of calibration depends on the past history of the particular microscope. After any maintenance of the microscope that involved adjustment of the power supplied to the lenses or the high-voltage system or the mechanical disassembly of the electron optical column apart from filament exchange, the magnification must be recalibrated. Before the TEM calibration is performed, the analyst must ensure that the cross grating replica is placed at the same distance from the objective lens as the specimens are. For instruments that incorporate a eucentric tilting specimen stage, all specimens and the cross grating replica must be placed at the eucentric position.</p><p class="depth0">4. While not required on every microscope in the laboratory, the laboratory must have either one microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis or access to an equivalent system on a TEM in another laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">5. Microscope settings: 80-120 kV, grid assessment 250-1,000X, then 15,000-20,000X screen magnification for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">6. Approximately one-half (0.5) of the predetermined sample area to be analyzed shall be performed on one sample grid preparation and the remaining half on a second sample grid preparation.</p><p class="depth0">7. Individual grid openings with greater than 5 percent openings (holes) or covered with greater than 25 percent particulate matter or obviously having nonuniform loading must not be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">8. Reject the grid if:</p><p class="depth0">a. Less than 50 percent of the grid openings covered by the replica are intact.</p><p class="depth0">b. The replica is doubled or folded.</p><p class="depth0">c. The replica is too dark because of incomplete dissolution of the filter.</p><p class="depth0">9. Recording Rules.</p><p class="depth0">a. Any continuous grouping of particles in which an asbestos fiber with an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 5:1 and a length greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m is detected shall be recorded on the count sheet. These will be designated asbestos structures and will be classified as fibers, bundles, clusters, or matrices. Record as individual fibers any contiguous grouping having 0, 1, or 2 definable intersections. Groupings having more than 2 intersections are to be described as cluster or matrix. An intersection is a nonparallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio of 5:1 or greater. See the following Figure 2:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.004



[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.005</p><p class="depth0">i. Fiber. A structure having a minimum length greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Bundle. A structure composed of three or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Cluster. A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group. Groupings must have more than two intersections.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Matrix. Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.</p><p class="depth0">b. Separate categories will be maintained for fibers less than 5 [micro]m and for fibers equal to or greater than 5 [micro]m in length.</p><p class="depth0">c. Record NSD when no structures are detected in the field.</p><p class="depth0">d. Visual identification of electron diffraction (ED) patterns is required for each asbestos structure counted which would cause the

analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration. (Generally this means the first four fibers identified as asbestos must exhibit an identifiable diffraction pattern for chrysotile or amphibole.)</p><p class="depth0">e. The micrograph number of the recorded diffraction patterns must be reported to the client and maintained in the laboratory's quality assurance records. In the event that examination of the pattern by a qualified individual indicates that the pattern has been misidentified visually, the client shall be contacted.</p><p class="depth0">f. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDXA) is required of all amphiboles which would cause the analysis results to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration. (Generally speaking, the first 4 amphiboles would require EDXA.)</p><p class="depth0">g. If the number of fibers in the nonasbestos class would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration, the fact that they are not asbestos must be confirmed by EDXA or measurement of a zone axis diffraction pattern.</p><p class="depth0">h. Fibers classified as chrysotile must be identified by diffraction or X-ray analysis and recorded on a count sheet. X-ray analysis alone can be used only after 70 s/mm\2\ have been exceeded for a particular sample.</p><p class="depth0">i. Fibers classified as amphiboles must be identified by X-ray analysis and electron diffraction and recorded on the count sheet. (X-ray analysis alone can be used only after 70 s/mm\2\ have been exceeded for a particular sample.)</p><p class="depth0">j. If a diffraction pattern was recorded on film, record the micrograph number on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0">k. If an electron diffraction was attempted but no pattern was observed, record N on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0">l. If an EDXA spectrum was attempted but not observed, record N on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0">m. If an X-ray analysis spectrum is stored, record the file and disk number on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0">10. Classification Rules.</p><p class="depth0">a. Fiber. A structure having a minimum length greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed.</p><p class="depth0">b. Bundle. A structure composed of three or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.</p><p class="depth0">c. Cluster. A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group. Groupings must have more than two intersections.</p><p class="depth0">d. Matrix. Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.</p><p class="depth0">11. After finishing with a grid, remove it from the microscope, and replace it in the appropriate grid holder. Sample grids must be stored for a minimum of 1 year from the date of the analysis; the sample cassette must be retained for a minimum of 30 days by the laboratory or returned at the client's request.</p><p class="depth0">G. Sample Analytical Sequence</p><p class="depth0">1. Under the present sampling requirements a minimum of 13 samples is to be collected for the clearance testing of an abatement site. These include five abatement area samples, five ambient samples, two field blanks, and one sealed blank.</p><p class="depth0">2. Carry out visual inspection of work site prior to air monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">3. Collect a minimum of 5 air samples inside the work site and 5 samples outside the work site. The indoor and outdoor samples shall be taken during the same time period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Remaining steps in the analytical sequence are contained in Unit IV of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">H. Reporting</p><p class="depth0">1. The following information must be reported to the client for each sample analyzed:</p><p class="depth0">a. Concentration in structures per square millimeter and structures per cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth0">b. Analytical sensitivity used for the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">c. Number of asbestos structures.</p><p class="depth0">d. Area analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">e. Volume of air sampled (which must be initially supplied to lab by client).</p><p class="depth0">f. Copy of the count sheet must be included with the report.</p><p class="depth0">g. Signature of laboratory official to indicate that the laboratory met specifications of the method.</p><p class="depth0">h. Report form must contain official laboratory identification (e.g., letterhead).</p><p class="depth0">i. Type of asbestos.</p><p class="depth0">I. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality</p><p class="depth0">Indicators)</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards are to be performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the

operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the following Table III:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.006</p><p class="depth0">1. When the samples arrive at the laboratory, check the samples and documentation for completeness and requirements before initiating the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2. Check all laboratory reagents and supplies for acceptable asbestos background levels.</p><p class="depth0">3. Conduct all sample preparation in a clean room environment monitored by laboratory blanks. Testing with blanks must also be done after cleaning or servicing the room.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prepare multiple grids of each sample.</p><p class="depth0">5. Provide laboratory blanks with each sample batch. Maintain a cumulative average of these results. If there are more than 53 fibers/mm\2\ per 10 200-mesh grid openings, the system must be checked for possible sources of contamination.</p><p class="depth0">6. Perform a system check on the transmission electron microscope daily.</p><p class="depth0">7.

Validate all data entries.</p><p class="depth0">10. Recalculate a percentage of all computations and automatic data reduction steps as specified in Table III under Unit II.I.</p><p class="depth0">11. Record an electron diffraction pattern of one asbestos structure from every five samples that contain asbestos. Verify the identification of the pattern by measurement or comparison of the pattern with patterns collected from standards under the same conditions. The records must also demonstrate that the identification of the pattern has been verified by a qualified individual and that the operator who made the identification is maintaining at least an 80 percent correct visual identification based on his measured patterns.</p><p class="depth0">12. Appropriate logs or records must be maintained by the analytical laboratory verifying that it is in compliance with the mandatory quality assurance procedures.</p><p class="depth0">J.

Sampling</p><p class="depth0">1. Sampling operations must be performed by qualified individuals completely independent of the abatement contractor to avoid possible conflict of interest (See References 1, 2, and 5 of Unit III.L.) Special precautions should be taken to avoid contamination of the sample. For example, materials that have not been prescreened for their asbestos background content should not be used; also, sample handling procedures which do not take cross contamination possibilities into account should not be used.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material and supply checks for asbestos contamination should be made on all critical supplies, reagents, and procedures before their use in a monitoring study.</p><p class="depth0">3. Quality control and quality assurance steps are needed to identify problem areas and isolate the cause of the contamination (see Reference 5 of Unit III.L.). Control checks shall be permanently recorded to document the quality of the information produced. The sampling firm must have written quality control procedures and documents which verify compliance. Independent audits by a qualified consultant or firm should be performed once a year. All documentation of compliance should be retained indefinitely to provide a guarantee of quality. A summary of Sample Data Quality Objectives is shown in Table II of Unit II.B.</p><p class="depth0">4. Sampling materials.</p><p class="depth0">a. Sample for airborne asbestos following an abatement action using commercially available cassettes.</p><p class="depth0">b. Use either a cowling or a filter-retaining middle piece. Conductive material may reduce the potential for particulates to adhere to the walls of the cowl.</p><p class="depth0">c. Cassettes must be verified as ``clean'' prior to use in the field. If packaged filters are used for loading or preloaded cassettes are purchased from the manufacturer or a distributor, the manufacturer's name and lot number should be entered on all field data sheets provided to the laboratory, and are required to be listed on all reports from the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">d. Assemble the cassettes in a clean facility (See definition of clean area under Unit III.A.).</p><p class="depth0">e. Reloading of used cassettes is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">f. Use sample collection filters which are either polycarbonate having a pore size of less than or equal to 0.4 [micro]m or mixed cellulose ester having a pore size of less than or equal to 0.45 [micro]m.</p><p class="depth0">g. Place these filters in series with a backup filter with a pore size of 5.0 [micro]m (to serve as a diffuser) and a support pad. See the following Figure 1:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.007</p><p class="depth0">h. When polycarbonate filters are used, position the highly reflective face such that the incoming particulate is received on this surface.</p><p class="depth0">i. Seal the cassettes to prevent leakage around the filter edges or between cassette part joints. A mechanical press may be useful to achieve a reproducible leak-free seal.

Shrink fit gel-bands may be used for this purpose and are available from filter manufacturers and their authorized distributors.</p><p class="depth0">j. Use wrinkle-free loaded cassettes in the sampling operation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Pump setup.</p><p class="depth0">a. Calibrate the sampling pump over the range of flow rates and loads anticipated for the monitoring period with this flow measuring device in series. Perform this calibration using guidance from EPA Method 2A each time the unit is sent to the field (See Reference 6 of Unit III.L.).</p><p class="depth0">b. Configure the sampling system to preclude pump vibrations from being transmitted to the cassette by using a sampling stand separate from the pump station and making connections with flexible tubing.</p><p class="depth0">c. Maintain continuous smooth flow conditions by damping out any pump action fluctuations if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">d. Check the sampling system for leaks with the end cap still in place and the pump operating before initiating sample collection. Trace and stop the source of any flow indicated by the flowmeter under these conditions.</p><p class="depth0">e. Select an appropriate flow rate equal to or greater than 1 L/min or less than 10 L/min for 25 mm cassettes. Larger filters may be operated at proportionally higher flow rates.</p><p class="depth0">f. Orient the cassette downward at approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal.</p><p class="depth0">g. Maintain a log of all pertinent sampling information, such as pump identification number, calibration data, sample location, date, sample identification number, flow rates at the beginning, middle, and end, start and stop times, and other useful information or comments. Use of a sampling log form is recommended. See the following Figure 2:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.008</p><p class="depth0">h. Initiate a chain of custody procedure at the start of each sampling, if this is requested by the client.</p><p class="depth0">i. Maintain a close check of all aspects of the sampling operation on a regular basis.</p><p class="depth0">j. Continue sampling until at least the minimum volume is collected, as specified in the following Table I:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.009</p><p class="depth0">k. At the conclusion of sampling, turn the cassette upward before stopping the flow to minimize possible particle loss. If the sampling is resumed, restart the flow before reorienting the cassette downward. Note the condition of the filter at the conclusion of sampling.</p><p class="depth0">l. Double check to see that all information has been recorded on the data collection forms and that the cassette is securely closed and appropriately identified using a waterproof label. Protect cassettes in individual clean resealed polyethylene bags. Bags are to be used for storing cassette caps when they are removed for sampling purposes. Caps and plugs should only be removed or replaced using clean hands or clean disposable plastic gloves.</p><p class="depth0">m. Do not change containers if portions of these filters are taken for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">6. Minimum sample number per site. A minimum of 13 samples are to be collected for each testing consisting of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. A minimum of five samples per abatement area.</p><p class="depth0">b. A minimum of five samples per ambient area positioned at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site.</p><p class="depth0">c. Two field blanks are to be taken by removing the cap for not more than 30 sec and replacing it at the time of sampling before sampling is initiated at the following places:</p><p class="depth0">i. Near the entrance to each ambient area.</p><p class="depth0">ii. At one of the ambient sites.</p><p class="depth0">(Note: Do not leave the blank open during the sampling period.)</p><p class="depth0">d. A sealed blank is to be carried with each sample set. This representative cassette is not to be opened in the field.</p><p class="depth0">7. Abatement area sampling.</p><p class="depth0">a. Conduct final clearance sampling only after the primary containment barriers have been removed; the abatement area has been thoroughly dried; and, it has passed visual inspection tests by qualified personnel. (See Reference 1 of Unit III.L.)</p><p class="depth0">b. Containment barriers over windows, doors, and air passageways must remain in place until the TEM clearance sampling and analysis is completed and results meet clearance test criteria. The final plastic barrier remains in place for the sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">c. Select sampling sites in the abatement area on a random basis to provide unbiased and representative samples.</p><p class="depth0">d. After the area has passed a thorough visual inspection, use aggressive sampling conditions to dislodge any remaining dust.</p><p class="depth0">i. Equipment used in aggressive sampling such as a leaf blower and/or fan should be properly cleaned and decontaminated before use.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Air filtration units shall remain on during the air monitoring period.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Prior to air monitoring, floors, ceiling and walls shall be swept with the exhaust of a minimum one (1) horsepower leaf blower.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Stationary fans are placed in locations which will not interfere with air monitoring equipment. Fan air is directed toward the ceiling. One fan shall be used for each 10,000 ft\3\ of worksite.</p><p class="depth0">v. Monitoring of an abatement work area with high-volume pumps and the use of circulating fans will require electrical power. Electrical outlets in the abatement area may be used if available. If no such outlets are available, the equipment must be supplied with electricity by the use of extension cords and strip plug units. All electrical power supply equipment of this type must be approved Underwriter Laboratory equipment that has not been modified. All wiring must be grounded. Ground fault interrupters should be used. Extreme care must be taken to clean up any residual water and ensure that electrical equipment does not become wet while operational.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Low volume pumps may be carefully wrapped in 6-mil polyethylene to insulate the pump from the air. High volume pumps cannot be sealed in this manner since the heat of the motor may melt the plastic. The pump exhausts should be kept free.</p><p class="depth0">vii. If recleaning is necessary, removal of this equipment from the work area must be handled with care. It is not possible to completely decontaminate the pump motor and parts since these areas cannot be wetted. To minimize any problems in this area, all equipment such as fans and pumps should be carefully wet wiped prior to removal from the abatement area. Wrapping and sealing low volume pumps in 6-mil polyethylene will provide easier decontamination of this equipment. Use of clean water and disposable wipes should be available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0">e. Pump flow rate equal to or greater than 1 L/min or less than 10 L/min may be used for 25 mm cassettes. The larger cassette diameters may have comparably increased flow.</p><p class="depth0">f. Sample a volume of air sufficient to ensure the minimum quantitation limits. (See Table I of Unit III.B.5.j.)</p><p class="depth0">8. Ambient sampling.</p><p class="depth0">a. Position ambient samplers at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site. If makeup air entering the abatement site is drawn from another area of the building which is outside of the abatement area, place the pumps in the building, pumps should be placed out of doors located near the building and away from any obstructions that may influence wind patterns. If construction is in progress immediately outside the enclosure, it may be necessary to select another ambient site. Samples should be representative of any air entering the work site.</p><p class="depth0">b. Locate the ambient samplers at least 3 ft apart and protect them from adverse weather conditions.</p><p class="depth0">c. Sample same volume of air as samples taken inside the abatement site.</p><p class="depth0">C. Sample Shipment</p><p class="depth0">1. Ship bulk samples in a separate container from air samples. Bulk samples and air samples delivered to the analytical laboratory in the same container shall be rejected.</p><p class="depth0">2. Select a rigid shipping container and pack the cassettes upright in a noncontaminating nonfibrous medium such as a bubble pack. The use of resealable polyethylene bags may help to prevent jostling of individual cassettes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Avoid using expanded polystyrene because of its static charge potential. Also avoid using particle-based packaging materials because of possible contamination.</p><p class="depth0">4. Include a shipping bill and a detailed listing of samples shipped, their descriptions

and all identifying numbers or marks, sampling data, shipper's name, and contact information. For each sample set, designate which are the ambient samples, which are the abatement area samples, which are the field blanks, and which is the sealed blank if sequential analysis is to be performed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Hand-carry samples to the laboratory in an upright position if possible; otherwise choose that mode of transportation least likely to jar the samples in transit.</p><p class="depth0">6. Address the package to the laboratory sample coordinator by name when known and alert him or her of the package description, shipment mode, and anticipated arrival as part of the chain of custody and sample tracking procedures. This will also help the laboratory schedule timely analysis for the samples when they are received.</p><p class="depth0">D. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality</p><p class="depth0">Indicators)</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards is performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined, and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the text below.</p><p class="depth0">1. Prescreen the loaded cassette collection filters to assure that they do not contain concentrations of asbestos which may interfere with the analysis of the sample. A filter blank average of less than 18 s/mm\2\ in an area of 0.057 mm\2\ (nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a maximum of 53 s/mm\2\ for that same area for any single preparation is acceptable for this method.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calibrate sampling pumps and their flow indicators over the range of their intended use with a recognized standard. Assemble the sampling system with a representative filter--not the filter which will be used in sampling--before and after the sampling operation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Record all calibration information with the data to be used on a standard sampling form.</p><p class="depth0">4. Ensure that the samples are stored in a secure and representative location.</p><p class="depth0">5. Ensure that mechanical calibrations from the pump will be minimized to prevent transferral of vibration to the cassette.</p><p class="depth0">6. Ensure that a continuous smooth flow of negative pressure is delivered by the pump by installing a damping chamber if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">7. Open a loaded cassette momentarily at one of the indoor sampling sites when sampling is initiated. This sample will serve as an indoor field blank.</p><p class="depth0">8. Open a loaded cassette momentarily at one of the outdoor sampling sites when sampling is initiated. This sample will serve as an outdoor field blank.</p><p class="depth0">9. Carry a sealed blank into the field with each sample series. Do not open this cassette in the field.</p><p class="depth0">10. Perform a leak check of the sampling system at each indoor and outdoor sampling site by activating the pump with the closed sampling cassette in line. Any flow indicates a leak which must be eliminated before initiating the sampling operation.</p><p class="depth0">11. Ensure that the sampler is turned upright before interrupting the pump flow.</p><p class="depth0">12. Check that all samples are clearly labeled and that all pertinent information has been enclosed before transfer of the samples to the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sample Receiving</p><p class="depth0">1. Designate one individual as sample coordinator at the laboratory. While that individual will normally be available to receive samples, the coordinator may train and supervise others in receiving procedures for those times when he/she is not available.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adhere to the following procedures to ensure both the continued chain-of-custody and the accountability of all samples passing through the laboratory:</p><p class="depth0">a. Note the condition of the shipping package and data written on it upon receipt.</p><p class="depth0">b. Retain all bills of lading or shipping slips to document the shipper and delivery time.</p><p class="depth0">c. Examine the chain-of-custody seal, if any, and the package for its integrity.</p><p class="depth0">d. If there has been a break in the seal or substantive damage to the package, the sample coordinator shall immediately notify the shipper and a responsible laboratory manager before any action is taken to unpack the shipment.</p><p class="depth0">e. Packages with significant damage shall be accepted only by the responsible laboratory manager after discussions with the client.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unwrap the shipment in a clean, uncluttered facility. The sample coordinator or his or her designee will record the contents, including a description of each item and all identifying numbers or marks. A

Sample Receiving Form to document this information is attached for use when necessary. (See the following Figure 3.)[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.010</p><p class="depth0">Note: The person breaking the chain-of-custody seal and itemizing the contents assumes responsibility for the shipment and signs documents accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">4. Assign a laboratory number and schedule an analysis sequence.</p><p class="depth0">5. Manage all chain-of-custody samples within the laboratory such that their integrity can be ensured and documented.</p><p class="depth0">F. Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0">1. Personnel not affiliated with the Abatement Contractor shall be used to prepare samples and conduct TEM analysis. Wet-wipe the exterior of the cassettes to minimize contamination possibilities before taking them to the clean sample preparation facility.</p><p class="depth0">2. Perform sample preparation in a well-equipped clean facility.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The clean area is required to have the following minimum characteristics. The area or hood must be capable of maintaining a positive pressure with make-up air being HEPA filtered. The cumulative analytical blank concentration must average less than 18 s/mm\2\ in an area of 0.057 s/mm\2\ (nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) with no more than one single preparation to exceed 53 s/mm\2\ for that same area.</p><p class="depth0">3. Preparation areas for air samples must be separated from preparation areas for bulk samples. Personnel must not prepare air samples if they have previously been preparing bulk samples without performing appropriate personal hygiene procedures, i.e., clothing change, showering, etc.</p><p class="depth0">4. Preparation. Direct preparation techniques are required. The objective is to produce an intact carbon film containing the particulates from the filter surface which is sufficiently clear for TEM analysis. Currently recommended direct preparation procedures for polycarbonate (PC) and mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters are described in Unit III.F.7. and 8. Sample preparation is a subject requiring additional research. Variation on those steps which do not substantively change the procedure, which improve filter clearing or which reduce contamination problems in a laboratory are permitted.</p><p class="depth0">a. Use only TEM grids that have had grid opening areas measured according to directions in Unit III.J.</p><p class="depth0">b. Remove the inlet and outlet plugs prior to opening the cassette to minimize any pressure differential that may be present.</p><p class="depth0">c. Examples of techniques used to prepare polycarbonate filters are described in Unit III.F.7.</p><p class="depth0">d. Examples of techniques used to prepare mixed cellulose ester filters are described in Unit III.F.8.</p><p class="depth0">e. Prepare multiple grids for each sample.</p><p class="depth0">f. Store the three grids to be measured in appropriately labeled grid holders or polyethylene capsules.</p><p class="depth0">5. Equipment.</p><p class="depth0">a. Clean area.</p><p class="depth0">b. Tweezers. Fine-point tweezers for handling of filters and TEM grids.</p><p class="depth0">c. Scalpel Holder and Curved No. 10 Surgical Blades.</p><p class="depth0">d. Microscope slides.</p><p class="depth0">e. Double-coated adhesive tape.</p><p class="depth0">f. Gummed page reinforcements.</p><p class="depth0">g. Micro-pipet with disposal tips 10 to 100 [micro]L variable volume.</p><p class="depth0">h. Vacuum coating unit with facilities for evaporation of carbon. Use of a liquid nitrogen cold trap above the diffusion pump will minimize the possibility of contamination of the filter surface by oil from the pumping system. The vacuum-coating unit can also be used for deposition of a thin film of gold.</p><p class="depth0">i. Carbon rod electrodes. Spectrochemically pure carbon rods are required for use in the vacuum evaporator for carbon coating of filters.</p><p class="depth0">j. Carbon rod sharpener. This is used to sharpen carbon rods to a neck. The use of necked carbon rods (or equivalent) allows the carbon to be applied to the filters with a minimum of heating.</p><p class="depth0">k. Low-temperature plasma asher. This is used to etch the surface of collapsed mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters. The asher should be supplied with oxygen, and should be modified as necessary to provide a throttle or bleed valve to control the speed of the vacuum to minimize disturbance of the filter. Some early models of ashers admit air too rapidly, which may disturb particulates on the surface of the filter during the etching step.</p><p class="depth0">l. Glass petri dishes, 10 cm in diameter, 1 cm high. For prevention of excessive evaporation of solvent when these are in use, a good seal must be provided between the base and the lid. The seal can be improved by grinding the base and lid together with an abrasive grinding material.</p><p class="depth0">m. Stainless steel mesh.</p><p class="depth0">n. Lens tissue.</p><p class="depth0">o. Copper 200-mesh TEM grids, 3 mm in diameter, or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">p. Gold 200-mesh TEM grids, 3 mm in diameter, or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">q. Condensation washer.</p><p class="depth0">r. Carbon-coated, 200-mesh TEM grids, or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">s. Analytical balance, 0.1 mg sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0">t. Filter paper, 9 cm in diameter.</p><p class="depth0">u. Oven or slide warmer. Must be capable of maintaining a temperature of 65-70 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">v. Polyurethane foam, 6 mm thickness.</p><p class="depth0">w. Gold wire for evaporation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reagents.</p><p class="depth0">a. General. A supply of ultra-clean, fiber-free water must be available for washing of all components used in the analysis. Water

that has been distilled in glass or filtered or deionized water is satisfactory for this purpose. Reagents must be fiber-free.</p><p class="depth0">b. Polycarbonate preparation method--chloroform.</p><p class="depth0">c. Mixed Cellulose Ester (MCE) preparation method--acetone or the Burdette procedure (Ref. 7 of Unit III.L.).</p><p class="depth0">7. TEM specimen preparation from polycarbonate filters.</p><p class="depth0">a. Specimen preparation laboratory. It is most important to ensure that contamination of TEM specimens by extraneous asbestos fibers is minimized during preparation.</p><p class="depth0">b. Cleaning of sample cassettes. Upon receipt at the analytical laboratory and before they are taken into the clean facility or laminar flow hood, the sample cassettes must be cleaned of any contamination adhering to the outside surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">c. Preparation of the carbon evaporator. If the polycarbonate filter has already been carbon-coated prior to receipt, the carbon coating step will be omitted, unless the analyst believes the carbon film is too thin. If there is a need to apply more carbon, the filter will be treated in the same way as an uncoated filter. Carbon coating must be performed with a high-vacuum coating unit. Units that are based on evaporation of carbon filaments in a vacuum generated only by an oil rotary pump have not been evaluated for this application, and must not be used. The carbon rods should be sharpened by a carbon rod sharpener to necks of about 4 mm long and 1 mm in diameter. The rods are installed in the evaporator in such a manner that the points are approximately 10 to 12 cm from the surface of a microscope slide held in the rotating and tilting device.</p><p class="depth0">d. Selection of filter area for carbon coating. Before preparation of the filters, a 75 mmx50 mm microscope slide is washed and dried. This slide is used to support strips of filter during the carbon evaporation. Two parallel strips of double-sided adhesive tape are applied along the length of the slide. Polycarbonate filters are easily stretched during handling, and cutting of areas for further preparation must be performed with great care. The filter and the MCE backing filter are removed together from the cassette and placed on a cleaned glass microscope slide. The filter can be cut with a curved scalpel blade by rocking the blade from the point placed in contact with the filter. The process can be repeated to cut a strip approximately 3 mm wide across the diameter of the filter. The strip of polycarbonate filter is separated from the corresponding strip of backing filter and carefully placed so that it bridges the gap between the adhesive tape strips on the microscope slide. The filter strip can be held with fine-point tweezers and supported underneath by the scalpel blade during placement on the microscope slide. The analyst can place several such strips on the same microscope slide, taking care to rinse and wet-wipe the scalpel blade and tweezers before handling a new sample. The filter strips should be identified by etching the glass slide or marking the slide using a marker insoluble in water and solvents. After the filter strip has been cut from each filter, the residual parts of the filter must be returned to the cassette and held in position by reassembly of the cassette. The cassette will then be archived for a period of 30 days or returned to the client upon request.</p><p class="depth0">e. Carbon coating of filter strips. The glass slide holding the filter strips is placed on the rotation-tilting device, and the evaporator chamber is evacuated. The evaporation must be performed in very short bursts, separated by some seconds to allow the electrodes to cool. If evaporation is too rapid, the strips of polycarbonate filter will begin to curl, which will lead to cross-linking of the surface material and make it relatively insoluble in chloroform. An experienced analyst can judge the thickness of carbon film to be applied, and some test should be made first on unused filters. If the film is too thin, large particles will be lost from the TEM specimen, and there will be few complete and undamaged grid openings on the specimen. If the coating is too thick, the filter will tend to curl when exposed to chloroform vapor and the carbon film may not adhere to the support mesh. Too thick a carbon film will also lead to a TEM image that is lacking in contrast, and the ability to obtain ED patterns will be compromised. The carbon film should be as thin as possible and remain intact on most of the grid openings of the TEM specimen intact.</p><p class="depth0">f. Preparation of the Jaffe washer. The precise design of the Jaffe washer is not considered important, so any one of the published designs may be used. A washer consisting of a simple stainless steel bridge is recommended. Several pieces of lens tissue approximately 1.0 cmx0.5 cm are placed on the stainless steel bridge, and the washer is filled with chloroform to a level where the meniscus contacts the underside of the mesh, which results in saturation of the lens tissue. See References 8 and 10 of Unit III.L.</p><p class="depth0">g. Placing of specimens into the Jaffe washer. The TEM grids are first placed on a piece of lens tissue so that individual grids can be picked up with tweezers. Using a curved scalpel blade, the analyst excises three 3 mm square pieces of the carbon-coated polycarbonate filter from the filter strip. The three squares are selected from the center of the strip and from two points between the outer periphery of the active surface and the center. The piece of filter is placed on a TEM specimen grid with the shiny side of the TEM grid facing upwards, and the whole assembly is placed boldly onto the saturated lens tissue in the Jaffe washer. If carbon-coated grids are used, the filter should be

placed carbon-coated side down. The three excised squares of filters are placed on the same piece of lens tissue. Any number of separate pieces of lens tissue may be placed in the same Jaffe washer. The lid is then placed on the Jaffe washer, and the system is allowed to stand for several hours, preferably overnight.</p><p class="depth0">h. Condensation washing. It has been found that many polycarbonate filters will not dissolve completely in the Jaffe washer, even after being exposed to chloroform for as long as 3 days. This problem becomes more serious if the surface of the filter was overheated during the carbon evaporation. The presence of undissolved filter medium on the TEM preparation leads to partial or complete obscuration of areas of the sample, and fibers that may be present in these areas of the specimen will be overlooked; this will lead to a low result. Undissolved filter medium also compromises the ability to obtain ED patterns. Before they are counted, TEM grids must be examined critically to determine whether they are adequately cleared of residual filter medium. It has been found that condensation washing of the grids after the initial Jaffe washer treatment, with chloroform as the solvent, clears all residual filter medium in a period of approximately 1 hour. In practice, the piece of lens tissue supporting the specimen grids is transferred to the cold finger of the condensation washer, and the washer is operated for about 1 hour. If the specimens are cleared satisfactorily by the Jaffe washer alone, the condensation washer step may be unnecessary.</p><p class="depth0">8. TEM specimen preparation from MCE filters.</p><p class="depth0">a. This method of preparing TEM specimens from MCE filters is similar to that specified in NIOSH Method 7402. See References 7, 8, and 9 of Unit III.L.</p><p class="depth0">b. Upon receipt at the analytical laboratory, the sample cassettes must be cleaned of any contamination adhering to the outside surfaces before entering the clean sample preparation area.</p><p class="depth0">c. Remove a section from any quadrant of the sample and blank filters.</p><p class="depth0">d. Place the section on a clean microscope slide. Affix the filter section to the slide with a gummed paged reinforcement or other suitable means. Label the slide with a water and solvent-proof marking pen.</p><p class="depth0">e. Place the slide in a petri dish which contains several paper filters soaked with 2 to 3 mL acetone. Cover the dish. Wait 2 to 4 minutes for the sample filter to fuse and clear.</p><p class="depth0">f. Plasma etching of the collapsed filter is required.</p><p class="depth0">i. The microscope slide to which the collapsed filter pieces are attached is placed in a plasma asher. Because plasma ashers vary greatly in their performance, both from unit to unit and between different positions in the asher chamber, it is difficult to specify the conditions that should be used. This is one area of the method that requires further evaluation. Insufficient etching will result in a failure to expose embedded filters, and too much etching may result in loss of particulate from the surface. As an interim measure, it is recommended that the time for ashing of a known weight of a collapsed filter be established and that the etching rate be calculated in terms of micrometers per second. The actual etching time used for a particular asher and operating conditions will then be set such that a 1-2 [micro]m (10 percent) layer of collapsed surface will be removed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Place the slide containing the collapsed filters into a low-temperature plasma asher, and etch the filter.</p><p class="depth0">g. Transfer the slide to a rotating stage inside the bell jar of a vacuum evaporator. Evaporate a 1 mmx5 mm section of graphite rod onto the cleared filter. Remove the slide to a clean, dry, covered petri dish.</p><p class="depth0">h. Prepare a second petri dish as a Jaffe washer with the wicking substrate prepared from filter or lens paper placed on top of a 6 mm thick disk of clean spongy polyurethane foam. Cut a V-notch on the edge of the foam and filter paper. Use the V-notch as a reservoir for adding solvent. The wicking substrate should be thin enough to fit into the petri dish without touching the lid.</p><p class="depth0">i. Place carbon-coated TEM grids face up on the filter or lens paper. Label the grids by marking with a pencil on the filter paper or by putting registration marks on the petri dish lid and marking with a waterproof marker on the dish lid. In a fume hood, fill the dish with acetone until the wicking substrate is saturated. The level of acetone should be just high enough to saturate the filter paper without creating puddles.</p><p class="depth0">j. Remove about a quarter section of the carbon-coated filter samples from the glass slides using a surgical knife and tweezers. Carefully place the section of the filter, carbon side down, on the appropriately labeled grid in the acetone-saturated petri dish. When all filter sections have been transferred, slowly add more solvent to the wedge-shaped trough to bring the acetone level up to the highest possible level without disturbing the sample preparations. Cover the petri dish. Elevate one side of the petri dish by placing a slide under it. This allows drops of condensed solvent vapors to form near the edge rather than in the center where they would drip onto the grid preparation.</p><p class="depth0">G. TEM Method</p><p class="depth0">1. Instrumentation.</p><p class="depth0">a. Use an 80-120 kV TEM capable of performing electron diffraction with a fluorescent screen inscribed with calibrated gradations. If the TEM is equipped with EDXA it must either have a STEM attachment or be capable of producing a spot less than 250 nm

in diameter at crossover. The microscope shall be calibrated routinely (see Unit III.J.) for magnification and camera constant.</p><p class="depth0">b. While not required on every microscope in the laboratory, the laboratory must have either one microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis or access to an equivalent system on a TEM in another laboratory. This must be an Energy Dispersive X-ray Detector mounted on TEM column and associated hardware/software to collect, save, and read out spectral information. Calibration of Multi-Channel Analyzer shall be checked regularly for A1 at 1.48 KeV and Cu at 8.04 KeV, as well as the manufacturer's procedures.</p><p class="depth0">i. Standard replica grating may be used to determine magnification (e.g., 2160 lines/mm).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Gold standard may be used to determine camera constant.</p><p class="depth0">c. Use a specimen holder with single tilt and/or double tilt capabilities.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">a. Start a new Count Sheet for each sample to be analyzed. Record on count sheet: analyst's initials and date; lab sample number; client sample number microscope identification; magnification for analysis; number of predetermined grid openings to be analyzed; and grid identification. See the following Figure 4:

Microscope settings: 80-120 kV, grid assessment 250-1000X, then 15,000-20,000X screen magnification for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">d. Approximately one-half (0.5) of the predetermined sample area to be analyzed shall be performed on one sample grid preparation and the remaining half on a second sample grid preparation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Determine the suitability of the grid.</p><p class="depth0">i. Individual grid openings with greater than 5 percent openings (holes) or covered with greater than 25 percent particulate matter or obviously having nonuniform loading shall not be analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examine the grid at low magnification (<1000X) to determine its suitability for detailed study at higher magnifications.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Reject the grid if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Less than 50 percent of the grid openings covered by the replica are intact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is doubled or folded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It is too dark because of incomplete dissolution of the filter.</p><p class="depth0">iv. If the grid is rejected, load the next sample grid.</p><p class="depth0">v. If the grid is acceptable, continue on to Step 6 if mapping is to be used; otherwise proceed to Step 7.</p><p class="depth0">f. Grid Map (Optional).</p><p class="depth0">i. Set the TEM to the low magnification mode.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Use flat edge or finder grids for mapping.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Index the grid openings (fields) to be counted by marking the acceptable fields for one-half (0.5) of the area needed for analysis on each of the two grids to be analyzed. These may be marked just before examining each grid opening (field), if desired.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Draw in any details which will allow the grid to be properly oriented if it is reloaded into the microscope and a particular field is to be reliably identified.</p><p class="depth0">g. Scan the grid.</p><p class="depth0">i. Select a field to start the examination.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Choose the appropriate magnification (15,000 to 20,000X screen magnification).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Scan the grid as follows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At the selected magnification, make a series of parallel traverses across the field. On reaching the end of one traverse, move the image one window and reverse the traverse.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A slight overlap should be used so as not to miss any part of the grid opening (field).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Make parallel traverses until the entire grid opening (field) has been scanned.</p><p class="depth0">h. Identify each structure for appearance and size.</p><p class="depth0">i. Appearance and size: Any continuous grouping of particles in which an asbestos fiber within aspect ratio greater than or equal to 5:1 and a length greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m is detected shall be recorded on the count sheet. These will be designated asbestos structures and will be classified as fibers, bundles, clusters, or matrices. Record as individual fibers any contiguous grouping having 0, 1, or 2 definable intersections. Groupings having more than 2 intersections are to be described as cluster or matrix. See the following Figure 5:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.012



[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.013
An intersection is a non-parallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio of 5:1 or greater. Combinations such as a matrix and cluster, matrix and bundle, or bundle and cluster are categorized by the dominant fiber quality--cluster, bundle, and matrix, respectively. Separate categories will be maintained for fibers less than 5 [micro]m and for fibers greater than or equal to 5 [micro]m in length. Not required, but useful, may be to record the fiber length in 1 [micro]m intervals. (Identify each structure morphologically and analyze it as it enters the ``window''.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fiber. A structure having a minimum length greater than 0.5 [micro]m and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed, no intersections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bundle. A structure composed of 3 or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cluster. A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group; groupings must have more than 2 intersections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Matrix. Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> NSD. Record NSD when no structures are detected in the field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Intersection. Non-parallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio 5:1 or greater.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Structure Measurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recognize the structure that is to be sized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Memorize its location in the ``window'' relative to the sides, inscribed square and to other particulates in the field so this exact location can be found again when scanning is resumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Measure the structure using the scale on the screen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Record the length category and structure type classification on the count sheet after the field number and fiber number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Return the fiber to its original location in the window and scan the rest of the field for other fibers; if the direction of travel is not remembered, return to the right side of the field and begin the traverse again.</p><p class="depth0">i. Visual identification of Electron Diffraction (ED) patterns is required for each asbestos structure counted which would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration. (Generally this means the first four fibers identified as asbestos must exhibit an identifiable diffraction pattern for chrysotile or amphibole.)</p><p class="depth0">i. Center the structure, focus, and obtain an ED pattern. (See Microscope Instruction Manual for more detailed instructions.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. From a visual examination of the ED pattern, obtained with a short camera length, classify the observed structure as belonging to one of the following classifications: chrysotile, amphibole, or nonasbestos.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Chrysotile: The chrysotile asbestos pattern has characteristic streaks on the layer lines other than the central line and some streaking also on the central line. There will be spots of normal sharpness on the central layer line and on alternate lines (2nd, 4th, etc.). The repeat distance between layer lines is 0.53 nm and the center doublet is at 0.73 nm. The pattern should display (002), (110), (130) diffraction maxima; distances and geometry should match a chrysotile pattern and be measured semiquantitatively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amphibole Group [includes grunerite (amosite), crocidolite, anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite]: Amphibole asbestos fiber patterns show layer lines formed by very closely spaced dots, and the repeat distance between layer lines is also about 0.53 nm. Streaking in layer lines is occasionally present due to crystal structure defects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nonasbestos: Incomplete or unobtainable ED patterns, a nonasbestos EDXA, or a nonasbestos morphology.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The micrograph number of the recorded diffraction patterns must be reported to the client and maintained in the laboratory's quality assurance records. The records must also demonstrate that the identification of the pattern has been verified by a qualified individual and that the operator who made the identification is maintaining at least an 80 percent correct visual identification based on his measured patterns. In the event that examination of the pattern by the qualified individual indicates that the pattern had been misidentified visually, the client shall be contacted. If the pattern is a suspected chrysotile, take a photograph of the diffraction pattern at 0 degrees tilt. If the structure is suspected to be amphibole, the sample may have to be tilted to obtain a simple geometric array of spots.</p><p class="depth0">j. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDXA).</p><p class="depth0">i. Required of all amphiboles which would cause the analysis results to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration. (Generally speaking, the first 4 amphiboles would require EDXA.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Can be used alone to confirm chrysotile after the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration has been exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Can be used alone to confirm all nonasbestos.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Compare spectrum profiles with profiles obtained from asbestos standards. The closest match identifies and categorizes the structure.</p><p class="depth0">v. If the EDXA is used for confirmation, record the properly labeled spectrum on a computer disk, or if a hard copy, file with analysis data.</p><p class="depth0">vi. If the number of fibers in the nonasbestos class would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm\2\ concentration, their identities must be confirmed by EDXA or measurement of a zone axis diffraction pattern to establish that the particles are nonasbestos.</p><p class="depth0">k. Stopping Rules.</p><p class="depth0">i. If more than 50 asbestiform structures are counted in a particular grid opening, the analysis may be terminated.</p><p class="depth0">ii. After having counted 50 asbestiform structures in a minimum of 4 grid openings, the analysis may be terminated. The grid opening in which the 50th fiber was counted must be completed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. For blank samples, the analysis is always continued until 10 grid openings have been analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In all other samples the analysis shall be continued until an analytical sensitivity of 0.005 s/cm\3\ is reached.</p><p class="depth0">l. Recording Rules. The count sheet should contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0">i. Field (grid opening): List field number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Record ``NSD'' if no structures are detected.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Structure information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If fibers, bundles, clusters, and/or matrices are found, list them in consecutive numerical order, starting over with each field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Length. Record length category of asbestos fibers examined. Indicate if less than 5 [micro]m or greater than or equal to 5 [micro]m.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Structure Type. Positive identification of asbestos fibers is required by the method. At least one diffraction pattern of each fiber type from every five samples must be recorded and compared with a standard diffraction pattern. For each asbestos fiber reported, both a morphological descriptor and an identification descriptor shall be specified on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fibers classified as chrysotile must be identified by diffraction and/or X-ray analysis and recorded on the count sheet. X-ray analysis alone can be used as sole identification only after 70s/mm\2\ have been exceeded for a particular sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fibers classified as amphiboles must be identified by X-ray analysis and electron diffraction and recorded on the count sheet. (X-ray analysis alone can be used as sole identification only after 70s/mm\2\ have been exceeded for a particular sample.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If a diffraction pattern was recorded on film, the micrograph number must be indicated on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If an electron diffraction was attempted and an appropriate spectra is not observed, N should be recorded on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If an X-ray analysis is attempted but not observed, N should be recorded on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If an X-ray analysis spectrum is stored, the file and disk number must be recorded on the count sheet.</p><p class="depth0">m. Classification Rules.</p><p class="depth0">i. Fiber. A structure having a minimum length greater than or equal to 0.5 [micro]m and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides.

The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.</p><p class="depth0">v. NSD. Record NSD when no structures are detected in the field.</p><p class="depth0">n. After all necessary analyses of a particle structure have been completed, return the goniometer stage to 0 degrees, and return the structure to its original location by recall of the original location.</p><p class="depth0">o. Continue scanning until all the structures are identified, classified and sized in the field.</p><p class="depth0">p. Select additional fields (grid openings) at low magnification; scan at a chosen magnification (15,000 to 20,000X screen magnification); and analyze until the stopping rule becomes applicable.</p><p class="depth0">q. Carefully record all data as they are being collected, and check for accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">r. After finishing with a grid, remove it from the microscope, and replace it in the appropriate grid hold. Sample grids must be stored for a minimum of 1 year from the date of the analysis; the sample cassette must be retained for a minimum of 30 days by the laboratory or returned at the client's request.</p><p class="depth0">H. Sample Analytical Sequence</p><p class="depth0">1. Carry out visual inspection of work site prior to air monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">2. Collect a minimum of five air samples inside the work site and five samples outside the work site. The indoor and outdoor samples shall be taken during the same time period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Analyze the abatement area samples according to this protocol. The analysis must meet the 0.005 s/cm\3\ analytical sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0">4. Remaining steps in the analytical sequence are contained in Unit IV. of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">I. Reporting</p><p class="depth0">The following information must be reported to the client. See the following Table II:

Signature of laboratory official to indicate that the laboratory met specifications of the AHERA method.</p><p class="depth0">10. Report form must contain official laboratory identification (e.g., letterhead).</p><p class="depth0">11. Type of asbestos.</p><p class="depth0">J. Calibration Methodology</p><p class="depth0">Note: Appropriate implementation of the method requires a person knowledgeable in electron diffraction and mineral identification by ED and EDXA. Those inexperienced laboratories wishing to develop capabilities may acquire necessary knowledge through analysis of appropriate standards and by following detailed methods as described in References 8 and 10 of Unit III.L.</p><p class="depth0">1. Equipment Calibration. In this method, calibration is required for the air-sampling equipment and the transmission electron microscope (TEM).</p><p class="depth0">a. TEM Magnification. The magnification at the fluorescent screen of the TEM must be calibrated at the grid opening magnification (if used) and also at the magnification used for fiber counting. This is performed with a cross grating replica. A logbook must be maintained, and the dates of calibration depend on the past history of the particular microscope; no frequency is specified. After any maintenance of the microscope that involved adjustment of the power supplied to the lenses or the high-voltage system or the mechanical disassembly of the electron optical column apart from filament exchange, the magnification must be recalibrated. Before the TEM calibration is performed, the analyst must ensure that the cross grating replica is placed at the same distance from the objective lens as the specimens are. For instruments that incorporate an eucentric tilting specimen stage, all speciments and the cross grating replica must be placed at the eucentric position.</p><p class="depth0">b. Determination of the TEM magnification on the fluorescent screen.</p><p class="depth0">i. Define a field of view on the fluorescent screen either by markings or physical boundaries. The field of view must be measurable or previously inscribed with a scale or concentric circles (all scales should be metric).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Insert a diffraction grating replica (for example a grating containing 2,160 lines/mm) into the specimen holder and place into the microscope. Orient the replica so that the grating lines fall perpendicular to the scale on the TEM fluorescent screen. Ensure that the goniometer stage tilt is 0 degrees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Adjust microscope magnification to 10,000X or 20,000X. Measure the distance (mm) between two widely separated lines on the grating replica. Note the number of spaces between the lines. Take care to measure between the same relative positions on the lines (e.g., between left edges of lines).</p><p class="depth0">Note: The more spaces included in the measurement, the more accurate the final calculation. On most microscopes, however, the magnification is substantially constant only within the central 8-10 cm diameter region of the fluorescent screen.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Calculate the true magnification (M) on the fluorescent screen:
M=XG/Y
where:
X=total distance (mm) between the designated grating lines;G=calibration constant of the grating replica (lines/mm):Y=number of grating replica spaces counted along X.</p><p class="depth0">c. Calibration of the EDXA System. Initially, the EDXA system must be calibrated by using two reference elements to calibrate the energy scale of the instrument. When this has been completed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, calibration in terms of the different types of asbestos can proceed. The EDXA detectors vary in both solid angle of detection and in window thickness. Therefore, at a particular accelerating voltage in use on the TEM, the count rate obtained from specific dimensions of fiber will vary both in absolute X-ray count rate and in the relative X-ray peak heights for different elements. Only a few minerals are relevant for asbestos abatement work, and in this procedure the calibration is specified in terms of a ``fingerprint'' technique. The EDXA spectra must be recorded from individual fibers of the relevant minerals, and identifications are made on the basis of semiquantitative comparisons with these reference spectra.</p><p class="depth0">d. Calibration of Grid Openings.</p><p class="depth0">i. Measure 20 grid openings on each of 20 random 200-mesh copper grids by placing a grid on a glass slide and examining it under the PCM. Use a calibrated graticule to measure the average field diameter and use this number to calculate the field area for an average grid opening. Grids are to be randomly selected from batches up to 1,000.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A grid opening is considered as one field.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The mean grid opening area must be measured for the type of specimen grids in use. This can be accomplished on the TEM at a properly calibrated low magnification or on an optical microscope at a magnification of approximately 400X by using an eyepiece fitted with a scale that has been calibrated against a stage micrometer. Optical microscopy utilizing manual or automated procedures may be used providing instrument calibration can be verified.</p><p class="depth0">e. Determination of Camera Constant and ED Pattern Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">i. The camera length of the TEM in ED operating mode must be calibrated before ED patterns on unknown samples are observed. This can be achieved by using a carbon-coated grid on which a thin film of gold has been

sputtered or evaporated. A thin film of gold is evaporated on the specimen TEM grid to obtain zone-axis ED patterns superimposed with a ring pattern from the polycrystalline gold film.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In practice, it is desirable to optimize the thickness of the gold film so that only one or two sharp rings are obtained on the superimposed ED pattern. Thicker gold film would normally give multiple gold rings, but it will tend to mask weaker diffraction spots from the unknown fibrous particulates. Since the unknown d-spacings of most interest in asbestos analysis are those which lie closest to the transmitted beam, multiple gold rings are unnecessary on zone-axis ED patterns. An average camera constant using multiple gold rings can be determined. The camera constant is one-half the diameter, D, of the rings times the interplanar spacing, d, of the ring being measured.</p><p class="depth0">K. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality</p><p class="depth0">Indicators)</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards is performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the following Table III:

IV. Mandatory Interpretation of Transmission Electron Microscopy Results</p><p class="depth0">To Determine Completion of Response Actions</p><p class="depth0">A. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">A response action is determined to be completed by TEM when the abatement area has been cleaned and the airborne asbestos concentration inside the abatement area is no higher than concentrations at locations outside the abatement area. ``Outside'' means outside the abatement area, but not necessarily outside the building. EPA reasons that an asbestos removal contractor cannot be expected to clean an abatement area to an airborne asbestos concentration that is lower than the concentration of air entering the abatement area from outdoors or from other parts of the building. After the abatement area has passed a thorough visual inspection, and before the outer containment barrier is removed, a minimum of five air samples inside the abatement area and a minimum of five air samples outside the abatement area must be collected. Hence, the response action is determined to be completed when the average airborne asbestos concentration measured inside the abatement area is not statistically different from the average airborne asbestos concentration measured outside the abatement area.</p><p class="depth0">The inside and outside concentrations are compared by the Z-test, a statistical test that takes into account the variability in the measurement process. A minimum of five samples inside the abatement area and five samples outside the abatement area are required to control the false negative error rate, i.e., the probability of declaring the removal complete when, in fact, the air concentration inside the abatement area is significantly higher than outside the abatement area. Additional quality control is provided by requiring three blanks (filters through which no air has been drawn) to be analyzed to check for unusually high filter contamination that would distort the test results.</p><p class="depth0">When volumes greater than or equal to 1,199 L for a 25 mm filter and 2,799 L for a 37 mm filter have been collected and the average number of asbestos structures on samples inside the abatement area is no greater than 70 s/mm \2\ of filter, the response action

may be considered complete without comparing the inside samples to the outside samples. EPA is permitting this initial screening test to save analysis costs in situations where the airborne asbestos concentration is sufficiently low so that it cannot be distinguished from the filter contamination/background level (fibers deposited on the filter that are unrelated to the air being sampled). The screening test cannot be used when volumes of less than 1,199 L for 25 mm filter or 2,799 L for a 37 mm filter are collected because the ability to distinguish levels significantly different from filter background is reduced at low volumes.</p><p class="depth0">The initial screening test is expressed in structures per square millimeter of filter because filter background levels come from sources other than the air being sampled and cannot be meaningfully expressed as a concentration per cubic centimeter of air. The value of 70 s/mm \2\ is based on the experience of the panel of microscopists who consider one structure in 10 grid openings (each grid opening with an area of 0.0057 mm \2\) to be comparable with contamination/background levels of blank filters. The decision is based, in part, on Poisson statistics which indicate that four structures must be counted on a filter before the fiber count is statistically distinguishable from the count for one structure. As more information on the performance of the method is collected, this criterion may be modified. Since different combinations of the number and size of grid openings are permitted under the TEM protocol, the criterion is expressed in structures per square millimeter of filter to be consistent across all combinations. Four structures per 10 grid openings corresponds to approximately 70 s/mm\2\.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sample Collection and Analysis</p><p class="depth0">1. A minimum of 13 samples is required: five samples collected inside the abatement area, five samples collected outside the abatement area, two field blanks, and one sealed blank.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sampling and TEM analysis must be done according to either the mandatory or nonmandatory protocols in Appendix A. At least 0.057 mm\2\ of filter must be examined on blank filters.</p><p class="depth0">C. Interpretation of Results</p><p class="depth0">1. The response action shall be considered complete if either:</p><p class="depth0">a. Each sample collected inside the abatement area consists of at least 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter, or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter, and the arithmetic mean of their asbestos structure concentrations per square millimeter of filter is less than or equal to 70 s/mm \2\; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The three blank samples have an arithmetic mean of the asbestos structure concentration on the blank filters that is less than or equal to 70 s/mm \2\ and the average airborne asbestos concentration measured inside the abatement area is not statistically higher than the average airborne asbestos concentration measured outside the abatement area as determined by the Z-test. The Z-test is carried out by calculating[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.016
where YI is the average of the natural logarithms of the inside samples and YO is the average of the natural logarithms of the outside samples, nI is the number of inside samples and nO is the number of outside samples. The response action is considered complete if Z is less than or equal to 1.65.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When no fibers are counted, the calculated detection limit for that analysis is inserted for the concentration.</p><p class="depth0">2. If the abatement site does not satisfy either (1) or (2) of this Section C, the site must be recleaned and a new set of samples collected.</p><p class="depth0">D. Sequence for Analyzing Samples</p><p class="depth0">It is possible to determine completion of the response action without analyzing all samples. Also, at any point in the process, a decision may be made to terminate the analysis of existing samples, reclean the abatement site, and collect a new set of samples. The following sequence is outlined to minimize the number of analyses needed to reach a decision.</p><p class="depth0">1. Analyze the inside samples.</p><p class="depth0">2. If at least 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter is collected for each inside sample and the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter of filter is less than or equal to 70 s/mm \2\, the response action is complete and no further analysis is needed.</p><p class="depth0">3. If less than 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter is collected for any of the inside samples, or the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter of filter is greater than 70 s/mm \2\, analyze the three blanks.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter on the blank filters is greater than 70 s/mm \2\, terminate the analysis, identify and correct the source of blank contamination, and collect a new set of samples.</p><p class="depth0">5. If the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter on the blank filters is less than or equal to 70 s/mm\2\, analyze the outside samples and perform the Z-test.</p><p class="depth0">6. If the Z-statistic is less than or equal to 1.65, the response action is complete. If the Z-statistic is greater than 1.65, reclean the abatement site and collect a new set of samples.

Definitions</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of Appendix C:</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)'' means any material containing more than one percent asbestos which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a building, which when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable asbestos-containing material after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.</p><p class="depth0">2. ``Friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM)'' means any friable ACM that is in or on interior structural members or other parts of a school or public and commercial building.</p><p class="depth0">3. ``Inspection'' means an activity undertaken in a school building, or a public and commercial building, to determine the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM) or suspected ACBM, whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. This term includes reinspections of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified. The term does not include the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b) solely for the purpose of recording or reporting a change in the condition of known or assumed ACBM;</p><p class="depth0">b. Inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State, or local government solely for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable statutes or regulations; or</p><p class="depth0">c. visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) solely for the purpose of determining completion of response actions.</p><p class="depth0">4. ``Major fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM.</p><p class="depth0">5. ``Minor fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear feet or less of friable ACBM.</p><p class="depth0">6. ``Public and commercial building'' means the interior space of any building which is not a school building, except that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units or detached single-family homes. The term includes, but is not limited to: industrial and office buildings, residential apartment buildings and condominiums of 10 or more dwelling units, government-owned buildings, colleges, museums, airports, hospitals, churches, preschools, stores, warehouses and factories. Interior space includes exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems used to condition interior space.</p><p class="depth0">7. ``Response action'' means a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure, repair, and operation and maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM.</p><p class="depth0">8. ``Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">a. Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes.</p><p class="depth0">b. Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings.</p><p class="depth0">c. Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve.</p><p class="depth0">d. Installation or removal of a small section of drywall.</p><p class="depth0">e. Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials.</p><p class="depth0">SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations:</p><p class="depth0">f. Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended as asbestos abatement.</p><p class="depth0">g. Removal of asbestos-containing thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single glove bag.</p><p class="depth0">h. Minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal.</p><p class="depth0">i. Repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing wallboard.</p><p class="depth0">j. Repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only if required in the performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement. Such work may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure. Such an enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended containment function.</p><p class="depth0">B. Initial Training</p><p class="depth0">Training requirements for purposes of accreditation are specified both in terms of required subjects of instruction and in terms of length of training. Each initial training course has a prescribed curriculum and number of days of training. One day of training equals 8 hours, including breaks and lunch. Course instruction must be provided by EPA or State-approved instructors. EPA or State instructor approval shall be based upon a review of the instructor's academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.</p><p class="depth0">Beyond the initial training requirements, individual States may wish to consider requiring additional days of training for purposes of supplementing hands-on activities or for reviewing relevant state regulations. States also may wish to consider the relative merits of a worker apprenticeship program. Further, they might consider more stringent minimum qualification standards for the approval of training instructors. EPA recommends that the enrollment in any given course be limited to 25 students so that adequate opportunities exist for individual hands-on experience.</p><p class="depth0">States have the option to provide initial training directly or approve other entities to offer training. The following requirements are for the initial training of persons required to have accreditation under TSCA Title II.</p><p class="depth0">Training requirements for each of the five accredited disciplines are outlined below. Persons in each discipline perform a different job function and distinct role. Inspectors identify and assess the condition of ACBM, or suspect ACBM. Management planners use data gathered by inspectors to assess the degree of hazard posed by ACBM in schools to determine the scope and timing of appropriate response actions needed for schools. Project designers determine how asbestos abatement work should be conducted. Lastly, workers and contractor/supervisors carry out and oversee abatement work. In addition, a recommended training curriculum is also presented for a sixth discipline, which is not federally-accredited, that of ``Project Monitor.'' Each accredited discipline and training curriculum is separate and distinct from the others. A person seeking accreditation in any of the five accredited MAP disciplines cannot attend two or more courses concurrently, but may attend such courses sequentially.</p><p class="depth0">In several instances, initial training courses for a specific discipline (e.g., workers, inspectors) require hands-on training. For asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors and workers, hands-on training should include working with asbestos-substitute materials, fitting and using respirators, use of glovebags, donning protective clothing, and constructing a decontamination unit as well as other abatement work activities.</p><p class="depth0">1. Workers</p><p class="depth0">A person must be accredited as a worker to carry out any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement workers shall complete at least a 4-day training course as outlined below. The 4-day worker training course shall include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and an examination. Hands-on training must permit workers to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement. A person who is otherwise accredited as a contractor/supervisor may perform in the role of a worker without possessing separate accreditation as a worker.</p><p class="depth0">Because of cultural diversity associated with the asbestos workforce, EPA recommends that States adopt specific standards for the approval of foreign language courses for abatement workers. EPA further recommends the use of audio-visual materials to complement lectures, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">The training course shall adequately address the following topics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Physical characteristics of asbestos.

This workshop could consist of a series of two or three videos with different site conditions and different degrees of cleanliness.</p><p class="depth0">C. Examinations</p><p class="depth0">1. Each State shall administer a closed book examination or designate other entities such as State-approved providers of training courses to administer the closed-book examination to persons seeking accreditation who have completed an initial training course. Demonstration testing may also be included as part of the examination. A person seeking initial accreditation in a specific discipline must pass the examination for that discipline in order to receive accreditation. For example, a person seeking accreditation as an abatement project designer must pass the State's examination for abatement project designer.</p><p class="depth0">States may develop their own examinations, have providers of training courses develop examinations, or use standardized examinations developed for purposes of accreditation under TSCA Title II. In addition, States may supplement standardized examinations with questions about State regulations. States may obtain commercially developed standardized examinations, develop standardized examinations independently, or do so in cooperation with other States, or with commercial or non-profit providers on a regional or national basis. EPA recommends the use of standardized, scientifically-validated testing instruments, which may be beneficial in terms of both promoting competency and in fostering accreditation reciprocity between States.</p><p class="depth0">Each examination shall adequately cover the topics included in the training course for that discipline. Each person who completes a

training course, passes the required examination, and fulfills whatever other requirements the State imposes must receive an accreditation certificate in a specific discipline. Whether a State directly issues accreditation certificates, or authorizes training providers to issue accreditation certificates, each certificate issued to an accredited person must contain the following minimum information:</p><p class="depth0">a. A unique certificate number</p><p class="depth0">b. Name of accredited person</p><p class="depth0">c. Discipline of the training course completed.</p><p class="depth0">d.

The name, address, and telephone number of the training provider that issued the certificate.</p><p class="depth0">h. A statement that the person receiving the certificate has completed the requisite training for asbestos accreditation under TSCA Title II.</p><p class="depth0">States or training providers who reaccredit persons based upon completion of required refresher training must also provide accreditation certificates with all of the above information, except the examination date may be omitted if a State does not require a refresher examination for reaccreditation.</p><p class="depth0">Where a State licenses accredited persons but has authorized training providers to issue accreditation certificates, the State may issue licenses in the form of photo-identification cards. Where this applies, EPA recommends that the State licenses should include all of the same information required for the accreditation certificates. A State may also choose to issue photo-identification cards in addition to the required accreditation certificates.</p><p class="depth0">Accredited persons must have their initial and current accreditation certificates at the location where they are conducting work.</p><p class="depth0">2. The following are the requirements for examination in each discipline:</p><p class="depth0">a. Worker:</p><p class="depth0">i. 50 multiple-choice questions</p><p class="depth0">ii.

Continuing Education</p><p class="depth0">For all disciplines, a State's accreditation program shall include annual refresher training as a requirement for reaccreditation as indicated below:</p><p class="depth0">1. Workers: One full day of refresher training.</p><p class="depth0">2. Contractor/Supervisors: One full day of refresher training.</p><p class="depth0">3. Inspectors: One half-day of refresher training.</p><p class="depth0">4. Management Planners: One half-day of inspector refresher training and one half-day of refresher training for management planners.</p><p class="depth0">5. Project Designers: One full day of refresher training.</p><p class="depth0">The refresher courses shall be specific to each discipline. Refresher courses shall be conducted as separate and distinct courses and not combined with any other training during the period of the refresher course. For each discipline, the refresher course shall review and discuss changes in Federal, State, and local regulations, developments in state-of-the-art procedures, and a review of key aspects of the initial training course as determined by the State. After completing the annual refresher course, persons shall have their accreditation extended for an additional year from the date of the refresher course. A State may consider requiring persons to pass reaccreditation examinations at specific intervals (for example, every 3 years).</p><p class="depth0">EPA recommends that States formally establish a 12-month grace period to enable formerly accredited persons with expired certificates to complete refresher training and have their accreditation status reinstated without having to re-take the initial training course.</p><p class="depth0">E. Qualifications</p><p class="depth0">In addition to requiring training and an examination, a State may require candidates for accreditation to meet other qualification and/or experience standards that the State considers appropriate for some or all disciplines. States may choose to consider requiring qualifications similar to the examples outlined below for inspectors, management planners and project designers. States may modify these examples as appropriate. In addition, States may want to include some requirements based on experience in performing a task directly as a part of a job or in an apprenticeship role. They may also wish to consider additional criteria for the approval of training course instructors beyond those prescribed by EPA.</p><p class="depth0">1. Inspectors: Qualifications - possess a high school diploma. States may want to require an Associate's Degree in specific fields (e.g., environmental or physical sciences).</p><p class="depth0">2. Management Planners: Qualifications - Registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist or related scientific field.</p><p class="depth0">3. Project Designers: Qualifications - registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist.</p><p class="depth0">4. Asbestos Training Course Instructor: Qualifications - academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.</p><p class="depth0">EPA recommends that States prescribe minimum qualification standards for training instructors employed by training providers.</p><p class="depth0">F. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers</p><p class="depth0">All approved providers of accredited asbestos training courses must comply with the following minimum recordkeeping requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Training course materials. A training provider must retain copies of all instructional materials used in the delivery of the classroom training such as student manuals, instructor notebooks and handouts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Instructor qualifications. A training provider must retain copies of all instructors' resumes, and the documents approving each instructor issued by either EPA or a State. Instructors must be approved by either EPA or a State before teaching courses for accreditation purposes. A training provider must notify EPA or the State, as appropriate, in advance whenever it changes course instructors. Records must accurately identify the instructors that taught each particular course for each date that a course is offered.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examinations. A training provider must document that each person who receives an accreditation certificate for an initial training course has achieved a passing score on the examination. These records must clearly indicate the date upon which the exam was administered, the training course and discipline for which the exam was given, the name of the person who proctored the exam, a copy of the exam, and the name and test score of each person taking the exam. The topic and dates of the training course must correspond to those listed on that person's accreditation certificate. States may choose to apply these same requirements to examinations for refresher training courses.</p><p class="depth0">4. Accreditation certificates. The training providers or States, whichever issues the accreditation certificate, shall maintain records that document the names of all persons who have been awarded certificates, their certificate numbers, the disciplines for which accreditation was conferred, training and expiration dates, and the training location. The training provider or State shall maintain the records in a manner that allows verification by telephone of the required information.</p><p class="depth0">5. Verification of certificate information. EPA recommends that training providers of refresher training courses confirm that their students possess valid accreditation before granting course admission. EPA further recommends that training providers offering the initial management planner training course verify that students have met the prerequisite of possessing valid inspector accreditation at the time of course admission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The training provider shall maintain all required records for a minimum of 3 years. The training provider, however, may find it advantageous to retain these records for a longer period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The training provider must allow reasonable access to all of the records required by the MAP, and to any other records which may be required by States for the approval of asbestos training providers or the accreditation of asbestos training courses, to both EPA and to State Agencies, on request. EPA encourages training providers to make this information equally accessible to the general public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a training provider ceases to conduct training, the training provider shall notify the approving government body (EPA or the State) and give it the opportunity to take possession of that providers asbestos training records.</p><p class="depth0">G. Deaccreditation</p><p class="depth0">1. States must establish criteria and procedures for deaccrediting persons accredited as workers, contractor/supervisors, inspectors, management planners, and project designers. States must follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing deaccreditation actions. At a minimum, the criteria shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Performing work requiring accreditation at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current accreditation certificates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Permitting the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Obtaining accreditation from a training provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP.</p><p class="depth0">EPA may directly pursue deaccreditation actions without reliance on State deaccreditation or enforcement authority or actions. In addition to the above-listed situations, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the accreditation of persons who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or convicted under section 16 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2615 or 2647, for violations of 40 CFR part 763, or section 113 of the Clean

Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, for violations of 40 CFR part 61, subpart M.</p><p class="depth0">2. Any person who performs asbestos work requiring accreditation under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), without such accreditation is in violation of TSCA. The following persons are not accredited for purposes of section 206(a) of TSCA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any person who obtains training documentation through fraudulent means;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any person who gains admission to and completes refresher training through fraudulent representation of initial or previous refresher training documentation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such as education, training, professional registration, or experience.</p><p class="depth0">H. Reciprocity</p><p class="depth0">EPA recommends that each State establish reciprocal arrangements with other States that have established accreditation programs that meet or exceed the requirements of the MAP. Such arrangements might address cooperation in licensing determinations, the review and approval of training programs and/or instructors, candidate testing and exam administration, curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, and the exchange of information and data. The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative activity and the attainment of a more professional accredited workforce as States are able to refine and improve the effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States.</p><p class="depth0">I. Electronic Reporting</p><p class="depth0">States that choose to receive electronic documents must include, at a minimum, the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3--(Electronic reporting) in their programs.</p><p class="depth0">II. EPA Approval Process for State Accreditation Programs</p><p class="depth0">A. States may seek approval for a single discipline or all disciplines as specified in the MAP. For example, a State that currently only requires worker accreditation may receive EPA approval for that discipline alone. EPA encourages States that currently do not have accreditation requirements for all disciplines required under section 206(b)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2), to seek EPA approval for those disciplines the State does accredit. As States establish accreditation requirements for the remaining disciplines, the requested information outlined below should be submitted to EPA as soon as possible. Any State that had an accreditation program approved by EPA under an earlier version of the MAP may follow the same procedures to obtain EPA approval of their accreditation program under this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">B. Partial approval of a State Program for the accreditation of one or more disciplines does not mean that the State is in full compliance with TSCA where the deadline for that State to have adopted a State Plan no less stringent than the MAP has already passed. State Programs which are at least as stringent as the MAP for one or more of the accredited disciplines may, however, accredit persons in those disciplines only.</p><p class="depth0">C. States seeking EPA approval or reapproval of accreditation programs shall submit the following information to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator at their EPA Regional office:</p><p class="depth0">1. A copy of the legislation establishing or upgrading the State's accreditation program (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">2. A copy of the State's accreditation regulations or revised regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. A letter to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator that clearly indicates how the State meets the program requirements of this MAP.

one or more disciplines. Any training courses approved by an EPA-approved State Program are considered to be EPA-approved for purposes of accreditation.</p><p class="depth0">III. Approval of Training Courses</p><p class="depth0">Individuals or groups wishing to sponsor training courses for disciplines required to be accredited under section 206(b)(1)(A) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A), may apply for approval from States that have accreditation program requirements that are at least as stringent as this MAP. For a course to receive approval, it must meet the requirements for the course as outlined in this MAP, and any other requirements imposed by the State from which approval is being sought. Courses that have been approved by a State with an accreditation program at least as stringent as this MAP are approved under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), for that particular State, and also for any other State that does not have an accreditation program as stringent as this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">A. Initial Training Course Approval</p><p class="depth0">A training provider must submit the following minimum information to a State as part of its application for the approval of each training course:</p><p class="depth0">1. The course provider's name, address, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth0">2. A list of any other States that currently approve the training course.</p><p class="depth0">3.

A description of and an example of the numbered certificates issued to students who complete the refresher course and pass the examination, if required.</p><p class="depth0">C. Withdrawal of Training Course Approval</p><p class="depth0">States must establish criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval from accredited training programs. States should follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing actions for suspension or withdrawal of approval of training programs. At a minimum, the criteria shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's approval by a State or EPA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to maintain requisite records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other accreditation information; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA MAP or State Accreditation Program, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the criteria listed above, EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval where an approved training course instructor, or other person with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found in violation of other asbestos regulations administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation, or execution of a consent agreement and order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant statutes or regulations. States may wish to adopt this criterion modified to include their own asbestos statutes or regulations. EPA may also suspend or withdraw approval of training programs where a training provider has submitted false information as a part of the self-certification required under Unit V.B. of the revised MAP.</p><p class="depth0">Training course providers shall permit representatives of EPA or the State which approved their training courses to attend, evaluate, and monitor any training course without charge. EPA or State compliance inspection staff are not required to give advance notice of their inspections. EPA may suspend or withdraw State or EPA approval of a training course based upon the criteria specified in this Unit III.C.</p><p class="depth0">IV. EPA Procedures for Suspension or Revocation of Accreditation or</p><p class="depth0">Training Course Approval.</p><p class="depth0">A. If the Administrator decides to suspend or revoke the accreditation of any person or suspend or withdraw the approval of a training course, the Administrator will notify the affected entity of the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. The grounds upon which the suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is based.</p><p class="depth0">2.

If such suspension, revocation, or withdrawal notice has not previously been issued, it will be issued at the same time the emergency suspension notice is issued.</p><p class="depth0">E. Any notice, decision, or order issued by the Administrator under this section, and any documents filed by an accredited person or approved training course provider in a hearing under this section, shall be available to the public except as otherwise provided by section 14 of TSCA or by 40 CFR part 2. Any such hearing at which oral testimony is presented shall be open to the public, except that the Presiding Officer may exclude the public to the extent necessary to allow presentation of information which may be entitled to confidential treatment under section 14 of TSCA or 40 CFR part 2.</p><p class="depth0">V. Implementation Schedule</p><p class="depth0">The various requirements of this MAP become effective in accordance with the following schedules:</p><p class="depth0">A. Requirements applicable to State Programs</p><p class="depth0">1. Each State shall adopt an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as this MAP within 180 days after the commencement of the first regular session of the legislature of the State that is convened on or after April 4, 1994.</p><p class="depth0">2. If a State has adopted an accreditation plan at least as stringent as this MAP as of April 4, 1994, the State may continue to:</p><p class="depth0">a. Conduct TSCA training pursuant to this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">b. Approve training course providers to conduct training and to issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">c. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">3. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but has not adopted an accreditation plan at least as stringent as this MAP by April 4, 1994, may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Conduct TSCA training which remains in compliance with the requirements of Unit V.B. of this MAP. After such training has been self-certified in accordance with Unit V.B. of this MAP, the State may issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">b. Sustain its approval for any training course providers to conduct training and issue TSCA accreditation that the State had approved before April 4, 1994, and that remain in compliance with Unit V.B. of this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">c. Issue accreditation pursuant to an earlier version of the MAP that provisionally

satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation until October 4, 1994.</p><p class="depth0">Such a State may not approve new TSCA training course providers to conduct training or to issue TSCA accreditation that satisfies the requirements of this MAP until the State adopts an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">4. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but fails to adopt a plan as stringent as this MAP by the deadline established in Unit V.A.1., is subject to the following after that deadline date:</p><p class="depth0">a. The State loses any status it may have held as an EPA-approved State for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.</p><p class="depth0">b. All training course providers approved by the State lose State approval to conduct training and issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.</p><p class="depth0">c. The State may not:</p><p class="depth0">i. Conduct training for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Approve training course providers to conduct training or issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation.</p><p class="depth0">EPA will extend EPA-approval to any training course provider that loses State approval because the State does not comply with the deadline, so long as the provider is in compliance with Unit V.B. of this MAP, and the provider is approved by a State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP as of the day before the State loses its EPA approval.</p><p class="depth0">5. A State that does not have an accreditation program that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under either an earlier version of the MAP or this MAP, may not:</p><p class="depth0">a. Conduct training for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646;</p><p class="depth0">b. Approve training course providers to conduct training or issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation.</p><p class="depth0">B. Requirements applicable to Training Courses and Providers</p><p class="depth0">As of October 4, 1994, an approved training provider must certify to EPA and to any State that has approved the provider for TSCA accreditation, that each of the provider's training courses complies with the requirements of this MAP. The written submission must document in specific detail the changes made to each training course in order to comply with the requirements of this MAP and clearly state that the provider is also in compliance with all other requirements of this MAP, including the new recordkeeping and certificate provisions. Each submission must include the following statement signed by an authorized representative of the training provider: ``Under civil and criminal penalties of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable requirements of Title II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements.'' A consolidated self-certification submission from each training provider that addresses all of its approved training courses is permissible and encouraged.</p><p class="depth0">The self-certification must be sent via registered mail, to EPA Headquarters at the following address: Attn. Self-Certification Program, Field Programs Branch, Chemical Management Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. A duplicate copy of the complete submission must also be sent to any States from which approval had been obtained.</p><p class="depth0">The timely receipt of a complete self-certification by EPA and all approving States shall have the effect of extending approval under this MAP to the training courses offered by the submitting provider. If a self-certification is not received by the approving government bodies on or before the due date, the affected training course is not approved under this MAP. Such training providers must then reapply for approval of these training courses pursuant to the procedures outlined in Unit III.</p><p class="depth0">C. Requirements applicable to Accredited Persons.</p><p class="depth0">Persons accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994, are accredited in accordance with the requirements of this MAP, and are not required to retake initial training. They must continue to comply with the requirements for annual refresher training in Unit I.D. of the revised MAP.</p><p class="depth0">D. Requirements applicable to Non-Accredited Persons.</p><p class="depth0">In order to perform work requiring accreditation under TSCA Title II, persons who are not accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994,

must comply with the upgraded training requirements of this MAP by no later than October 4, 1994. Non-accredited persons may obtain initial accreditation on a provisional basis by successfully completing any of the training programs approved under an earlier version of the MAP, and thereby perform work during the first 6 months after this MAP takes effect. However, by October 4, 1994, these persons must have successfully completed an upgraded training program that fully complies with the requirements of this MAP in order to continue to perform work requiring accreditation under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.

Appendix D to Subpart E of Part 763--Transport and Disposal of</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos Waste</p><p class="depth0">For the purposes of this appendix, transport is defined as all activities from receipt of the containerized asbestos waste at the generation site until it has been unloaded at the disposal site. Current EPA regulations state that there must be no visible emissions to the outside air during waste transport. However, recognizing the potential hazards and subsequent liabilities associated with exposure, the following additional precautions are recommended.</p><p class="depth0">Recordkeeping. Before accepting wastes, a transporter should determine if the waste is properly wetted and containerized. The transporter should then require a chain-of-custody form signed by the generator. A chain-of-custody form may include the name and address of the generator, the name and address of the pickup site, the estimated quantity of asbestos waste, types of containers used, and the destination of the waste. The chain-of-custody form should then be signed over to a disposal site operator to transfer responsibility for the asbestos waste. A copy of the form signed by the disposal site operator should be maintained by the transporter as evidence of receipt at the disposal site.</p><p class="depth0">Waste handling. A transporter should ensure that the asbestos waste is properly contained in leak-tight containers with appropriate labels, and that the outside surfaces of the containers are not contaminated with asbestos debris adhering to the containers. If there is reason to believe that the condition of the asbestos waste may allow significant fiber release, the transporter should not accept the waste. Improper containerization of wastes is a violation of the NESHAPs regulation and should be reported to the appropriate EPA Regional Asbestos NESHAPs contact below:</p><p class="depth0">Region I</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Office of Environmental Stewardship, USEPA, Region I, 5 Post Office Square--Suite 100, Boston, MA 02109-3912, (617) 918-1551.</p><p class="depth0">Region II</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air & Waste Management Division, USEPA, Region II, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10007, (212) 264-6770.</p><p class="depth0">Region III</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air Management Division, USEPA, Region III, 841 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, (215) 597-9325.</p><p class="depth0">Region IV</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air, Pesticide & Toxic Management, USEPA, Region IV, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, GA 30365, (404) 347-4298.</p><p class="depth0">Region V</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air Management Division, USEPA, Region V, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, IL 60604, (312) 353-6793.</p><p class="depth0">Region VI</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air & Waste Management Division, USEPA, Region VI, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, TX 75202, (214) 655-7229.</p><p class="depth0">Region VII</p><p class="depth0">Asbestos NESHAPs Contact, Air and Waste Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 7, 11201 Renner Boulevard, Lenexa, Kansas 66219.

Similarly, at the disposal site, the asbestos waste containers should be transferred carefully to avoid fiber release.</p><p class="depth0">Waste transport. Although there are no regulatory specifications regarding the transport vehicle, it is recommended that vehicles used for transport of containerized asbestos waste have an enclosed carrying compartment or utilize a canvas covering sufficient to contain the transported waste, prevent damage to containers, and prevent fiber release. Transport of large quantities of asbestos waste is commonly conducted in a 20-cubic-yard ``roll off'' box, which should also be covered. Vehicles that use compactors to reduce waste volume should not be used because these will cause the waste containers to rupture. Vacuum trucks used to transport waste slurry must be inspected to ensure that water is not leaking from the truck.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal involves the isolation of asbestos waste material in order to prevent fiber release to air or water. Landfilling is recommended as an environmentally sound isolation method because asbestos fibers are virtually immobile in soil. Other disposal techniques such as incineration or chemical treatment are not feasible due to the unique properties of asbestos. EPA has established asbestos disposal requirements for active and inactive disposal sites under NESHAPs (40 CFR Part 61, subpart M) and specifies general requirements for solid waste disposal under RCRA (40 CFR Part 257). Advance EPA notification of the intended disposal site is required by NESHAPs.</p><p class="depth0">Selecting a disposal facility. An acceptable disposal facility for asbestos wastes must adhere to EPA's requirements of no visible emissions to the air during disposal, or minimizing emissions by covering the waste within 24 hours. The minimum required cover is 6 inches of nonasbestos material, normally soil, or a dust-suppressing chemical. In addition to these Federal requirements, many state or local government agencies require more stringent handling procedures. These agencies usually supply a list of ``approved'' or licensed asbestos disposal sites upon request. Solid waste control agencies are listed in local telephone directories under state, county, or city headings. A list of state solid waste agencies may be obtained by calling the RCRA hotline: 1-800-424-9346 (382-3000 in Washington, DC). Some landfill owners or operators place special requirements on asbestos waste, such as placing all bagged waste into 55-gallon metal drums. Therefore, asbestos removal contractors should contact the intended landfill before arriving with the waste.</p><p class="depth0">Receiving asbestos waste. A landfill approved for receipt of asbestos waste should require notification by the waste hauler that the load contains asbestos. The landfill operator should inspect the loads to verify that asbestos waste is properly contained in leak-tight containers and labeled appropriately. The appropriate EPA Regional Asbestos NESHAPs Contact should be notified if the landfill operator believes that the asbestos waste is in a condition that may cause significant fiber release during disposal. In situations when the wastes are not properly containerized, the landfill operator should thoroughly soak the asbestos with a water spray prior to unloading, rinse out the truck, and immediately cover the wastes with nonasbestos material prior to compacting the waste in the landfill.</p><p class="depth0">Waste deposition and covering. Recognizing the health dangers associated with asbestos exposure, the following procedures are recommended to augment current federal requirements:</p><p class="depth0">Designate a separate area for asbestos waste disposal. Provide a record for future landowners that asbestos waste has been buried there and that it would be hazardous to attempt to excavate that area. (Future regulations may require property deeds to identify the location of any asbestos wastes and warn against excavation.)</p><p class="depth0">Prepare a separate trench to receive asbestos wastes. The size of the trench will depend upon the quantity and frequency of asbestos waste delivered to the disposal site. The trenching technique allows application of soil cover without disturbing the asbestos waste containers. The trench should be ramped to allow the transport vehicle to back into it, and the trench should be as narrow as possible to reduce the amount of cover required. If possible, the trench should be aligned perpendicular to prevailing winds.</p><p class="depth0">Place the asbestos waste containers into the trench carefully to avoid breaking them. Be particularly careful with plastic bags because when they break under pressure asbestos particles can be emitted.</p><p class="depth0">Completely cover the containerized waste within 24 hours with a minimum of 6 inches of nonasbestos material. Improperly containerized waste is a violation of the NESHAPs and EPA should be notified.</p><p class="depth0">However, if improperly containerized waste is received at the disposal site, it should be covered immediately after unloading. Only after the wastes, including properly containerized wastes, are completely covered, can the wastes be compacted or other heavy equipment run over it. During compacting, avoid exposing wastes to the air or tracking asbestos material away from the trench.</p><p class="depth0">For final closure of an area containing asbestos waste, cover with at least an additional 30 inches of compacted nonasbestos material to provide a 36-inch final cover. To control erosion of the final cover, it should be properly graded and vegetated. In areas of the United States where excessive soil erosion may occur or the frost line exceeds 3 feet, additional final cover is recommended.

In desert areas where vegetation would be difficult to maintain, 3-6 inches of well graded crushed rock is recommended for placement on top of the final cover.</p><p class="depth0">Controlling public access. Under the current NESHAPs regulation, EPA does not require that a landfill used for asbestos disposal use warning signs or fencing if it meets the requirement to cover asbestos wastes. However, under RCRA, EPA requires that access be controlled to prevent exposure of the public to potential health and safety hazards at the disposal site. Therefore, for liability protection of operators of landfills that handle asbestos, fencing and warning signs are recommended to control public access when natural barriers do not exist. Access to a landfill should be limited to one or two entrances with gates that can be locked when left unattended. Fencing should be installed around the perimeter of the disposal site in a manner adequate to deter access by the general public. Chain-link fencing, 6-ft high and topped with a barbed wire guard, should be used. More specific fencing requirements may be specified by local regulations. Warning signs should be displayed at all entrances and at intervals of 330 feet or less along the property line of the landfill or perimeter of the sections where asbestos waste is deposited.

Polarized Light Microscopy</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Principle and Applicability</p><p class="depth0">Bulk samples of building materials taken for asbestos identification are first examined for homogeneity and preliminary fiber identification at low magnification. Positive identification of suspect fibers is made by analysis of subsamples with the polarized light microscope.</p><p class="depth0">The principles of optical mineralogy are well established. \1 2\ A light microscope equipped with two polarizing filters is used to observe specific optical characteristics of a sample. The use of plane polarized light allows the determination of refractive indices along specific crystallographic axes. Morphology and color are also observed. A retardation plate is placed in the polarized light path for determination of the sign of elongation using orthoscopic illumination. Orientation of the two filters such that their vibration planes are perpendicular (crossed polars) allows observation of the birefringence and extinction characteristics of anisotropic particles.</p><p class="depth0">Quantitative analysis involves the use of point counting. Point counting is a standard technique in petrography for determining the relative areas occupied by separate minerals in thin sections of rock. Background information on the use of point counting \2\ and the interpretation of point count data \3\ is available.</p><p class="depth0">This method is applicable to all bulk samples of friable insulation materials submitted for identification and quantitation of asbestos components.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Range</p><p class="depth0">The point counting method may be used for analysis of samples containing from 0 to 100 percent asbestos. The upper detection limit is 100 percent. The lower detection limit is less than 1 percent.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">Fibrous organic and inorganic constituents of bulk samples may interfere with the identification and quantitation of the asbestos mineral content. Spray-on binder materials may coat fibers and affect color or obscure optical characteristics to the extent of masking fiber identity. Fine particles of other materials may also adhere to fibers to an extent sufficient to cause confusion in identification. Procedures that may be used for the removal of interferences are presented in Section 1.7.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Precision and Accuracy</p><p class="depth0">Adequate data for measuring the accuracy and precision of the method for samples with various matrices are not currently available.

Bulk samples submitted for analysis are usually friable and may release fibers during handling or matrix reduction steps. All sample and slide preparations should be carried out in a ventilated hood or glove box with continuous airflow (negative pressure). Handling of samples without these precautions may result in exposure of the analyst and contamination of samples by airborne fibers.</p><p class="depth0">1.7.1 Sampling</p><p class="depth0">Samples for analysis of asbestos content shall be taken in the manner prescribed in Reference 5 and information on design of sampling and analysis programs may be found in Reference 6. If there are any questions about the representative nature of the sample, another sample should be requested before proceeding with the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1.7.2 Analysis</p><p class="depth0">1.7.2.1 Gross Examination</p><p class="depth0">Bulk samples of building materials taken for the identification and quantitation of asbestos are first examined for homogeneity at low magnification with the aid of a stereomicroscope. The core sample may be examined in its container or carefully removed from the container onto a glassine transfer paper or clean glass plate. If possible, note is made of the top and bottom orientation. When discrete strata are identified, each is treated as a separate material so that fibers are first identified and quantified in that layer only, and then the results for each layer are combined to yield an estimate of asbestos content for the whole sample.</p><p class="depth0">1.7.2.2 Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0">Bulk materials submitted for asbestos analysis involve a wide variety of matrix materials. Representative subsamples may not be readily obtainable by simple means in heterogeneous materials, and various steps may be required to alleviate the difficulties encountered. In most cases, however, the best preparation is made by using forceps to sample at several places from the bulk material. Forcep samples are immersed in a refractive index liquid on a microscope slide, teased apart, covered with a cover glass, and observed with the polarized light microscope.</p><p class="depth0">Alternatively, attempts may be made to homogenize the sample or eliminate interferences before further characterization. The selection of appropriate procedures is dependent upon the samples encountered and personal preference. The following are presented as possible sample preparation steps.</p><p class="depth0">A mortar and pestle can sometimes be used in the size reduction of soft or loosely bound

materials though this may cause matting of some samples. Such samples may be reduced in a Wylie mill. Apparatus should be clean and extreme care exercised to avoid cross-contamination of samples. Periodic checks of the particle sizes should be made during the grinding operation so as to preserve any fiber bundles present in an identifiable form. These procedures are not recommended for samples that contain amphibole minerals or vermiculite. Grinding of amphiboles may result in the separation of fiber bundles or the production of cleavage fragments with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Grinding of vermiculite may also produce fragments with aspect ratios greater than 3:1.</p><p class="depth0">Acid treatment may occasionally be required to eliminate interferences. Calcium carbonate, gypsum, and bassanite (plaster) are frequently present in sprayed or trowelled insulations. These materials may be removed by treatment with warm dilute acetic acid. Warm dilute hydrochloric acid may also be used to remove the above materials. If acid treatment is required, wash the sample at least twice with distilled water, being careful not to lose the particulates during decanting steps. Centrifugation or filtration of the suspension will prevent significant fiber loss. The pore size of the filter should be 0.45 micron or less. Caution: prolonged acid contact with the sample may alter the optical characteristics of chrysotile fibers and should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">Coatings and binding materials adhering to fiber surfaces may also be removed by treatment with sodium metaphosphate.\7\ Add 10 mL of 10g/L sodium metaphosphate solution to a small (0.1 to 0.5 mL) sample of bulk material in a 15-mL glass centrifuge tube. For approximately 15 seconds each, stir the mixture on a vortex mixer, place in an ultrasonic bath and then shake by hand. Repeat the series. Collect the dispersed solids by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. Wash the sample three times by suspending in 10 mL distilled water and recentrifuging. After washing, resuspend the pellet in 5 mL distilled water, place a drop of the suspension on a microscope slide, and dry the slide at 110 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">In samples with a large portion of cellulosic or other organic fibers, it may be useful to ash part of the sample and view the residue. Ashing should be performed in a low temperature asher. Ashing may also be performed in a muffle furnace at temperatures of 500 [deg]C or lower. Temperatures of 550 [deg]C or higher will cause dehydroxylation of the asbestos minerals, resulting in changes of the refractive index and other key parameters. If a muffle furnace is to be used, the furnace thermostat should be checked and calibrated to ensure that samples will not be heated at temperatures greater than 550 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">Ashing and acid treatment of samples should not be used as standard procedures. In order to monitor possible changes in fiber characteristics, the material should be viewed microscopically before and after any sample preparation procedure. Use of these procedures on samples to be used for quantitation requires a correction for percent weight loss.</p><p class="depth0">1.7.2.3 Fiber Identification</p><p class="depth0">Positive identification of asbestos requires the determination of the following optical properties.</p><p class="depth0">Morphology</p><p class="depth0">Color and pleochroism</p><p class="depth0">Refractive indices</p><p class="depth0">Birefringence</p><p class="depth0">Extinction characteristics</p><p class="depth0">Sign of elongation
Table 1-1 lists the above properties for commercial asbestos fibers. Figure 1-1 presents a flow diagram of the examination procedure. Natural variations in the conditions under which deposits of asbestiform minerals are formed will occasionally produce exceptions to the published values and differences from the UICC standards. The sign of elongation is determined by use of the compensator plate and crossed polars. Refractive indices may be determined by the Becke line test. Alternatively, dispersion staining may be used. Inexperienced operators may find that the dispersion staining technique is more easily learned, and should consult Reference 9 for guidance. Central stop dispersion staining colors are presented in Table 1-2. Available high-dispersion (HD) liquids should be used.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1-1--Optical Properties of Asbestoc Fibers----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Refractive indices \b\</p><p class="depth0">Mineral           Morphology, color ----------------------------  Birefring-   Extinction      Sign of</p><p class="depth0">\a\           [alpha]       [gamma]         ence                     elonation----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chrysotile (asbestiform  Wavy fibers.

An ocular reticle (cross-hair or point array) is used to visually superimpose a point or points on the microscope field of view. Record the number of points positioned directly above each kind of particle or fiber of interest. Score only points directly over asbestos fibers or nonasbestos matrix material. Do not score empty points for the closest particle. If an asbestos fiber and a matrix particle overlap so that a point is superimposed on their visual intersection, a point is scored for both categories. Point counting provides a determination of the area percent asbestos. Reliable conversion of area percent to percent of dry weight is not currently feasible unless the specific gravities and relative volumes of the materials are known.</p><p class="depth0">For the purpose of this method, ``asbestos fibers'' are defined as having an aspect ratio greater than 3:1 and being positively identified as one of the minerals in Table 1-1.</p><p class="depth0">A total of 400 points superimposed on either asbestos fibers or nonasbestos matrix material must be counted over at least eight different preparations of representative subsamples. Take eight forcep samples and mount each separately with the appropriate refractive index liquid. The preparation should not be heavily loaded. The sample should be uniformly dispersed to avoid overlapping particles and allow 25-50 percent empty area within the fields of view.

For samples with mixtures of isotropic and anisotropic materials present, viewing the sample with slightly uncrossed polars or the addition of the compensator plate to the polarized light path will allow simultaneous discrimination of both particle types. Quantitation should be performed at 100X or at the lowest magnification of the polarized light microscope that can effectively distinguish the sample components. Confirmation of the quantitation result by a second analyst on some percentage of analyzed samples should be used as standard quality control procedure.</p><p class="depth0">The percent asbestos is calculated as follows:% asbestos = (a/n) 100%

For naturally occurring materials the commonly associated asbestos-related mineral interferences can usually be anticipated. However, for fabricated materials the nature of the interferences may vary greatly (Table 2-3) and present more serious problems in identification and quantitation.\10\ Potential interferences are summarized in Table 2-4 and include the following:</p><p class="depth0">Chlorite has major peaks at 7.19 [Aring] and 3.58 [Aring] That interfere with both the primary (7.36 [Aring]) and secondary (3.66 [Aring]) peaks for chrysotile. Resolution of the primary peak to give good quantitative results may be possible when a step-scanning mode of operation is employed.</p><p class="depth0">Halloysite has a peak at 3.63 [Aring] that interferes with the secondary (3.66 [Aring]) peak for chrysotile.</p><p class="depth0">Kaolinite has a major peak at 7.15 [Aring] that may interfere with the primary peak of chrysotile at 7.36 [Aring] when present at concentrations of 10 percent. However, the secondary chrysotile peak at 3.66 [Aring] may be used for quantitation.</p><p class="depth0">Gypsum has a major peak at 7.5 [Aring] that overlaps the 7.36 [Aring] peak of chrysotile when present as a major sample constituent. This may be removed by careful washing with distilled water, or be heating to 300 [deg]C to convert gypsum to plaster of paris.</p><p class="depth0">Cellulose has a broad peak that partially overlaps the secondary (3.66 [Aring]) chrysotile peak.\8\</p><p class="depth0">Overlap of major diagnostic peaks of the amphibole asbestos minerals, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, and tremolite, at approximately 8.3 [Aring] and 3.1 [Aring] causes mutual interference when these minerals occur in the presence of one another. In some instances, adquate resolution may be attained by using step-scanning methods and/or by decreasing the collimator slit width at the X-ray port.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2-3--Common Constituents in Insulation and Wall Materials

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has a peak at 3.035 [Aring] that overlaps major amphibole peaks at approximately 3.1 [Aring] when present in concentrations of 5 percent. Removal of carbonates with a dilute acid wash is possible; however, if present, chrysotile may be partially dissolved by this treatment.\11\</p><p class="depth0">A major talc peak at 3.12 [Aring] interferes with the primary tremolite peak at this same position and with secondary peaks of crocidolite (3.10 [Aring]), amosite (3.06 [Aring]), and anthophyllite (3.05 [Aring]). In the presence of talc, the major diagnostic peak at approximately 8.3 [Aring] should be used for quantitation of these asbestiform minerals.</p><p class="depth0">The problem of intraspecies and matrix interferences is further aggravated by the variability of the silicate mineral powder diffraction patterns themselves, which often makes definitive identification of the asbestos minerals by comparison with standard reference diffraction patterns difficult. This variability results from alterations in the crystal lattice associated with differences in isomorphous substitution and degree of crystallinity. This is especially true for the amphiboles. These minerals exhibit a wide variety of very similar chemical compositions, with the result being that their diffraction patterns are chracterized by having major (110) reflections of the monoclinic amphiboles and (210) reflections of the orthorhombic anthophyllite separated by less than 0.2 [Aring]. \12\</p><p class="depth0">2.3.2 Matrix Effects</p><p class="depth0">If a copper X-ray source is used, the presence of iron at high concentrations in a sample will result in significant X-ray fluorescence, leading to loss of peak intensity along with increased background intensity and an overall decrease in sensitivity. This situation may be corrected by choosing an X-ray source other than copper; however, this is often accompanied both by loss of intensity and by decreased resolution of closely spaced reflections. Alternatively, use of a diffracted beam monochromator will reduce background fluorescent raditation, enabling weaker diffraction peaks to be detected.</p><p class="depth0">X-ray absorption by the sample matrix will result in overall attenuation of the diffracted beam and may seriously interfere with quantitative analysis. Absorption effects may be minimized by using sufficiently ``thin'' samples for analysis. \5 13 14\ However, unless absorption effects are known to be the same for both samples and standards, appropriate corrections should be made by referencing diagnostic peak areas to an internal standard \7 8\ or filter substrate (Ag) peak. \5 6\</p><p class="depth0">2.3.3 Particle Size Dependence</p><p class="depth0">Because the intensity of diffracted X-radiation is particle-size dependent, it is essential for accurate quantitative analysis that both sample and standard reference materials have similar particle size distributions. The optimum particle size range for quantitative analysis of asbestos by XRD has been reported to be 1 to 10 [micro]m.\15\ Comparability of sample and standard reference material particle size distributions should be verified by optical microscopy (or another suitable method) prior to analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.3.4 Preferred Orientation Effects</p><p class="depth0">Preferred orientation of asbestiform minerals during sample preparation often poses a serious problem in quantitative analysis by XRD. A number of techniques have been developed for reducing preferred orientation effects in ``thick layer'' samples. \7 8 15\ However, for ``thin'' samples on membrane filters, the preferred orientation effects seem to be both reproducible and favorable to enhancement of the principal diagnostic reflections of asbestos minerals, actually increasing the overall sensitivity of the method. \12 14\ (Further investigation into preferred orientation effects in both thin layer and bulk samples is required.)</p><p class="depth0">2.3.5 Lack of Suitably Characterized Standard Materials</p><p class="depth0">The problem of obtaining and characterizing suitable reference materials for asbestos analysis is clearly recognized. NIOSH has

recently directed a major research effort toward the preparation and characterization of analytical reference materials, including asbestos standards; \16 17\ however, these are not available in large quantities for routine analysis.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the problem of ensuring the comparability of standard reference and sample materials, particularly regarding crystallite size, particle size distribution, and degree of crystallinity, has yet to be adequately addressed. For example, Langer et al. \18\ have observed that in insulating matrices, chrysotile tends to break open into bundles more frequently than amphiboles. This results in a line-broadening effect with a resultant decrease in sensitivity. Unless this effect is the same for both standard and sample materials, the amount of chrysotile in the sample will be underestimated by XRD analysis. To minimize this problem, it is recommended that standardized matrix reduction procedures be used for both sample and standard materials.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Precision and Accuracy</p><p class="depth0">Precision of the method has not been determined.</p><p class="depth0">Accuracy of the method has not been determined.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Apparatus</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1 Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0">Sample preparation apparatus requirements will depend upon the sample type under consideration and the kind of XRD analysis to be performed.</p><p class="depth0">Mortar and Pestle: Agate or porcelain.</p><p class="depth0">Razor Blades</p><p class="depth0">Sample Mill: SPEX, Inc., freezer mill or equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">Bulk Sample Holders</p><p class="depth0">Silver Membrane Filters: 25-mm diameter, 0.45-[micro]m pore size.

Preparation of a homogeneous, representative sample from asbestos-containing materials is particularly difficult because the fibrous nature of the asbestos minerals inhibits mechanical mixing and stirring, and because milling procedures may cause adverse lattice alterations.</p><p class="depth0">A discussion of specific matrix reduction procedures is given below. Complete methods of sample preparation are detailed in Sections 2.7.2.2 and 2.7.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">Note: All samples should be examined microscopically before and after each matrix reduction step to monitor changes in sample particle size, composition, and crystallinity, and to ensure sample representativeness and homogeneity for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.1.1 Milling-- Mechanical milling of asbestos materials has been shown to decrease fiber crystallinity, with a resultant decrease in diffraction intensity of the specimen; the degree of lattice alteration is related to the duration and type of milling process. \19 22\ Therefore, all milling times should be kept to a minimum.</p><p class="depth0">For qualitative analysis, particle size is not usually of critical importance and initial characterization of the material with a minimum of matrix reduction is often desirable to document the composition of the sample as received. Bulk samples of very large particle size (2-3 mm) should be comminuted to 100 [micro]m. A mortar and pestle can sometimes be used in size reduction of soft or loosely bound materials though this may cause matting of some samples. Such samples may be reduced by cutting with a razor blade in a mortar, or by grinding in a suitable mill (e.g., a microhammer mill or equivalent). When using a mortar for grinding or cutting, the sample should be moistened with ethanol, or some other suitable wetting agent, to minimize exposures.</p><p class="depth0">For accurate, reproducible quantitative analysis, the particle size of both sample and standard materials should be reduced to 10 [micro]m (see Section 2.3.3). Dry ball milling at liquid nitrogen temperatures (e.g., Spex Freezer Mill, or equivalent) for a maximum time of 10 min. is recommended to obtain satisfactory particle size distributions while protecting the integrity of the crystal lattice. \5\ Bulk samples of very large particle size may require grinding in two stages for full matrix reduction to <10 [micro]m. \8 16\</p><p class="depth0">Final particle size distributions should always be verified by optical microscopy or another suitable method.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.1.2 Low temperature ashing--For materials shown by PLM to contain large amounts of gypsum, cellulosic, or other organic materials, it may be desirable to ash the samples prior to analysis to reduce background radiation or matrix interference. Since chrysotile undergoes dehydroxylation at temperatures between 550 [deg]C and 650 [deg]C, with subsequent transformation to forsterite,\23 24\ ashing temperatures should be kept below 500 [deg]C. Use of a low temperature asher is recommended. In all cases, calibration of the oven is essential to ensure that a maximum ashing temperature of 500 [deg]C is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.1.3 Acid leaching--Because of the interference caused by gypsum and some carbonates in the detection of asbestiform minerals by XRD (see Section 2.3.1), it may be necessary to remove these interferents by a simple acid leaching procedure prior to analysis (see Section 1.7.2.2).</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.2 Qualitative Analysis</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.2.1 Initial screening of bulk material-- Qualitative analysis should be performed on a representative, homogeneous portion of the sample with a minimum of sample treatment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Grind and mix the sample with a mortar and pestle (or equivalent method, see Section 2.7.2.1.1.) to a final particle size sufficiently small (100 [micro]m) to allow adequate packing into the sample holder.</p><p class="depth0">2. Pack the sample into a standard bulk sample holder. Care should be taken to ensure that a representative portion of the milled sample is selected for analysis. Particular care should be taken to avoid possible size segregation of the sample. (Note: Use of a back-packing method \25\ of bulk sample preparation may reduce preferred orientation effects.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Mount the sample on the diffractometer and scan over the diagnostic peak regions for

the serpentine (67.4 [Aring]) and amphibole (8.2-8.5 [Aring]) minerals (see Table 2-2). The X-ray diffraction equipment should be optimized for intensity. A slow scanning speed of 1[deg] 2[thetas]/min is recommended for adequate resolution. Use of a sample spinner is recommended.</p><p class="depth0">4. Submit all samples that exhibit diffraction peaks in the diagnostic regions for asbestiform minerals to a full qualitative XRD scan (5[deg]-60[deg] 2[thetas]; 1[deg]2[thetas]/min) to verify initial peak assignments and to identify potential matrix interferences when subsequent quantitative analysis is to be performed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Compare the sample XRD pattern with standard reference powder diffraction patterns (i.e., JCPDS powder diffraction data \3\ or those of other well-characterized reference materials). Principal lattice spacings of asbestiform minerals are given in Table 2-2; common constituents of bulk insulation and wall materials are listed in Table 2-3.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.2.2 Detection of minor or trace constituents-- Routine screening of bulk materials by XRD may fail to detect small concentrations (<5 percent) of asbestos. The limits of detection will, in general, be improved if matrix absorption effects are minimized, and if the sample particle size is reduced to the optimal 1 to 10 [micro]m range, provided that the crystal lattice is not degraded in the milling process. Therefore, in those instances where confirmation of the presence of an asbestiform mineral at very low levels is required, or where a negative result from initial screening of the bulk material by XRD (see Section 2.7.2.2.1) is in conflict with previous PLM results, it may be desirable to prepare the sample as described for quantitative analysis (see Section 2.7.2.3) and step-scan over appropriate 2[thetas] ranges of selected diagnostic peaks (Table 2-2). Accurate transfer of the sample to the silver membrane filter is not necessary unless subsequent quantitative analysis is to be performed.</p><p class="depth0">2.7.2.3 Quantitative Analysis</p><p class="depth0">The proposed method for quantitation of asbestos in bulk samples is a modification of the NIOSH-recommended thin-layer method for chrysotile in air. \5\ A thick-layer or bulk method involving pelletizing the sample may be used for semiquantitative analysis; \7 8\ however, this method requires the addition of an internal standard, use of a specially fabricated sample press, and relatively large amounts of standard reference materials. Additional research is required to evaluate the comparability of thin- and thick-layer methods for quantitative asbestos analysis.</p><p class="depth0">For quantitative analysis by thin-layer methods, the following procedure is recommended:</p><p class="depth0">1.

Analyze the selected diagnostic reflection(s) by step scanning in increments of 0.02[deg] 2[thetas] for an appropriate fixed time and integrating the counts.

An appropriate scanning interval should be selected for each peak, and background corrections made. For a fixed time scan, measure the

background on each side of the peak for one-half the peak-scanning time.

The intercept, b, of the line with the [Icirc]std axis should be approximately zero. A large negative intercept indicates an error in determining the background. This may arise from incorrectly measuring the baseline or from interference by another phase at the angle of background measurement. A large positive intercept indicates an error in determining the baseline or that an impurity is included in the measured peak.</p><p class="depth0">Using the normalized intensity, [Icirc]Ag, for the attenuated silver peak of a sample, and the corresponding normalized intensity from the unattenuated silver peak, [Icirc]Ag, of the sample filter, calculate the transmittance, T, for each sample as follows: \26 27\[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.019</p><p class="depth0">Determine the correction factor, f(T), for each sample according to the formula:</p><p class="depth0">......           -R (ln T)</p><p class="depth0">f (T)           --------</p><p class="depth0">=</p><p class="depth0">......             l-TR</p><p class="depth0">where</p><p class="depth0">.....          sin [Theta]Ag</p><p class="depth0">R =             --------</p><p class="depth0">.....           sin [Theta]a</p><p class="depth0">[thetas]Ag = angular position of the measured silver peak</p><p class="depth0">(from Bragg's Law), and[thetas]a = angular position of the diagnostic asbestos peak.</p><p class="depth0">Calculate the weight, Wa, in micrograms, of the asbestos material analyzed for in each sample, using the appropriate calibration data and absorption corrections:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01AP92.020</p><p class="depth0">Calculate the percent composition, Pa, of each asbestos mineral analyzed for in the parent material, from the total sample weight, WT, on the filter:</p><p class="depth0">.....
