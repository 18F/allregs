(1) At tank batteries and separation and treating areas where there is a reasonable possibility of a discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b), close and seal at all times drains of dikes or drains of equivalent measures required under Sec. 112.7(c)(1), except when draining uncontaminated rainwater. Prior to drainage, you must inspect the diked area and take action as provided in Sec. 112.8(c)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv). You must remove accumulated oil on the rainwater and return it to storage or dispose of it in accordance with legally approved methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At tank batteries and separation and treating areas where there is a reasonable possibility of a discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b), close and seal at all times drains of dikes or drains of equivalent measures required under Sec. 112.7(c)(1), except when draining uncontaminated rainwater. Prior to drainage, you must inspect the diked area and take action as provided in Sec. 112.8(c)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv).

appurtenances downstream from the container, construct all tank battery, separation, and treating facility installations, so that you provide a secondary means of containment for the entire capacity of the largest single container and sufficient freeboard to contain precipitation. You must safely confine drainage from undiked areas in a catchment basin or holding pond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section for flow-through process vessels and paragraph (c)(6) of this section for produced water containers and any associated piping and appurtenances downstream from the container, periodically and upon a regular schedule visually inspect each container of oil for deterioration and maintenance needs, including the foundation and support of each container that is on or above the surface of the ground.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engineer or update new and old tank battery installations in accordance with good engineering practice to prevent discharges. You must provide at least one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Container capacity adequate to assure that a container will not overfill if a pumper/gauger is delayed in making regularly scheduled rounds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Overflow equalizing lines between containers so that a full container can overflow to an adjacent container.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Vacuum protection adequate to prevent container collapse during a pipeline run or other transfer of oil from the container.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> High level sensors to generate and transmit an alarm signal to the computer where the facility is subject to a computer production control system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Flow-through process vessels.

For each produced water container, comply with Sec. 112.9(c)(1) and (c)(4); and Sec. 112.9(c)(2) and (c)(3), or comply with the provisions of the following paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (v):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Implement, on a regular schedule, a procedure for each produced water container that is designed to separate the free-phase oil that accumulates on the surface of the produced water. Include in the Plan a description of the procedures, frequency, amount of free-phase oil expected to be maintained inside the container, and a Professional Engineer certification in accordance with Sec. 112.3(d)(1)(vi). Maintain records of such events in accordance with Sec. 112.7(e). Records kept under usual and customary business practices will suffice for purposes of this paragraph. If this procedure is not implemented as described in the Plan or no records are maintained, then you must comply with Sec. 112.9(c)(2) and (c)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On a regular schedule, visually inspect and/or test the produced water container and associated piping for leaks, corrosion, or other conditions that could lead to a discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b) in accordance with good engineering practice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take corrective action or make repairs to the produced water container and any associated piping as indicated by regularly scheduled visual inspections, tests, or evidence of an oil discharge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Promptly remove or initiate actions to stabilize and remediate any accumulations of oil discharges associated with the produced water container.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If your facility discharges more than 1,000 U.S. gallons of oil in a single discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b), or discharges more than 42 U.S. gallons of oil in each of two discharges as described in Sec. 112.1(b) within any twelve month period from a produced water container subject to this subpart (excluding discharges that are the result of natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism) then you must, within six months from the time the facility becomes subject to this paragraph, ensure that all produced water containers subject to this subpart comply with Sec. 112.9(c)(2) and (c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Facility transfer operations, oil production facility.

The maintenance program must address your procedures to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that flowlines and intra-facility gathering lines and associated valves and equipment are compatible with the type of production fluids, their potential corrosivity, volume, and pressure, and other conditions expected in the operational environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Visually inspect and/or test flowlines and intra-facility gathering lines and associated appurtenances on a periodic and regular schedule for leaks, oil discharges, corrosion, or other conditions that could lead to a discharge as described in Sec. 112.1(b). For flowlines and intra-facility gathering lines that are not provided with secondary containment in accordance with Sec. 112.7(c), the frequency and type of testing must allow for the implementation of a contingency plan as described under part 109 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take corrective action or make repairs to any flowlines and intra-facility gathering lines and associated appurtenances as indicated by regularly scheduled visual inspections, tests, or evidence of a discharge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Promptly remove or initiate actions to stabilize and remediate any accumulations of oil discharges associated with flowlines, intra-facility gathering lines, and associated appurtenances.
