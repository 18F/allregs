In addition, if it is determined by the appropriate USDA agency  that the action of a person which would form the basis of any  ineligibility under this part was taken by such person in good-faith  reliance on erroneous advice, information, or action of any other  authorized representative of USDA, the appropriate agency may make such  benefits available to the extent that similar relief would be allowed  under 7 CFR part 718.</p>
