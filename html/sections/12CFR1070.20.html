                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information provided to the CFPB by a  business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request  except in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business information means commercial or financial information  obtained by the CFPB from a submitter that may be protected from  disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person from whom the CFPB obtains business  information, directly or indirectly. The term includes, without  limitation, corporations, State, local, and tribal governments, and  foreign governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation of business information. A submitter of business  information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate  markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time  thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. These  designations will expire ten (10) years after the date of the submission  unless the submitter requests otherwise and provides justification for,  a longer designation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to submitters. The CFPB shall provide a submitter with  prompt written notice of receipt of a request or appeal encompassing its  business information whenever required in accordance with paragraph (e)  of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact  nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the  records or portions of records containing the business information. When  notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required,  notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place  reasonably likely to accomplish it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When notice is required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CFPB shall provide a submitter  with notice of receipt of a request or appeal whenever:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information has been designated in good faith by the  submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under  Exemption 4; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The CFPB has reason to believe that the information may be  protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The CFPB determines that the information is exempt under the  FOIA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made  available to the public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other  than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the  requirements of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (e)(1)(i)  of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a  case, the CFPB shall, within a reasonable time prior to a specified  disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision  to disclose the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Through the notice  described in paragraph (d) of this section, the CFPB shall afford a  submitter ten (10) business days from the date of the notice to provide  the CFPB with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such  statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the  information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of  Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is considered to be a  trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged  or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the  notice within the time specified in it, the submitter shall be  considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information.  Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may  itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the  requester shall be advised that such notice has been given to the  submitter. The requester shall be further advised   that a delay in responding to the request may be considered a denial of  access to records and that the requester may proceed with an  administrative appeal or seek judicial review, if appropriate. However,  the requester will be invited to agree to a voluntary extension of time  so that the CFPB may review the submitter's objection to disclose, if  any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. The CFPB shall consider carefully  a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to  determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the CFPB  decides to disclose business information over the objection of a  submitter, the CFPB shall forward to the submitter a written notice  which shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure  objections were not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date which is not less than ten (10)  business days after the notice of the final decision to release the  requested information has been mailed to the submitter. Except as  otherwise prohibited by law, a copy of the disclosure notice shall be  forwarded to the requester at the same time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice to submitter of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings  suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information, the CFPB  shall promptly notify the submitter of that business information of the  existence of the suit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notice to requester of business information. The CFPB shall  notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an  opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter  of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a  submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</p>
