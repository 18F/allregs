                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An incumbent LEC shall provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the incumbent LEC's network:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the transmission and routing of telephone exchange traffic, exchange access traffic, or both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At any technically feasible point within the incumbent LEC's network including, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The line-side of a local switch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The trunk-side of a local switch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The trunk interconnection points for a tandem switch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Central office cross-connect points;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Out-of-band signaling transfer points necessary to exchange traffic at these points and access call-related databases; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The points of access to unbundled network elements as described in Sec. 51.319;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That is at a level of quality that is equal to that which the incumbent LEC provides itself, a subsidiary, an affiliate, or any other party. At a minimum, this requires an incumbent LEC to design interconnection facilities to meet the same technical criteria and service standards that are used within the incumbent LEC's network. This obligation is not limited to a consideration of service quality as perceived by end users, and includes, but is not limited to, service quality as perceived by the requesting telecommunications carrier; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On terms and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of any agreement, the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Act, and the Commission's rules including, but not limited to, offering such terms and conditions equally to all requesting telecommunications carriers, and offering such terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions upon which the incumbent LEC provides such interconnection to itself. This includes, but is not limited to, the time within which the incumbent LEC provides such interconnection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A carrier that requests interconnection solely for the purpose of

originating or terminating its interexchange traffic on an incumbent LEC's network and not for the purpose of providing to others telephone exchange service, exchange access service, or both, is not entitled to receive interconnection pursuant to section 251(c)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Previous successful interconnection at a particular point in a network, using particular facilities, constitutes substantial evidence that interconnection is technically feasible at that point, or at substantially similar points, in networks employing substantially similar facilities. Adherence to the same interface or protocol standards shall constitute evidence of the substantial similarity of network facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Previous successful interconnection at a particular point in a network at a particular level of quality constitutes substantial evidence that interconnection is technically feasible at that point, or at substantially similar points, at that level of quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An incumbent LEC that denies a request for interconnection at a particular point must prove to the state commission that interconnection at that point is not technically feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If technically feasible, an incumbent LEC shall provide two-way trunking upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An incumbent LEC shall provide to a requesting telecommunications carrier technical information about the incumbent LEC's network facilities sufficient to allow the requesting carrier to achieve interconnection consistent with the requirements of this section.
