                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EPA permits. When EPA is the permit-issuing authority, the conditions of an expired permit continue in force under 5 U.S.C. 558(c) until the effective date of a new permit if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The permittee has submitted a timely application which is a complete application for a new permit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator, through no fault of the permittee does not issue a new permit with an effective date on or before the expiration date of the previous permit (for example, when issuance is impracticable due to time or resource constraints).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect. Permits continued under this section remain fully effective and enforceable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement. When the permittee is not in compliance with the conditions of the expiring or expired permit the Regional Administrator may choose to do any or all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initiate enforcement action based upon the permit which has been continued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issue a notice of intent to deny the new permit. If the permit is denied, the owner or operator would then be required to cease the activities authorized by the continued permit or be subject to enforcement action for operating without a permit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issue a new permit under part 124 with appropriate conditions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Take other actions authorized by these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State continuation. An EPA issued permit does not continue in force beyond its time expiration date under Federal law if at that time a State is the permitting authority. A State authorized to administer the UIC program may continue either EPA or State-issued permits until the effective date of the new permits, if State law allows. Otherwise, the facility or activity is operating without a permit from the time of expiration of the old permit to the effective date of the State-issued new permit.</p>
