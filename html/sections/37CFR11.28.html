                                Sec.  11.28  Incapacitated practitioners in a disciplinary proceeding.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Holding in abeyance a disciplinary proceeding because of incapacitation due to a current disability or addiction--(1) Practitioner's motion. In the course of a disciplinary proceeding under Sec.  11.32, but before the date set by the hearing officer for a hearing, the practitioner may file a motion requesting the hearing officer to enter an order holding such proceeding in abeyance based on the contention that the practitioner is suffering from a disability or addiction that makes it impossible for the practitioner to adequately defend the charges in the disciplinary proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Content of practitioner's motion. The practitioner's motion shall, in addition to any other requirement of Sec.  11.43, include or have attached thereto:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A brief statement of all material facts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Affidavits, medical reports, official records, or other documents and the opinion of at least one medical expert setting forth and establishing any of the material facts on which the practitioner is relying;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A statement that the practitioner acknowledges the alleged incapacity by reason of disability or addiction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Written consent that the practitioner be transferred to disability inactive status if the motion is granted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A written agreement by the practitioner to not practice before the Office in patent, trademark or other non-patent cases while on disability inactive status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Response. The OED Director's response to any motion hereunder shall be served and filed within thirty days after service of the practitioner's motion unless such time is shortened or enlarged by the hearing officer for good cause shown, and shall set forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All objections, if any, to the actions requested in the motion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An admission, denial or allegation of lack of knowledge with respect to each of the material facts in the practitioner's motion and accompanying documents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Affidavits, medical reports, official records, or other documents setting forth facts on which the OED Director intends to rely for purposes of disputing or denying any material fact set forth in the practitioner's papers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disposition of practitioner's motion. The hearing officer shall decide the motion and any response thereto. The motion shall be granted upon a showing of good cause to believe the practitioner to be incapacitated as alleged. If the required showing is made, the hearing officer shall enter an order holding the disciplinary proceeding in abeyance. In the case of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, the order may provide that the practitioner will not be returned to active status absent satisfaction of specified conditions. Upon receipt of the order, the OED Director shall transfer the practitioner to disability inactive status, give notice to the practitioner, cause notice to be published, and give notice to appropriate authorities in the Office that the practitioner has been placed on disability inactive status. The practitioner shall comply with the provisions of Sec.  11.58, and shall not engage in practice before the Office in patent, trademark and other non-patent law until a determination is made of the practitioner's capability to resume practice before the Office in a proceeding under paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section. A practitioner on disability inactive status must seek permission from the OED Director to engage in an activity authorized under Sec.  11.58(e). Permission will be granted only if the practitioner has complied with all the conditions of Sec. Sec.  11.58(a) through 11.58(d) applicable to disability inactive status. In the event that permission is granted, the practitioner shall fully comply with the provisions of Sec.  11.58(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motion for reactivation. Any practitioner transferred to disability inactive status in a disciplinary proceeding may file with the hearing officer a motion for reactivation once a year beginning at any time not less than one year

after the initial effective date of inactivation, or once during any shorter interval provided by the order issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section or any modification thereof. If the motion is granted, the disciplinary proceeding shall resume under such schedule as may be established by the hearing officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contents of motion for reactivation. A motion by the practitioner for reactivation alleging that a practitioner has recovered from a prior disability or addiction shall be accompanied by all available medical reports or similar documents relating thereto. The hearing officer may require the practitioner to present such other information as is necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> OED Director's motion to resume disciplinary proceeding held in abeyance. (1) The OED Director, having good cause to believe a practitioner is no longer incapacitated, may file a motion requesting the hearing officer to terminate a prior order holding in abeyance any pending proceeding because of the practitioner's disability or addiction. The hearing officer shall decide the matter presented by the OED Director's motion hereunder based on the affidavits and other admissible evidence attached to the OED Director's motion and the practitioner's response. The OED Director bears the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the practitioner is able to defend himself or herself. If there is any genuine issue as to one or more material facts, the hearing officer will hold an evidentiary hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The hearing officer, upon receipt of the OED Director's motion under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may direct the practitioner to file a response. If the hearing officer requires the practitioner to file a response, the practitioner must present clear and convincing evidence that the prior self-alleged disability or addiction continues to make it impossible for the practitioner to defend himself or herself in the underlying proceeding being held in abeyance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Action by the hearing officer. If, in deciding a motion under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the hearing officer determines that there is good cause to believe the practitioner is not incapacitated from defending himself or herself, or is not incapacitated from practicing before the Office, the hearing officer shall take such action as is deemed appropriate, including the entry of an order directing the reactivation of the practitioner and resumption of the disciplinary proceeding.</p>
