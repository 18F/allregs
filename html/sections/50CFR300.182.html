                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An importer, entering for consumption fish or fish products regulated under this subpart from any ocean area into the United States, or an exporter exporting or re-exporting such product, must possess a valid trade permit issued under this section. Importation of fish or fish products regulated under this subpart by nonresident corporations is restricted to those entities authorized under 19 CFR 141.18. A resident agent or resident corporate surety provider, as specified under 19 CFR 141.18, must possess a valid trade permit when acting on behalf of a nonresident corporation when entering for consumption, exporting, or re-exporting fish or fish products regulated under this subpart from any ocean area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A person must apply for a permit in writing on an appropriate form obtained from NMFS. The application must be completed, signed by the applicant, and submitted with required supporting documents, at least 30 days before the date on which the applicant wants to have the permit made effective. Application forms and instructions for their completion are available from NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Issuance. NMFS will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the application, including failure to provide information or reports required under this subpart. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration. Any permit issued under this section is valid for the period specified on it, unless suspended or revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alteration. Any permit that is substantially altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Replacement. NMFS may issue replacement permits. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application. An appropriate fee, consistent with paragraph (j) of this section, may be charged for issuance of a replacement permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable or assignable; it is valid only for the permit holder to whom it is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Inspection. The permit holder must keep the permit issued under this section at his/her principal place of business. The permit must be displayed for inspection upon request of any authorized officer, or any employee of NMFS designated by NMFS for such purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Sanctions. The Assistant Administrator may suspend, revoke, modify, or deny a permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures governing permit sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fees. NMFS may charge a fee to recover the administrative expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee is calculated, at least annually, in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from NMFS, for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified on each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by a commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded shall invalidate any permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Change in application information. Within 30 days after any change in the information contained in an application submitted under this section, the permit holder must report the change to NMFS in writing. If a change in permit information is not reported within 30 days, the permit is void as of the 31\st\ day after such change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Renewal. Persons must apply annually for a trade permit issued under this section. A renewal application must be submitted to NMFS, at an address designated by NMFS, at least 30 days before the permit expiration date to avoid a lapse of permitted status. NMFS will renew a permit provided that: the application for the requested permit is complete; all reports required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, ATCA, and the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 have been submitted, including those required under Sec. Sec. 300.183, 300.185, 300.186, and 300.187 and 635.5 of this title; and the applicant is not subject to a permit sanction or denial under paragraph (i) of this section.
