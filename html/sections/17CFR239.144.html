Disclosure of the information specified in this form is mandatory before processing notices of proposed sale of securities under Sec. 230.144 of this chapter. The information will be used for the primary purpose of disclosing the proposed sale of unregistered securities by persons deemed not to be engaged in the distribution of securities. This notice will be made a matter of public record. Therefore, any information given will be available for inspection by any member of the public. Because of the public nature of the information, the Commission can utilize it for a variety of purposes, including referral to other governmental authorities or securities self-regulatory organizations for investigatory purposes or in connection with litigation involving the Federal securities laws or other civil, criminal or regulatory statutes or provisions. Failure to disclose the information requested by Form 144 would make an exception under Sec. 230.144 of this chapter unavailable and may result in civil or criminal action for violations of the Federal securities laws.
