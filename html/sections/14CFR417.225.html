A debris risk analysis must account for  risk to populations on land, including regions of launch vehicle flight  following passage through any gate in a flight safety limit established  as required by Sec. 417.217. A debris risk analysis must account for  any potential casualties to the public as required by the debris  thresholds and requirements of Sec. 417.107(c).</p>
