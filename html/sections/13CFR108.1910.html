                            <p class="depth0">SBA's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy  under the Act or the regulations in this part does not constitute a  waiver of such right or remedy. SBA's failure to require you to perform  any term or provision of your Leverage does not affect SBA's right to  enforce such term or provision. Similarly, SBA's waiver of, or failure  to enforce, any term or provision of your Leverage or of any event or  condition set forth in Sec. 108.1810 does not constitute a waiver of any  succeeding breach of such term or provision or condition.</p>
