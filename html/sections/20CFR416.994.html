                                Sec. 416.994  How we will determine whether your disability continues
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. There is a statutory requirement that, if you are  entitled to disability benefits, your continued entitlement to such  benefits must be reviewed periodically. Our rules for deciding whether  your disability continues are set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section. Additional rules apply if you were found disabled under a State  plan, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(4)</em> of this section for exceptions) we  must also show that you are currently able to engage in substantial  gainful activity before we can find that you are no longer disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terms and definitions. There are several terms and definitions  which are important to know in order to understand how we review whether  your disability continues. In addition, see paragraph (b)(8) of this  section if you work during your current period of eligibility based on  disability or during certain other periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medical improvement. Medical improvement is any decrease in the  medical severity of your impairment(s) which was present at the time of  the most recent favorable medical decision that you were disabled or  continued to be disabled. A determination that there has been a decrease  in medical severity must be based on changes (improvement) in the  symptoms, signs and/or   laboratory findings associated with your impairment(s) (see  Sec. 416.928).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: You were awarded disability benefits due to a herniated  nucleus pulposus. At the time of our prior decision granting you  benefits you had had a laminectomy. Postoperatively, a myelogram still  shows evidence of a persistent deficit in your lumbar spine. You had  pain in your back, and pain and a burning sensation in your right foot  and leg. There were no muscle weakness or neurological changes and a  modest decrease in motion in your back and leg. When we reviewed your  claim your treating physician reported that he had seen you regularly  every 2 to 3 months for the past 2 years. No further myelograms had been  done, complaints of pain in the back and right leg continued especially  on sitting or standing for more than a short period of time. Your doctor  further reported a moderately decreased range of motion in your back and  right leg, but again no muscle atrophy or neurological changes were  reported. Medical improvement has not occurred because there has been no  decrease in the severity of your back impairment as shown by changes in  symptoms, signs or laboratory findings.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: You were awarded disability benefits due to rheumatoid  arthritis. At the time, laboratory findings were positive for this  condition. Your doctor reported persistent swelling and tenderness of  your fingers and wrists and that you complained of joint pain. Current  medical evidence shows that while laboratory tests are still positive  for rheumatoid arthritis, your impairment has responded favorably to  therapy so that for the last year your fingers and wrists have not been  significantly swollen or painful. Medical improvement has occurred  because there has been a decrease in the severity of your impairment as  documented by the current symptoms and signs reported by your physician.  Although your impairment is subject to temporary remissions and  exacerbations, the improvement that has occurred has been sustained long  enough to permit a finding of medical improvement. We would then  determine if this medical improvement is related to your ability to  work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Medical improvement not related to ability to do work. Medical  improvement is not related to your ability to work if there has been a  decrease in the severity of the impairment(s) as defined in paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section, present at the time of the most recent  favorable medical decision, but no increase in your functional capacity  to do basic work activities as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this  section. If there has been any medical improvement in your  impairment(s), but it is not related to your ability to do work and none  of the exceptions applies, your benefits will be continued.</p><p class="depth0">Example: You are 65 inches tall and weighed 246 pounds at the time  your disability was established. You had venous insufficiency and  persistent edema in your legs. At the time, your ability to do basic  work activities was affected because you were able to sit for 6 hours,  but were able to stand or walk only occasionally. At the time of our  continuing disability review, you had undergone a vein stripping  operation. You now weigh 220 pounds and have intermittent edema. You are  still able to sit for 6 hours at a time and to stand or work only  occasionally although you report less discomfort on walking. Medical  improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease in the  severity of the existing impairment as shown by your weight loss and the  improvement in your edema. This medical improvement is not related to  your ability to work, however, because your functional capacity to do  basic work activities (i.e., the ability to sit, stand and walk) has not  increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Medical improvement that is related to ability to do work.  Medical improvement is related to your ability to work if there has been  a decrease in the severity, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section, of the impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent  favorable medical decision and an increase in your functional capacity  to do basic work activities as discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this  section. A determination that medical improvement related to your  ability to do work has occurred does not, necessarily, mean that your  disability will be found to have ended unless it is also shown that you  are currently able to engage in substantial gainful activity as  discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: You have a back impairment and had a laminectomy to  relieve the nerve root impingement and weakness in your left leg. At the  time of our prior decision, basic work activities were affected because  you were able to stand less than 6 hours, and sit no more than \1/2\  hour at a time. You had a successful fusion operation on your back about  1 year before our review of your entitlement. At the time of our review,  the weakness in your leg has decreased. Your functional capacity to  perform basic work activities now is unimpaired because you now have no  limitation on your ability to sit, walk, or stand. Medical improvement  has occurred because there has been a decrease   in the severity of your impairment as demonstrated by the decreased  weakness in your leg. This medical improvement is related to your  ability to work because there has also been an increase in your  functional capacity to perform basic work activities (or residual  functional capacity) as shown by the absence of limitation on your  ability to sit, walk, or stand. Whether or not your disability is found  to have ended, however, will depend on our determination as to whether  you can currently engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: You were injured in an automobile accident receiving a  compound fracture to your right femur and a fractured pelvis. When you  applied for disability benefits 10 months after the accident your doctor  reported that neither fracture had yet achieved solid union based on his  clinical examination. X-rays supported this finding. Your doctor  estimated that solid union and a subsequent return to full weight  bearing would not occur for at least 3 more months. At the time of our  review 6 months later, solid union had occurred and you had been  returned to weight-bearing for over a month. Your doctor reported this  and the fact that your prior fractures no longer placed any limitation  on your ability to walk, stand, lift, etc., and, that in fact, you could  return to fulltime work if you so desired.</p><p class="depth0">Medical improvement has occurred because there has been a decrease  in the severity of your impairments as shown by X-ray and clinical  evidence of solid union and your return to full weight-bearing. This  medical improvement is related to your ability to work because you no  longer meet the same listed impairment in appendix 1 of subpart P of  part 404 of this chapter (see paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section).  In fact, you no longer have an impairment which is severe (see  Sec. 416.921) and your disability will be found to have ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Functional capacity to do basic work activities. Under the law,  disability is defined, in part, as the inability to do any substantial  gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or  mental impairment(s). In determining whether you are disabled under the  law, we must measure, therefore, how and to what extent your  impairment(s) has affected your ability to do work. We do this by  looking at how your functional capacity for doing basic work activities  has been affected. Basic work activities means the abilities and  aptitudes necessary to do most jobs. Included are exertional abilities  such as walking, standing, pushing, pulling, reaching and carrying, and  nonexertional abilities and aptitudes such as seeing, hearing, speaking,  remembering, using judgment, dealing with changes and dealing with both  supervisors and fellow workers. A person who has no impairment(s) would  be able to do all basic work activities at normal levels; he or she  would have an unlimited functional capacity to do basic work activities.  Depending on its nature and severity, an impairment will result in some  limitation to the functional capacity to do one or more of these basic  work activities. Diabetes, for example, can result in circulatory  problems which could limit the length of time a person could stand or  walk and damage to his or her eyes as well, so that the person also had  limited vision. What a person can still do despite an impairment, is  called his or her residual functional capacity. How the residual  functional capacity is assessed is discussed in more detail in  Sec. 416.945. Unless an impairment is so severe that it is deemed to  prevent you from doing substantial gainful activity (see Secs. 416.925  and 416.926) it is this residual functional capacity that is used to  determine whether you can still do your past work or, in conjunction  with your age, education and work experience, any other work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A decrease in the severity of an impairment as measured by  changes (improvement) in symptoms, signs or laboratory findings can, if  great enough, result in an increase in the functional capacity to do  work activities. Vascular surgery (e.g., femoropopliteal bypass) may  sometimes reduce the severity of the circulatory complications of  diabetes so that better circulation results and the person can stand or  walk for longer periods. When new evidence showing a change in symptoms,  signs and laboratory findings establishes that both medical improvement  has occurred and your functional capacity to perform basic work  activities, or residual functional capacity, has increased, we say that  medical improvement which is related to your ability to do work has  occurred. A residual functional capacity assessment is also used to  determine whether you can engage in substantial gainful activity and,  thus, whether you   continue to be disabled (see paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Many impairment-related factors must be considered in assessing  your functional capacity for basic work activities. Age is one key  factor. Medical literature shows that there is a gradual decrease in  organ function with age; that major losses and deficits become  irreversible over time and that maximum exercise performance diminishes  with age. Other changes related to sustained periods of inactivity and  the aging process include muscle atrophy, degenerative joint changes,  decrease in range of motion, and changes in the cardiac and respiratory  systems which limit the exertional range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Studies have also shown that the longer an individual is away  from the workplace and is inactive, the more difficult it becomes to  return to ongoing gainful employment. In addition, a gradual change  occurs in most jobs so that after about 15 years, it is no longer  realistic to expect that skills and abilities acquired in these jobs  will continue to apply to the current workplace. Thus, if you are age 50  or over and have been receiving disability benefits for a considerable  period of time, we will consider this factor along with your age in  assessing your residual functional capacity. This will ensure that the  disadvantages resulting from inactivity and the aging process during a  long period of disability will be considered. In some instances where  available evidence does not resolve what you can or cannot do on a  sustained basis, we will provide special work evaluations or other  appropriate testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. In most  instances, we must show that you are able to engage in substantial  gainful activity before your benefits are stopped. When doing this, we  will consider all your current impairments not just that impairment(s)  present at the time of the most recent favorable determination. If we  cannot determine that you are still disabled based on medical  consideration alone (as discussed in Secs. 416.925 and 416.926), we will  use the new symptoms, signs and laboratory findings to make an objective  assessment of your functional capacity to do basic work activities or  residual functional capacity and we will consider your vocational  factors. See Secs. 416.945 through 416.969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Evidence and basis for our decision. Our decisions under this  section will be made on a neutral basis without any initial inference as  to the presence or absence of disability being drawn from the fact that  you have previously been determined to be disabled. We will consider all  evidence you submit, as well as all evidence we obtain from your  treating physician(s) and other medical or nonmedical sources. What  constitutes ``evidence'' and our procedures for obtaining it are set out  in Secs. 416.912 through 416.918. Our determination regarding whether  your disability continues will be made on the basis of the weight of the  evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Point of comparison. For purpose of determining whether  medical improvement has occurred, we will compare the current medical  severity of that impairment(s) which was present at the time of the most  recent favorable medical decision that you were disabled or continued to  be disabled to the medical severity of that impairment(s) at that time.  If medical improvement has occurred, we will compare your current  functional capacity to do basic work activities (i.e., your residual  functional capacity) based on the previously existing impairments with  your prior residual functional capacity in order to determine whether  the medical improvement is related to your ability to do work. The most  recent favorable medical decision is the latest decision involving a  consideration of the medical evidence and the issue of whether you were  disabled or continued to be disabled which became final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining medical improvement and its relationship to your  abilities to do work. Paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this  section discuss what we mean by medical improvement, medical improvement  not related to your ability to work, and medical improvement that is  related to your ability to work. (In addition, see paragraph (b)(8) of  this section if you work during your current period of eligibility based  on disability or during certain other periods.) How we will arrive at  the decision that medical improvement has   occurred and its relationship to the ability to do work, is discussed  below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medical improvement. Medical improvement is any decrease in the  medical severity of impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent  favorable medical decision that you were disabled or continued to be  disabled and is determined by a comparison of prior and current medical  evidence which must show that there have been changes (improvement) in  the symptoms, signs or laboratory findings associated with that  impairment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining if medical improvement is related to ability to  work. If there is a decrease in medical severity as shown by the  symptoms, signs and laboratory findings, we then must determine if it is  related to your ability to do work. In paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this  section, we explain the relationship between medical severity and  limitation on functional capacity to do basic work activities (or  residual functional capacity) and how changes in medical severity can  affect your residual functional capacity. In determining whether medical  improvement that has occurred is related to your ability to do work, we  will assess your residual functional capacity (in accordance with  paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section) based on the current severity of  the impairment(s) which was present at your last favorable medical  decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Your new residual functional capacity will then be compared to  your residual functional capacity at the time of our most recent  favorable medical decision. Unless an increase in the current residual  functional capacity is based on actual changes in the signs, symptoms,  or laboratory findings any medical improvement that has occurred will  not be considered to be related to your ability to do work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Following are some additional factors and considerations which  we will apply in making these determinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Previous impairment met or equaled listings. If our most recent  favorable decision was based on the fact that your impairment(s) at the  time met or equaled the severity contemplated by the Listing of  Impairments in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter, an  assessment of your residual functional capacity would not have been  made. If medical improvement has occurred and the severity of the prior  impairment(s) no longer meets or equals the same listing section used to  make our most recent favorable decision, we will find that the medical  improvement was related to your ability to work. Appendix 1 of subpart P  of part 404 of this chapter describes impairments which, if severe  enough, affect a person's ability to work. If the appendix level  severity is met or equaled the individual is deemed, in the absence of  evidence to the contrary, to be unable to engage in gainful activity. If  there has been medical improvement to the degree that the requirement of  the listing section is no longer met or equaled, then the medical  improvement is related to your ability to work. We must, of course, also  establish that you can currently engage in substantial gainful activity  before finding that your disability has ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prior residual functional capacity assessment made. The residual  functional capacity assessment used in making the most recent favorable  medical decision will be compared to the residual functional capacity  assessment based on current evidence in order to determine if your  functional capacity for basic work activities has increased. There will  be no attempt made to reassess the prior residual functional capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prior residual functional capacity assessment should have been  made, but was not. If the most recent favorable medical decision should  have contained an assessment of your residual functional capacity (i.e.,  your impairments did not meet or equal the level of severity  contemplated by the Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 of subpart P of  part 404 of this chapter) but does not, either because this assessment  is missing from your file or because it was not done, we will  reconstruct the residual functional capacity. This reconstructed  residual functional capacity will accurately and objectively assess your  functional capacity to do basic work activities. We will assign the  maximum functional capacity consistent with a decision of allowance.</p><p class="depth0">Example: You were previously found to be disabled on the basis that  ``while your impairment did not meet or equal a listing, it did prevent  you from doing your past or any other work.'' The prior adjudicator did  not, however, include a residual functional capacity assessment in the  rationale of this decision and a review of the prior evidence does not  show that such an assessment was ever made. If a decrease in medical  severity, i.e., medical improvement, has occurred, the residual  functional capacity based on the current level of severity of your  impairment will have to be compared with your residual functional  capacity based on its prior severity in order to determine if the  medical improvement is related to your ability to do work. In order to  make this comparison, we will review the prior evidence and make an  objective assessment of your residual functional capacity at the time of  our most recent favorable medical determination, based on the symptoms,  signs and laboratory findings as they then existed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Impairment subject to temporary remission. In some cases the  evidence shows that an individual's impairments are subject to temporary  remission. In assessing whether medical improvement has occurred in  persons with this type of impairment, we will be careful to consider the  longitudinal history of the impairment, including the occurrence of  prior remission, and prospects for future worsenings. Improvement in  such impairments that is only temporary will not warrant a finding of  medical improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Prior file cannot be located. If the prior file cannot be  located, we will first determine whether you are able to now engage in  substantial gainful activity based on all your current impairments. (In  this way, we will be able to determine that your disability continues at  the earliest point without addressing the often lengthy process of  reconstructing prior evidence.) If you cannot engage in substantial  gainful activity currently, your benefits will continue unless one of  the second group of exceptions applies (see paragraph (b)(4) of this  section). If you are able to engage in substantial gainful activity, we  will determine whether an attempt should be made to reconstruct those  portions of the missing file that were relevant to our most recent  favorable medical decision (e.g., work history, medical evidence from  treating sources and the results of consultative examinations). This  determination will consider the potential availability of old records in  light of their age, whether the source of the evidence is still in  operation , and whether reconstruction efforts will yield a complete  record of the basis for the most recent favorable medical decision. If  relevant parts of the prior record are not reconstructed either because  it is determined not to attempt reconstruction or because such efforts  fail, medical improvement cannot be found. The documentation of your  current impairments will provide a basis for any future reviews. If the  missing file is later found, it may serve as a basis for reopening any  decision under this section in accordance with Sec. 416.988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First group of exceptions to medical improvement. The law  provides for certain limited situations when your disability can be  found to have ended even though medical improvement has not occurred, if  you can engage in substantial gainful activity. These exceptions to  medical improvement are intended to provide a way of finding that a  person is no longer disabled in those limited situations where, even  though there has been no decrease in severity of the impairment(s),  evidence shows that the person should no longer be considered disabled  or never should have been considered disabled. If one of these  exceptions applies, we must also show that, taking all your current  impairment(s) into account, not just those that existed at the time of  our most recent favorable medical decision, you are now able to engage  in substantial gainful activity before your disability can be found to  have ended. As part of the review process, you will be asked about any  medical or vocational therapy you received or are receiving. Your  answers and the evidence gathered as a result as well as all other  evidence, will serve as the basis for the finding that an exception  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantial evidence shows that you are the beneficiary of  advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to your  ability to work). Advances in medical or vocational therapy or  technology are improvements in treatment or rehabilitative methods which  have increased your ability to do basic   work activities. We will apply this exception when substantial evidence  shows that you have been the beneficiary of services which reflect these  advances and they have favorably affected the severity of your  impairment or your ability to do basic work activities. This decision  will be based on new medical evidence and a new residual functional  capacity assessment. (See Sec. 416.945.) This exception does not apply  if you are eligible to receive special Supplemental Security Income cash  benefits as explained in Sec. 416.261. In many instances, an advanced  medical therapy or technology will result in a decrease in severity as  shown by symptoms, signs and laboratory findings which will meet the  definition of medical improvement. This exception will, therefore, see  very limited application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial evidence shows that you have undergone vocational  therapy (related to your ability to work). Vocational therapy (related  to your ability to work) may include, but is not limited to, additional  education, training, or work experience that improves your ability to  meet the vocational requirements of more jobs. This decision will be  based on substantial evidence which includes new medical evidence and a  new residual functional capacity assessment. (See Sec. 416.945.) This  exception does not apply if you are eligible to receive special  Supplemental Security Income cash benefits as explained in Sec. 416.261.  If, at the time of our review, you have not completed vocational therapy  which could affect the continuance of your disability, we will review  your claim upon completion of the therapy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: You were found to be disabled because the limitations  imposed on you by your impairment allowed you to only do work that was  at a sedentary level of exertion. Your prior work experience was work  that required a medium level of exertion. Your age and education at the  time would not have qualified you for work that was below this medium  level of exertion. You enrolled in and completed a specialized training  course which qualifies you for a job in data processing as a computer  programmer in the period since you were awarded benefits. On review of  your claim, current evidence shows that there is no medical improvement  and that you can still do only sedentary work. As the work of a computer  programmer is sedentary in nature, you are now able to engage in  substantial gainful activity when your new skills are considered.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: You were previously entitled to benefits because the  medical evidence and assessment of your residual functional capacity  showed you could only do light work. Your prior work was considered to  be heavy in nature and your age, education and the nature of your prior  work qualified you for work which was no less than medium in exertion.  The current evidence and residual functional capacity show there has  been no medical improvement and that you can still do only light work.  Since you were originally entitled to benefits, your vocational  rehabilitation agency enrolled you in and you successfully completed a  trade school course so that you are now qualified to do small appliance  repair. This work is light in nature, so when your new skills are  considered, you are now able to engage in substantial gainful activity  even though there has been no change in your residual functional  capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substantial evidence shows that based on new or improved  diagnostic or evaluative techniques your impairment(s) is not as  disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent  favorable decision. Changing methodologies and advances in medical and  other diagnostic or evaluative techniques have given, and will continue  to give, rise to improved methods for measuring and documenting the  effect of various impairments on the ability to do work. Where, by such  new or improved methods, substantial evidence shows that your  impairment(s) is not as severe as was determined at the time of our most  recent favorable medical decision, such evidence may serve as a basis  for finding that you are no longer disabled, if you can currently engage  in substantial gainful activity. In order to be used under this  exception, however, the new or improved techniques must have become  generally available after the date of our most recent favorable medical  decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> How we will determine which methods are new or improved  techniques and when they become generally available. New or improved  diagnostic techniques or evaluations will come to our attention by  several methods. In reviewing cases, we often become aware of new  techniques when their results are presented as evidence. Such techniques  and evaluations are also discussed and acknowledged in medical  literature by   medical professional groups and other governmental entities. Through  these sources, we develop listings of new techniques and when they  become generally available. For example, we will consult the Health Care  Financing Administration for its experience regarding when a technique  is recognized for payment under Medicare and when they began paying for  the technique.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> How you will know which methods are new or improved techniques  and when they become generally available. We will let you know which  methods we consider to be new or improved techniques and when they  become available through two vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Some of the future changes in the Listing of Impairments in  appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter will be based on new  or improved diagnostic or evaluation techniques. Such listings changes  will clearly state this fact as they are published as Notices of  Proposed Rulemaking and the new or improved techniques will be  considered generally available as of the date of the final publication  of that particular listing in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A cumulative list since 1970 of new or approved diagnostic  techniques or evaluations, how they changed the evaluation of the  applicable impairment and the month and year they became generally  available, will be published in the Notices section of the Federal  Register. Included will be any changes in the Listing of Impairments  published in the Code of Federal Regulations since 1970 which are  reflective of new or improved techniques. No cases will be processed  under this exception until this cumulative listing is so published.  Subsequent changes to the list will be published periodically. The  period will be determined by the volume of changes needed.</p><p class="depth0">Example: The electrocardiographic exercise test has replaced the  Master's 2-step test as a measurement of heart function since the time  of your last favorable medical decision. Current evidence could show  that your condition, which was previously evaluated based on the  Master's 2-step test, is not now as disabling as was previously thought.  If, taking all your current impairments into account, you are now able  to engage in substantial gainful activity, this exception would be used  to find that you are no longer disabled even if medical improvement has  not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Substantial evidence demonstrates that any prior disability  decision was in error. We will apply the exception to medical  improvement based on error if substantial evidence (which may be  evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the  entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly obtained  evidence which relates to that determination) demonstrates that a prior  determination was in error. A prior determination will be found in error  only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Substantial evidence shows on its face that the decision in  question should not have been made (e.g., the evidence in your file such  as pulmonary function study values was misread or an adjudicative  standard such as a listing in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of  this chapter or a medical/vocational rule in appendix 2 of subpart P of  part 404 of this chapter was misapplied).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: You were granted benefits when it was determined that  your epilepsy met Listing 11.02. This listing calls for a finding of  major motor seizures more frequently than once a month as documented by  electroencephalogram evidence and by a detailed description of a typical  seizure pattern. A history of either diurnal episodes or nocturnal  episodes with residuals interfering with daily activities is also  required. On review, it is found that a history of the frequency of your  seizures showed that they occurred only once or twice a year. The prior  decision would be found to be in error, and whether you were still  considered to be disabled would be based on whether you could currently  engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: Your prior award of benefits was based on vocational rule  201.12 in appendix 2 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter. This rule  applies to a person age 50-54 who has at least a high school education,  whose previous work was entirely at a semiskilled level, and who can do  only sedentary work. On review, it is found that at the time of the  prior determination you were actually only age 46 and vocational rule  201.21 should have been used. This rule would have called for a denial  of your claim and the prior decision is found to have been in error.  Continuation of your disability would depend on a finding of your  current ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At the time of the prior evaluation, required and material  evidence of   the severity of your impairment(s) was missing. That evidence becomes  available upon review, and substantial evidence demonstrates that had  such evidence been present at the time of the prior determination,  disability would not have been found.</p><p class="depth0">Example: You were found disabled on the basis of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease. The severity of your impairment was documented  primarily by pulmonary function testing results. The evidence showed  that you could do only light work. Spirometric tracings of this testing,  although required, were not obtained, however. On review, the original  report is resubmitted by the consultative examining physician along with  the corresponding spirometric tracings. A review of the tracings shows  that the test was invalid. Current pulmonary function testing supported  by spirometric tracings reveals that your impairment does not limit your  ability to perform basic work activities in any way. Error is found  based on the fact that required, material evidence which was originally  missing now becomes available and shows that if it had been available at  the time of the prior determination, disability would not have been  found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Substantial evidence which is new evidence which relates to the  prior determination (of allowance or continuance) refutes the  conclusions that were based upon the prior evidence (e.g., a tumor  thought to be malignant was later shown to have actually been benign).  Substantial evidence must show that had the new evidence, (which relates  to the prior determination) been considered at the time of the prior  decision, the claim would not have been allowed or continued. A  substitution of current judgment for that used in the prior favorable  decision will not be the basis for applying this exception.</p><p class="depth0">Example: You were previously found entitled to benefits on the basis  of diabetes mellitus which the prior adjudicator believed was equivalent  to the level of severity contemplated in the Listing of Impairments. The  prior record shows that you had ``brittle'' diabetes for which you were  taking insulin. Your urine was 3+ for sugar, and you alleged occasional  hypoglycemic attacks caused by exertion. On review, symptoms, signs and  laboratory findings are unchanged. The current adjudicator feels,  however, that your impairment clearly does not equal the severity  contemplated by the listings. Error cannot be found because it would  represent a substitution of current judgment for that of the prior  adjudicator that your impairment equaled a listing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The exception for error will not be applied retroactively under  the conditions set out above unless the conditions for reopening the  prior decision (see Secs. 416.1488 through 416.1489) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Second group of exceptions to medical improvement. In addition  to the first group of exceptions to medical improvement, the following  exceptions may result in a determination that you are no longer  disabled. In these situations the decision will be made without a  determination that you have medically improved or can engage in  substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A prior determination or decision was fraudulently obtained. If  we find that any prior favorable determination or decision was obtained  by fraud, we may find that you are not disabled. In addition, we may  reopen your claim under the rules in Sec. 416.1488. In determining  whether a prior favorable determination or decision was fraudulently  obtained, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational,  or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  English language) which you may have had at the time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You do not cooperate with us. If there is a question about  whether you continue to be disabled and we ask you to give us medical or  other evidence or to go for a physical or mental examination by a  certain date, we will find that your disability has ended if you fail,  without good cause, to do what we ask. Section 416.1411 explains the  factors we consider and how we will determine generally whether you have  good cause for failure to cooperate. In addition, Sec. 416.918 discusses  how we determine whether you have good cause for failing to attend a  consultative examination. The month in which your disability ends will  be the first month in which you failed to do what we asked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> We are unable to find you. If there is a question about  whether you continue to be disabled and we are unable to find you to  resolve the question, we will suspend your payments. The month your  payments are suspended will be the first month in which the   question arose and we could not find you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You fail to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected  to restore your ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. If  treatment has been prescribed for you which would be expected to restore  your ability to work, you must follow that treatment in order to be paid  benefits. If you are not following that treatment and you do not have  good cause for failing to follow that treatment, we will find that your  disability has ended (see Sec. 416.930(c)). The month your disability  ends will be the first month in which you failed to follow the  prescribed treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Evaluation steps. To assure that disability reviews are carried  out in a uniform manner, that a decision of continuing disability can be  made in the most expeditious and administratively efficient way, and  that any decisions to stop disability benefits are made objectively,  neutrally, and are fully documented, we will follow specific steps in  reviewing the question of whether your disability continues. Our review  may cease and benefits may be continued at any point if we determine  there is sufficient evidence to find that you are still unable to engage  in substantial gainful activity. The steps are as follows. (See  paragraph (b)(8) of this section if you work during your current period  of eligibility based on disability or during certain other periods.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. Do you have an impairment or combination of impairments  which meets or equals the severity of an impairment listed in appendix 1  of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter? If you do, your disability  will be found to continue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. If you do not, has there been medical improvement as  defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section? If there has been  medical improvement as shown by a decrease in medical severity, see step  3 in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. If there has been no  decrease in medical severity, there has been no medical improvement.  (See step 4 in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3. If there has been medical improvement, we must  determine whether it is related to your ability to do work in accordance  with paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section; i.e.,  whether or not there has been an increase in the residual functional  capacity based on the impairment(s) that was present at the time of the  most recent favorable medical determination. If medical improvement is  not related to your ability to do work, see step 4 in paragraph  (b)(5)(iv) of this section. If medical improvement is related to your  ability to do work, see step 5 in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Step 4. If we found at step 2 in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this  section that there has been no medical improvement or if we found at  step 3 in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section that the medical  improvement is not related to your ability to work, we consider whether  any of the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section  apply. If none of them apply, your disability will be found to continue.  If one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvement applies,  see step 5 in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section. If an exception from  the second group of exceptions to medical improvement applies, your  disability will be found to have ended. The second group of exceptions  to medical improvement may be considered at any point in this process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Step 5. If medical improvement is shown to be related to your  ability to do work or if one of the first group of exceptions to medical  improvement applies, we will determine whether all your current  impairments in combination are severe (see Sec. 416.921). This  determination will consider all your current impairments and the impact  of the combination of these impairments on your ability to function. If  the residual functional capacity assessment in step 3 in paragraph  (b)(5)(iii) of this section shows significant limitation of your ability  to do basic work activities, see step 6 in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this  section. When the evidence shows that all your current impairments in  combination do not significantly limit your physical or mental abilities  to do basic work activities, these impairments will not be considered  severe in nature. If so, you will no longer be considered to be  disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Step 6. If your impairment(s) is severe, we will assess your  current ability to do substantial gainful activity in accordance with  Sec. 416.960. That is, we will assess your residual functional capacity  based on all your current impairments and consider whether you can still  do work you have done in the past. If you can do such work, disability  will be found to have ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Step 7. If you are not able to do work you have done in the  past, we will consider whether you can do other work given the residual  functional capacity assessment made under paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this  section and your age, education, and past work experience (see paragraph  (b)(5)(viii) of this section for an exception to this rule). If you can,  we will find that your disability has ended. If you cannot, we will find  that your disability continues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Step 8. We may proceed to the final step, described in  paragraph (b)(5)(vii) of this section, if the evidence in your file  about your past relevant work is not sufficient for us to make a finding  under paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section about whether you can perform  your past relevant work. If we find that you can adjust to other work  based solely on your age, education, and residual functional capacity,  we will find that you are no longer disabled, and we will not make a  finding about whether you can do your past relevant work under paragraph  (b)(5)(vi) of this section. If we find that you may be unable to adjust  to other work or if Sec. 416.962 may apply, we will assess your claim  under paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section and make a finding about  whether you can perform your past relevant work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The month in which we will find you are no longer disabled. If  the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled, we will find that  your disability ended in the earliest of the following months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The month the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled  under the rules set out in this section, and you were disabled only for  a specified period of time in the past;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The month the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled  under the rules set out in this section, but not earlier than the month  in which we mail you a notice saying that the information we have shows  that you are not disabled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The month in which you return to full-time work, with no  significant medical restrictions and acknowledge that medical  improvement has occurred, and we expected your impairment(s) to improve  (see Sec. 416.991);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of  this section applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The first month you were told by your physician that you could  return to work, provided there is no substantial conflict between your  physician's and your statements regarding your awareness of your  capacity for work and the earlier date is supported by substantial  evidence; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The first month in which you failed without good cause to do  what we asked, when the rule set out in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this  section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Before we stop your benefits. If we find you are no longer  disabled, before we stop your benefits, we will give you a chance to  explain why we should not do so. Subparts M and N of this part describe  your rights and the procedures we will follow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If you work during your current period of eligibility based on  disability or during certain other periods. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> We will not consider the  work you are doing or have done during your current period of  eligibility based on disability (or, when determining whether you are  eligible for expedited reinstatement of benefits under section 1631(p)  of the Act, the work you are doing or have done during or after the  previously terminated period of eligibility referred to in section  1631(p)(1)(B) of the Act) to be past relevant work under paragraph  (b)(5)(vi) of this section or past work experience under paragraph  (b)(5)(vii) of this section. In addition, if you are currently entitled  to disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, we may  or may not consider the physical and mental activities that you perform  in the work you are doing or have done during your current period of  entitlement based on disability, as   explained in paragraphs (b)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you are currently entitled to disability insurance benefits  as a disabled worker, child's insurance benefits based on disability, or  widow's or widower's insurance benefits based on disability under title  II of the Social Security Act, and at the time we are making a  determination on your case you have received such benefits for at least  24 months, we will not consider the activities you perform in the work  you are doing or have done during your current period of entitlement  based on disability if they support a finding that your disability has  ended. (We will use the rules in Sec. 416.990(i)(2) to determine whether  the 24-month requirement is met.) However, we will consider the  activities you do in that work if they support a finding that your  disability continues or they do not conflict with a finding that your  disability continues. We will not presume that you are still disabled if  you stop working.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If you are not a person described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of  this section, we will consider the activities you perform in your work  at any of the evaluation steps in paragraph (b)(5) of this section at  which we need to assess your ability to function. However, we will not  consider the work you are doing or have done during your current period  of eligibility based on disability (or, when determining whether you are  eligible for expedited reinstatement of benefits under section 1631(p)  of the Act, the work you are doing or have done during or after the  previously terminated period of eligibility referred to in section  1631(p)(1)(B) of the Act) to be past relevant work under paragraph  (b)(5)(vi) of this section or past work experience under paragraph  (b)(5)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Persons who were found disabled under a State plan. If you  became entitled to benefits because you were found to be disabled under  a State plan, we will first evaluate your impairment(s) under the rules  explained in paragraph (b) of this section. We will apply the same steps  as described in paragraph (b) of this section to the last decision  granting or affirming entitlement to benefits under the State plan. If  we are not able to find that your disability continues on the basis of  these rules, we will then evaluate your impairment(s) under the  appropriate State plan. If we are not able to find that your disability  continues under these State plan criteria, we will find that your  disability ends. Disability will be found to end the month the evidence  shows that you are no longer disabled under the criteria in paragraph  (b) of this section (or appropriate State plan criteria), subject to the  rules set out in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

There is a  statutory requirement that, if you are eligible for disability benefits  as a disabled child, your continued eligibility for such benefits must  be reviewed periodically. There are a number of factors we consider when  we decide whether your disability continues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We will first consider whether there has been medical  improvement in your impairment(s). We define ``medical improvement'' in  paragraph (c) of this section. If there has been no medical improvement,  we will find you are still disabled unless one of the exceptions in  paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section applies. If there has been medical  improvement, we will consider whether the impairments(s) you had at the  time of our most recent favorable determination or decision now meets or  medically or functionally equals the severity of the listing it met or  equalled at that time. If so, we will find you are still disabled,  unless one of the exceptions in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section  applies. If not, we will consider whether your current impairment(s) are  disabling under the rules in Sec. 416.924. These steps are described in  more detail in paragraph (b) of this section. Even where medical  improvement   or an exception applies, in most cases, we will find that your  disability has ended only if we also find that you are not currently  disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Our determinations and decisions under this section will be made  on a neutral basis, without any initial inference as to the presence or  absence of disability being drawn from the fact that you have been  previously found disabled. We will consider all evidence you submit, as  well as all evidence we obtain from your treating physician(s) and other  medical and nonmedical sources. What constitutes ``evidence'' and our  procedures for obtaining it are set out in Secs. 416.912 through  416.918. Our determination regarding whether your disability continues  will be made on the basis of the weight of the evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sequence of evaluation. To ensure that disability reviews are  carried out in a uniform manner, that decisions of continuing disability  can be made in the most expeditious and administratively efficient way,  and that any decisions to stop disability benefits are made objectively,  neutrally, and are fully documented, we follow specific steps in  determining whether your disability continues. However, we may skip  steps in the sequence if it is clear this would lead to a more prompt  finding that your disability continues. For example, we might not  consider the issue of medical improvement if it is obvious on the face  of the evidence that a current impairment meets the severity of a listed  impairment. If we can make a favorable determination or decision at any  point in the sequence, we do not review further. The steps are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has there been medical improvement in your condition(s)? We will  determine whether there has been medical improvement in the  impairment(s) you had at the time of our most recent favorable  determination or decision. (The term medical improvement is defined in  paragraph (c) of this section.) If there has been no medical  improvement, we will find that your disability continues, unless one of  the exceptions to medical improvement described in paragraph (e) or (f)  of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvement  applies, we will proceed to step 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If one of the second group of exceptions to medical improvement  applies, we may find that your disability has ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Does your impairment(s) still meet or equal the severity of the  listed impairment that it met or equaled before? If there has been  medical improvement, we will consider whether the impairment(s) that we  considered at the time of our most recent favorable determination or  decision still meets or equals the severity of the listed impairment it  met or equaled at that time. In making this decision, we will consider  the current severity of the impairment(s) present and documented at the  time of our most recent favorable determination or decision, and the  same listing section used to make that determination or decision as it  was written at that time, even if it has since been revised or removed  from the Listing of Impairments. If that impairment(s) does not still  meet or equal the severity of that listed impairment, we will proceed to  the next step. If that impairment(s) still meets or equals the severity  of that listed impairment as it was written at that time, we will find  that you are still disabled, unless one of the exceptions to medical  improvement described in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If one of the first group of exceptions to medical improvement  applies, we will proceed to step 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If one of the second group of exceptions to medical improvement  applies, we may find that your disability has ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Are you currently disabled? If there has been medical  improvement in the impairment(s) that we considered at the time of our  most recent favorable determination or decision, and if that  impairment(s) no longer meets or equals the severity of the listed  impairment that it met or equaled at that time, we will consider whether  you are disabled under the rules in Secs. 416.924(c) and (d). In  determining whether you are currently disabled, we will consider all  impairments you now have, including any you did not have at the time of   our most recent favorable determination or decision, or that we did not  consider at that time. The steps in determining current disability are  summarized as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Do you have a severe impairment or combination of impairment? If  there has been medical improvement in your impairment(s), or if one of  the first group of exceptions applies, we will determine whether your  current impairment(s) is severe, as defined in Sec. 416.924(c). If your  impairment(s) is not severe, we will find that your disability has  ended. If your impairment(s) is severe, we will then consider whether it  meets or medically equals the severity of a listed impairment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Does your impairment(s) meet or medically equal the severity of  any impairment listed in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this  chapter? If your current impairment(s) meets or medically equals the  severity of any listed impairment, as described in Secs. 416.925 and  416.926, we will find that your disability continues. If not, we will  consider whether it functionally equals the listings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Does your impairment(s) functionally equal the listings? If  your current impairment(s) functionally equals the listings, as  described in Sec. 416.926a, we will find that your disability continues.  If not, we will find that your disability has ended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What we mean by medical improvement. Medical improvement is any  decrease in the medical severity of your impairment(s) which was present  at the time of the most recent favorable decision that you were disabled  or continued to be disabled. Although the decrease in severity may be of  any quantity or degree, we will disregard minor changes in your signs,  symptoms, and laboratory findings that obviously do not represent  medical improvement and could not result in a finding that your  disability has ended. A determination that there has been a decrease in  medical severity must be based on changes (improvement) in the symptoms,  signs, or laboratory findings associated with your impairment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The most recent favorable decision is the latest final  determination or decision involving a consideration of the medical  evidence and whether you were disabled or continued to be disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The terms symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings are defined  in Sec. 416.928. For children, our definitions of the terms symptoms,  signs, and laboratory findings may include any abnormalities of physical  and mental functioning that we used in making our most recent favorable  decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Some impairments are subject to temporary remissions, which can  give the appearance of medical improvement when in fact there has been  none. If you have the kind of impairment that is subject to temporary  remissions, we will be careful to consider the longitudinal history of  the impairment, including the occurrence of prior remissions and  prospects for future worsenings, when we decide whether there has been  medical improvement. Improvements that are only temporary will not  warrant a finding of medical improvement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior file cannot be located. If we cannot locate your prior  file, we will first determine whether you are currently disabled under  the sequence set forth in Sec. 416.924. (In this way, we will determine  that your benefits continue at the earliest time without reconstructing  prior evidence.) If so, your benefits will continue unless one of the  second group of exceptions applies (see paragraph (f) of this section).  If not, we will determine whether an attempt should be made to  reconstruct those portions of the missing file that were relevant to our  most recent favorable determination or decision (e.g., school records,  medical evidence from treating sources, and the results of consultative  examinations). This determination will consider the potential  availability of old records in light of their age, whether the source of  the evidence is still in operation, and whether reconstruction efforts  will yield a complete record of the basis for the most recent favorable  decision. If relevant parts of the prior record are not reconstructed,  either because we decide not to attempt reconstruction or because our  efforts failed, we will not find that you have medically improved. The  documentation of your current impairment(s) will provide a basis for any  future reviews. If the missing file is later   found, it may serve as a basis for reopening any determination or  decision under this section, in accordance with Sec. 416.1488.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> First group of exceptions to medical improvement. The law  provides certain limited situations when your disability can be found to  have ended even though medical improvement has not occurred, if your  impairment(s) no longer results in marked and severe functional  limitations. These exceptions to medical improvement are intended to  provide a way of finding that a person is no longer disabled in those  situations where, even though there has been no decrease in severity of  the impairment(s), evidence shows that the person should no longer be  considered disabled or never should have been considered disabled. If  one of these exceptions applies, we must also show that your  impairment(s) does not now result in marked and severe functional  limitations, before we can find you are no longer disabled, taking all  your current impairments into account, not just those that existed at  the time of our most recent favorable determination or decision. The  evidence we gather will serve as the basis for the finding that an  exception applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substantial evidence shows that, based on new or improved  diagnostic techniques or evaluations, your impairment(s) is not as  disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent  favorable decision. Changing methodologies and advances in medical and  other diagnostic techniques or evaluations have given rise to, and will  continue to give rise to, improved methods for determining the causes of  (i.e., diagnosing) and measuring and documenting the effects of various  impairments on children and their functioning. Where, by such new or  improved methods, substantial evidence shows that your impairment(s) is  not as severe as was determined at the time of our most recent favorable  decision, such evidence may serve as a basis for a finding that you are  no longer disabled, provided that you do not currently have an  impairment(s) that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the  listings, and therefore results in marked and severe functional  limitations. In order to be used under this exception, however, the new  or improved techniques must have become generally available after the  date of our most recent favorable decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> How we will determine which methods are new or improved  techniques and when they become generally available. New or improved  diagnostic techniques or evaluations will come to our attention by  several methods. In reviewing cases, we often become aware of new  techniques when their results are presented as evidence. Such techniques  and evaluations are also discussed and acknowledged in medical  literature by medical professional groups and other governmental  entities. Through these sources, we develop listings of new techniques  and when they become generally available. For example, we will consult  the Health Care Financing Administration for its experience regarding  when a technique is recognized for payment under Medicare and when they  began paying for the technique.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> How you will know which methods are new or improved techniques  and when they become generally available. We will let you know which  methods we consider to be new or improved techniques and when they  become available through two vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Some of the future changes in the Listing of Impairments in  appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter will be based on new  or improved diagnostic or evaluative techniques. Such listings changes  will clearly state this fact as they are published as Notices of  Proposed Rulemaking and the new or improved technique will be considered  generally available as of the date of the final publication of that  particular listing in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> From time to time, we will publish in the Federal Register  cumulative lists of new or approved diagnostic techniques or evaluations  that have been in use since 1970, how they changed the evaluation of the  applicable impairment and the month and year they became generally  available. We will include any changes in the Listing of Impairments  published in the Code of Federal Regulations since 1970 that are  reflective of new or improved techniques. We will not process any cases  under this exception using a new or improved diagnostic technique   that we have not included in a published notice until we have published  an updated cumulative list. The period between publications will be  determined by the volume of changes needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantial evidence demonstrates that any prior disability  decision was in error. We will apply the exception to medical  improvement based on error if substantial evidence (which may be  evidence on the record at the time any prior determination or decision  of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly  obtained evidence which relates to that determination or decision)  demonstrates that a prior determination or decision (of allowance or  continuance) was in error. A prior determination or decision will be  found in error only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantial evidence shows on its face that the determination or  decision in question should not have been made (e.g., the evidence in  your file, such as pulmonary function study values, was misread, or an  adjudicative standard, such as a listing in appendix 1 of subpart P of  part 404 of this chapter, was misapplied).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the prior evaluation, required and material  evidence of the severity of your impairment(s) was missing. That  evidence becomes available upon review, and substantial evidence  demonstrates that, had such evidence been present at the time of the  prior determination or decision, disability would not have been found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> New substantial evidence that relates to the prior  determination or decision refutes the conclusions that were based upon  the prior evidence at the time of that determination or decision (e.g.,  a tumor thought to be malignant was later shown to have actually been  benign). Substantial evidence must show that, had the new evidence  (which relates to the prior determination or decision) been considered  at the time of the prior determination or decision, the claim would not  have been allowed or continued. A substitution of current judgment for  that used in the prior favorable determination or decision will not be  the basis for applying this exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The exception for error will not be applied retroactively under  the conditions set out above unless the conditions for reopening the  prior decision (see Secs. 416.1488 and 416.1489) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Second group of exceptions to medical improvement. In addition  to the first group of exceptions to medical improvement, the following  exceptions may result in a determination or decision that you are no  longer disabled. In these situations, the determination or decision will  be made without a finding that you have demonstrated medical improvement  or that you are currently not disabled under the rules in Sec. 416.924.  There is no set point in the continuing disability review sequence  described in paragraph (b) of this section at which we must consider  these exceptions; exceptions in the second group may be considered at  any point in the process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A prior determination or decision was fraudulently obtained. If  we find that any prior favorable determination or decision was obtained  by fraud, we may find that you are not disabled. In addition, we may  reopen your claim under the rules in Sec. 416.1488. In determining  whether a prior favorable determination or decision was fraudulently  obtained, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational,  or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the  English language) which you may have had at the time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You do not cooperate with us. If there is a question about  whether you continue to be disabled and we ask you to give us medical or  other evidence or to go for a physical or mental examination by a  certain date, we will find that your disability has ended if you fail,  without good cause, to do what we ask. Section 416.1411 explains the  factors we consider and how we will determine generally whether you have  good cause for failure to cooperate. In addition, Sec. 416.918 discusses  how we determine whether you have good cause for failing to attend a  consultative examination. The month in which your disability ends will  be the first month in which you failed to do what we asked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We are unable to find you. If there is a question about whether  you continue to be disabled and we are unable to find you to resolve the  question, we will suspend your payments. The month your payments are  suspended   will be the first month in which the question arose and we could not  find you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You fail to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected  to improve your impairment(s) so that it no longer results in marked and  severe functional limitations. If treatment has been prescribed for you  which would be expected to improve your impairment(s) so that it no  longer results in marked and severe functional limitations, you must  follow that treatment in order to be paid benefits. If you are not  following that treatment and you do not have good cause for failing to  follow that treatment, we will find that your disability has ended (see  Sec. 416.930(c)). The month your disability ends will be the first month  in which you failed to follow the prescribed treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The month in which we will find you are no longer disabled. If  the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled, we will find that  your disability ended in the following month--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The month the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled  under the rules set out in this section, and you were disabled only for  a specified period of time in the past;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The month the evidence shows that you are no longer disabled  under the rules set out in this section, but not earlier than the month  in which we mail you a notice saying that the information we have shows  that you are not disabled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The month in which you return to, or begin, full-time work with  no significant medical restrictions, and acknowledge that medical  improvement has occurred, and we expected your impairment(s) to improve  (see Sec. 416.991);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of this  section applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The first month in which you were told by your physician that  you could return to normal activities, provided there is no substantial  conflict between your physician's and your statements regarding your  awareness of your capacity, and the earlier date is supported by  substantial evidence; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The first month in which you failed without good cause to do  what we asked, when the rule set out in paragraph (f)(2) of this section  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Before we stop your benefits. If we find you are no longer  disabled, before we stop your benefits, we will give you a chance to  explain why we should not do so. Subparts M and N of this part describe  your rights and the procedures we will follow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requirement for treatment that is medically necessary and  available. If you have a representative payee, the representative payee  must, at the time of the continuing disability review, present evidence  demonstrating that you are and have been receiving treatment, to the  extent considered medically necessary and available, for the  condition(s) that was the basis for providing you with SSI benefits,  unless we determine that requiring your representative payee to provide  such evidence would be inappropriate or unnecessary considering the  nature of your impairment(s). If your representative payee refuses  without good cause to comply with this requirement, and if we decide  that it is in your best interests, we may pay your benefits to another  representative payee or to you directly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What we mean by treatment that is medically necessary. Treatment  that is medically necessary means treatment that is expected to improve  or restore your functioning and that was prescribed by a treating  source, as defined in Sec. 416.902. If you do not have a treating  source, we will decide whether there is treatment that is medically  necessary that could have been prescribed by a treating source. The  treatment may include (but is not limited to)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medical management;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Psychological or psychosocial counseling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Physical therapy; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Home therapy, such as administering oxygen or giving  injections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> How we will consider whether medically necessary treatment is  available. When we decide whether medically necessary treatment is  available, we will consider such things as (but not limited to)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The location of an institution or facility or place where  treatment, services, or resources could be provided to   you in relationship to where you reside;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The availability and cost of transportation for you and your  payee to the place of treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Your general health, including your ability to travel for the  treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The capacity of an institution or facility to accept you for  appropriate treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The cost of any necessary medications or treatments that are not  paid for by Medicaid or another insurer or source; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The availability of local community resources (e.g., clinics,  charitable organizations, public assistance agencies) that would provide  free treatment or funds to cover treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When we will not require evidence of treatment that is medically  necessary and available. We will not require your representative payee  to present evidence that you are and have been receiving treatment if we  find that the condition(s) that was the basis for providing you benefits  is not amenable to treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Removal of a payee who does not provide evidence that a child is  and has been receiving treatment that is medically necessary and  available. If your representative payee refuses without good cause to  provide evidence that you are and have been receiving treatment that is  medically necessary and available, we may, if it is in your best  interests, suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and  pay benefits to another payee or to you. When we decide whether your  representative payee had good cause, we will consider factors such as  the acceptable reasons for failure to follow prescribed treatment in  Sec. 416.930(c) and other factors similar to those describing good cause  for missing deadlines in Sec. 416.1411.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If you do not have a representative payee. If you do not have a  representative payee and we make your payments directly to you, the  provisions of this paragraph do not apply to you. However, we may still  decide that you are failing to follow prescribed treatment under the  provisions of Sec. 416.930, if the requirements of that section are met.
