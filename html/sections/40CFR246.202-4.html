All of the  following suggested modes of separation and storage presuppose that the  corrugated boxes will be accumulated at a central location in the  facility after their contents are removed and that the boxes are  flattened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Balers of various sizes: Corrugated boxes are placed in balers  and compacted into bales. These bales may be stored inside or outside of  the facility. The bales should be protected from fire, inclement  weather, theft, and vandalism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stationary compactors or bulk containers: Corrugated boxes are  placed in a stationary compactor or bulk containers outside of the  facility. The containers should be protected from fire, inclement  weather, theft and vandalism.</p>
