                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NOI. The NOI initiates the formal scoping process and is  prepared by the proponent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to preparing an EIS, an NOI will be published in the FR  and in newspapers with appropriate or general circulation in the areas  potentially affected by the proposed action. The OCLL will be notified  by the ARSTAF proponent of pending EISs so that congressional  coordination may be effected. After the NOI is published in the FR,  copies of the notice may also be distributed to agencies, organizations,  and individuals, as the responsible official deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NOI transmittal package includes the NOI, the press release,  information for Members of Congress, memorandum for correspondents, and  a ``questions and answers'' (Q&A;) package. The NOI shall clearly state  the proposed action and alternatives, and state why the action may have  unknown and/or significant environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proponent forwards the NOI and the transmittal package to  the appropriate HQDA (ARSTAF) proponent for coordination and staffing  prior to publication. The ARSTAF proponent will coordinate the NOI with  HQDA (ODEP), OCLL, TJAG, OGC, OCPA, relevant MACOMs, and others). Only  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety, and  Occupational Health (DASA(ESOH)) can authorize release of an NOI to the  FR for publication, unless that authority has been delegated. A cover  letter (similar to Figure 5 in Sec. 651.46) will accompany the NOI. An  example NOI is shown in Figure 6 in Sec. 651.46.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lead and cooperating agency determination. As soon as possible  after the decision is made to prepare an EIS, the proponent will contact  appropriate federal, tribal, state, and local agencies to identify lead  or cooperating agency responsibilities concerning EIS preparation. At  this point, a public affairs plan must be developed. In the case of  State ARNG actions that have federal funding, the NGB will be the lead  agency for the purpose of federal compliance with NEPA. The State may be  either a   joint lead or a cooperating agency, as determined by NGB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scoping. The proponent will begin the scoping process described  in Sec. 651.48. Portions of the scoping process may take place prior to  publication of the NOI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DEIS preparation and processing. Prior to publication of a DEIS,  the proponent can prepare a PDEIS, allowing for internal organization  and the resolution of internal Army consideration, prior to a formal  request for comments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PDEIS. Based on information obtained and decisions made during  the scoping process, the proponent may prepare the PDEIS. To expedite  headquarters review, a summary document is also required to present the  purpose and need for the action, DOPAA, major issues, unresolved issues,  major potential controversies, and required mitigations or monitoring.  This summary will be forwarded, through the chain of command, to ODEP,  the DASA(ESOH), and other interested offices for review and comment. If  requested by these offices, a draft PDEIS can be provided following  review of the summary. The PDEIS is not normally made available to the  public and should be stamped ``For Internal Use Only-Deliberative  Process.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DEIS. The Army proponent will advise the DEIS preparer of the  number of copies to be forwarded for final HQDA review and those for  filing with the EPA. Distribution may include interested congressional  delegations and committees, governors, national environmental  organizations, the DOD and federal agency headquarters, and other  selected entities. The Army proponent will finalize the FR NOA, the  proposed news release, and the EPA filing letter for signature of the  DASA(ESOH). A revised process summary of the contents (purpose and need  for the action, DOPAA, major issues, unresolved issues, major potential  controversies, and required mitigations or monitoring) will accompany  the DEIS to HQDA for review and comment. If the action has been  delegated by the ASA(I&E;), only the process summary is required, unless  the DEIS is requested by HQDA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the DEIS has been formally approved, the preparer can  distribute the DEIS to the remainder of the distribution list. The DEIS  must be distributed prior to, or simultaneously with, filing with EPA.  The list includes federal, state, regional, and local agencies, private  citizens, and local organizations. The EPA will publish the NOA in the  FR. The 45-day comment period begins on the date of the EPA notice in  the FR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Following approval, the proponent will forward five copies of  the DEIS to EPA for filing and notice in the FR; publication of EPA's  NWR commences the public comment period. The proponent will distribute  the DEIS prior to, or simultaneously with, filing with EPA. Distribution  will include appropriate federal, state, regional, and local agencies;  Native American tribes; and organizations and private citizens who have  expressed interest in the proposed action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For proposed actions that are environmentally controversial,  or of national interest, the OCLL shall be notified of the pending  action so that appropriate congressional coordination may be effected.  The OCPA will coordinate public announcements through its chain of  command. Proponents will ensure that the DEIS and subsequent NEPA  documents are provided in electronic format to allow for maximum  information flow throughout the process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public review of DEIS. The DEIS public comment period will be no  less than 45 days. If the statement is unusually long, a summary of the  DEIS may be circulated, with an attached list of locations where the  entire DEIS may be reviewed (for example, local public libraries).  Distribution of the complete DEIS should be accompanied by the  announcement of availability in established newspapers of major  circulation, and must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special  expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved and any  appropriate federal, state, or local agency authorized to develop and  enforce environmental standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant, if the proposed action involves any application  of proposal for the use of Army resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any person, organization, or agency requesting the entire DEIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any Indian tribes, Native Alaskan organizations, or Native  Hawaiian organizations potentially impacted by the proposed action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Chairs/co-chairs of any existing citizen advisory groups (for  example, Restoration Advisory Boards).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Public meetings or hearings. Public meetings or hearings on the  DEIS will be held in accordance with the criteria established in 40 CFR  1506.6(c) and (d) or for any other reason the proponent deems  appropriate. News releases should be prepared and issued to publicize  the meetings or hearings at least 15 days prior to the meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Response to comments. Comments will be incorporated in the DEIS  by modification of the text and/or written explanation. Where possible,  similar comments will be grouped for a common response. The preparer or  a higher authority may make individual response, if considered  desirable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The FEIS. If the changes to the DEIS are exclusively  clarifications or minor factual corrections, a document consisting of  only the DEIS comments, responses to the comments, and errata sheets may  be prepared and circulated. If such an abbreviated FEIS is anticipated,  the DEIS should contain a statement advising reviewers to keep the  document so they will have a complete set of ``final'' documents. The  final EIS to be filed with EPA will consist of a complete document  containing a new cover sheet, the errata sheets, comments and responses,  and the text of the draft EIS. Coordination, approval, filing, and  public notice of an abbreviated FEIS are the same as for a draft DEIS.  If extensive modifications are warranted, the proponent will prepare a  new, complete FEIS. Preparation, coordination, approval, filing, and  public notice of the FEIS are the same as the process outlined for the  DEIS. The FEIS distribution must include any person, organization, or  agency that submitted substantive comments on the DEIS. One copy  (electronic) of the FEIS will be forwarded to ODEP. The FEIS will  clearly identify the Army's preferred alternative unless prohibited by  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Decision. No decision will be made on a proposed action until 30  days after EPA has published the NWR of the FEIS in the FR, or 90 days  after the NWR of the DEIS, whichever is later. EPA publishes NWRs  weekly. Those NWRs ready for EPA by close of business Friday are  published in the next Friday's issue of the FR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> ROD. The ROD documents the decision made and the basis for that  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proponent will prepare a ROD for the decision maker's  signature, which will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Clearly state the decision by describing it in sufficient detail  to address the significant issues and ensure necessary long-term  monitoring and execution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify all alternatives considered by the Army in reaching  its decision, specifying the environmentally preferred alternative(s).  The Army will discuss preferences among alternatives based on relevant  factors including environmental, economic, and technical considerations  and agency statutory missions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify and discuss all such factors, including any essential  considerations of national policy that were balanced by the Army in  making its decision. Because economic and technical analyses are  balanced with environmental analysis, the agency preferred alternative  will not necessarily be the environmentally preferred alternative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Discuss how those considerations entered into the final  decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize  environmental harm from the selected alternative have been adopted, and  if not, why they were not.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Identify or incorporate by reference the mitigation measures  that were incorporated into the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Implementation of the decision may begin immediately after  approval of the ROD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proponent will prepare an NOA to be published in the FR by  the HQDA proponent, following congressional notification. Processing and  approval of the NOA is the same as for an NOI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> RODs will be distributed to agencies with authority or oversight  over aspects of the proposal, cooperating agencies, appropriate  congressional, state, and district offices, all parties that are  directly affected, and others upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> One electronic copy of the ROD will be forwarded to ODEP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A monitoring and enforcement program will be adopted and  summarized for any mitigation (see Appendix C of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Pre-decision referrals. 40 CFR part 1504 specifies procedures to  resolve federal agency disagreements on the environmental effects of a  proposed action. Pre-decision referrals apply to interagency  disagreement on a proposed action's potential unsatisfactory effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Changes during preparation. If there are substantial changes in  the proposed action, or significant new information relevant to  environmental concerns during the proposed action's planning process,  the proponent will prepare revisions or a supplement to any  environmental document or prepare new documentation as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Mitigation. All measures planned to minimize or mitigate  expected significant environmental impacts will be identified in the EIS  and the ROD. Implementation of the mitigation plan is the responsibility  of the proponent (see Appendix C of this part). The proponent will make  available to the public, upon request, the status and results of  mitigation measures associated with the proposed action. For weapon  system acquisition programs, the proponent will coordinate with the  appropriate responsible parties before identifying potential mitigations  in the EIS/ROD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Implementing the decision. The proponent will provide for  monitoring to assure that decisions are carried out, particularly in  controversial cases or environmentally sensitive areas (Appendix C of  this part). Mitigation and other conditions that have been identified in  the EIS, or during its review and comment period, and made part of the  decision (and ROD), will be implemented by the lead agency or other  appropriate consenting agency. The proponent will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include appropriate conditions in grants, permits, or other  approvals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that the proponent's project budget includes provisions  for mitigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon request, inform cooperating or commenting agencies on the  progress in carrying out adopted mitigation measures that they have  proposed and that were adopted by the agency making the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon request, make the results of relevant monitoring available  to the public and Congress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Make results of relevant monitoring available to citizens  advisory groups, and others that expressed such interest during the EIS  process.</p>
