                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ROTC draws young men and women from all geographic areas and all strata of our country. It uses the many educational disciplines required for the modern Army. The ROTC ensures that men and women educated in a variety of American schools of higher learning are commissioned annually in the Army officer corps. In the future, the ROTC will continue to be the major source of newly commissioned officers for the Active Army, both Regular Army and Reserve forces. In addition, ROTC provides an advantage both to the Army and institutions of higher learning by assisting in the education of future Army Officers and providing a communication link between our military leaders and our developing students.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Army Senior ROTC program is a cooperative effort, contracted between the Army and host institution to provide junior officer leadership in the interest of national security. The Army maintains a cordial and cooperative relationship with host institutions. The Army's goal is to continue to develop well-educated young men and women with potential as leaders in both civilian enterprise and national defense. The Army is receptive to valid criticism, regardless of source, as a means of maintaining a workable program. The right of orderly campus dissent is recognized. However, anti-ROTC activities which degrade and distort the Army image cannot be ignored. Consequently, the Army must look to its institutional hosts to provide campus support for the ROTC program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The program meets changing educational philosophies and concepts. It gives a flexible course of study in the changing environment of the academic community. A curriculum in the ROTC program is not restricted to classroom teaching. Program objectives may be satisfied in a variety of ways. A program may include a curriculum of other than classroom instruction if: it provides stated learning results, it is adopted by the host institution as part of its curriculum, and it follows the program of instruction published by the US Army Training and Doctrine Command. The PMS has authority, subject to limits set by the region commander, to develop courses that accomplish program objectives of the host institution. Activities which are part of the host school's curriculum require the same degree of support as other elements of the curriculum. The goal of the ROTC program is to commission well-educated young men and women in the Army.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The PMS is responsible to see that each cadet realizes the importance of choice of branch preferences and what is involved in making an intelligent selection. Each graduating cadet by Army policy is assigned to the branch indicated by personal preference, academic major, physical qualifications, ROTC training, and demonstrated abilities, whenever possible. However, the assignment must be made by the needs of the service and may

prevent selection based on the other factors. In assigning branches consideration is given to the cadet's academic specialization.</p>
