After response by the applicant, the examining attorney will review all statutory refusals and/or requirement(s) in light of the response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, after review of the applicant's response, the examining attorney issues a non-final action that maintains any previously issued substantive refusal(s) to register or repeats any requirement(s), the applicant may submit a timely response to the action under Sec.  2.62(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, after review of the applicant's response, the examining attorney issues a non-final action that contains no substantive refusals to register, but maintains any requirement(s), the applicant may respond to such repeated requirement(s) by filing a timely petition to the Director for relief from the repeated requirement(s) if the subject matter of the repeated requirement(s) is appropriate for petition to the Director (see Sec.  2.146(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final refusal or requirement. Upon review of a response, the examining attorney may state that the refusal(s) to register, or the requirement(s), is final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the examining attorney issues a final action that maintains any substantive refusal(s) to register, the applicant may respond by timely filing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A request for reconsideration under paragraph (b)(3) of this section that seeks to overcome any substantive refusal(s) to register, and comply with any outstanding requirement(s), maintained in the final action; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board under Sec.
