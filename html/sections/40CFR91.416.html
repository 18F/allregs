                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If used, the engine intake air flow measurement method used must have a range large enough to accurately measure the air flow over the engine operating range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy must be [2 percent of full-scale value of the measurement device for all modes except the idle mode. For the idle mode, the measurement accuracy shall be [5 percent or less of the full-scale value. The Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an engine system incorporates devices that affect the air flow measurement (such as air bleeds, air injection, pulsed air, and so forth) that result in understated exhaust emission results, make corrections to the exhaust emission results to account for such effects.</p>
