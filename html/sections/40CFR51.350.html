                            <p class="depth0">Inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs are required in both ozone and  carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas, depending upon population and  nonattainment classification or design value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nonattainment area classification and population criteria. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  States or areas within an ozone transport region shall implement  enhanced I/M programs in any metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or  portion of an MSA, within the State or area with a 1990 population of  100,000 or more as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  regardless of the area's attainment classification. In the case of a  multi-state MSA, enhanced I/M shall be implemented in all ozone  transport region portions if the sum of these portions has a population  of 100,000 or more, irrespective of the population of the portion in the  individual ozone transport region State or area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apart from those areas described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, any area classified as serious or worse ozone nonattainment, or  as moderate or serious CO nonattainment with a design value greater than  12.7 ppm, and having a 1980 Bureau of Census-defined (Census-defined)  urbanized area population of 200,000 or more, shall implement enhanced  I/M in the 1990 Census-defined urbanized area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any area classified, as of November 5, 1992, as marginal ozone  nonattainment or moderate CO nonattainment with a design value of 12.7  ppm or less shall continue operating I/M programs that were part of an  approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) as of November 15, 1990, and  shall update those programs as necessary to meet the basic I/M program  requirements of this subpart. Any such area required by the Clean Air  Act, as in effect prior to November 15, 1990, as interpreted in EPA  guidance, to have an I/M program shall also implement a basic I/M  program. Serious, severe and extreme ozone areas and CO areas over 12.7  ppm shall also continue operating existing I/M programs and shall  upgrade such programs, as appropriate, pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any area classified as moderate ozone nonattainment, and not  required to implement enhanced I/M under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, shall implement basic I/M in any 1990 Census-defined urbanized  area with a population of 200,000 or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the boundaries of a moderate ozone nonattainment area are  changed pursuant to section 107(d)(4)(A)(i)-(ii) of the Clean Air Act,  such that the area includes additional urbanized areas with a population  of 200,000 or more, then a basic I/M program shall be implemented in  these additional urbanized areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the boundaries of a serious or worse ozone nonattainment area  or of a moderate or serious CO nonattainment area with a design value  greater than 12.7 ppm are changed any time after enactment pursuant to  section 107(d)(4)(A) such that the area includes additional urbanized  areas, then an enhanced I/M program shall be implemented in the newly  included 1990 Census-defined urbanized areas, if the 1980 Census-defined  urban area population is 200,000 or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If a marginal ozone nonattainment area, not required to  implement   enhanced I/M under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is reclassified to  moderate, a basic I/M program shall be implemented in the 1990 Census- defined urbanized area(s) with a population of 200,000 or more. If the  area is reclassified to serious or worse, an enhanced I/M program shall  be implemented in the 1990 Census-defined urbanized area, if the 1980  Census-defined urban area population is 200,000 or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If a moderate ozone or CO nonattainment area is reclassified to  serious or worse, an enhanced I/M program shall be implemented in the  1990 Census-defined urbanized area, if the 1980 Census-defined  population is 200,000 or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extent of area coverage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an ozone transport region, the  program shall cover all counties within subject MSAs or subject portions  of MSAs, as defined by OMB in 1990, except largely rural counties having  a population density of less than 200 persons per square mile based on  the 1990 Census and counties with less than 1% of the population in the  MSA may be excluded provided that at least 50% of the MSA population is  included in the program. This provision does not preclude the voluntary  inclusion of portions of an excluded county. Non-urbanized islands not  connected to the mainland by roads, bridges, or tunnels may be excluded  without regard to population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Outside of ozone transport regions, programs shall nominally  cover at least the entire urbanized area, based on the 1990 census.  Exclusion of some urban population is allowed as long as an equal number  of non-urban residents of the MSA containing the subject urbanized area  are included to compensate for the exclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Emission reduction benefits from expanding coverage beyond the  minimum required urban area boundaries can be applied toward the  reasonable further progress requirements or can be used for offsets,  provided the covered vehicles are operated in the nonattainment area,  but not toward the enhanced I/M performance standard requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In a multi-state urbanized area with a population of 200,000 or  more that is required under paragraph (a) of this section to implement  I/M, any State with a portion of the area having a 1990 Census-defined  population of 50,000 or more shall implement an I/M program. The other  coverage requirements in paragraph (b) of this section shall apply in  multi-state areas as well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding the limitation in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, in an ozone transport region, States which opt for a program  which meets the performance standard described in Sec. 51.351(h) and  claim in their SIP less emission reduction credit than the basic  performance standard for one or more pollutants, may apply a geographic  bubble covering areas in the State not otherwise subject to an I/M  requirement to achieve emission reductions from other measures equal to  or greater than what would have been achieved if the low enhanced  performance standard were met in the subject I/M areas. Emissions  reductions from non-I/M measures shall not be counted towards the OTR  low enhanced performance standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements after attainment. All I/M programs shall provide  that the program will remain effective, even if the area is redesignated  to attainment status or the standard is otherwise rendered no longer  applicable, until the State submits and EPA approves a SIP revision  which convincingly demonstrates that the area can maintain the relevant  standard(s) without benefit of the emission reductions attributable to  the I/M program. The State shall commit to fully implement and enforce  the program until such a demonstration can be made and approved by EPA.  At a minimum, for the purposes of SIP approval, legislation authorizing  the program shall not sunset prior to the attainment deadline for the  applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SIP requirements. The SIP shall describe the applicable areas in  detail and, consistent with Sec. 51.372 of this subpart, shall include  the legal authority or rules necessary to establish program boundaries.
