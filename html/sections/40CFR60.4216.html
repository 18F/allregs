Sec. 60.4202 and 60.4205, and not those for non-emergency engines in Sec. 60.4201 and Sec. 60.4204, except that for 2014 model year and later non-emergency CI ICE, the owner or operator of any such engine that was not certified as meeting Tier 4 PM standards, must meet the applicable requirements for PM in Sec. Sec. 60.4201 and 60.4204 or install a PM emission control device that achieves PM emission reductions of 85 percent, or 60 percent for engines with a displacement of greater than or equal to 30 liters per cylinder, compared to engine-out emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of Sec. 60.4207 do not apply to owners and operators of pre-2014 model year stationary CI ICE subject to this subpart that are located in
