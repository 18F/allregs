                                Sec. 226.20  How is the royalty on gas calculated?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All gas removed from the lease from which it is produced must be metered before removal unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent and be subject to a royalty of not less than 20 percent of the gross proceeds of the gas. Unless the Osage Minerals Council, with approval of the Superintendent, elects to take the royalty in kind, gross proceeds must be calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; except that the Superintendent may direct (and the Osage Minerals Council may request that the Superintendent direct) any lessee, upon no less than 30 calendar days notice, to calculate gross proceeds at the higher royalty value of paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under this paragraph, gross proceeds of the gas must be determined by multiplying the measured volume of gas at the well (Mcf), times the heating volume of the gas (MMBtu/Mcf), times the index price of the gas ($/MMBtu) for Oklahoma Zone 1 published by the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue. If that Monthly Index Price ceases to be published and/or is not otherwise available, the price must be calculated in a comparable manner to be determined by the Superintendent. The heating value of the gas shall be calculated in accordance with American Petroleum Institute MPMS Chapter 14, Section 5, and shall be reported under the following conditions: Dry (no water vapor), real, gross, and adjusted pressure of 14.73 psi and a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. If any lessee supplies gas produced from one lease for operation and/or development of any other lease, including another lease held by the same lessee, the royalty calculated under this section must be paid on all gas so used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under this paragraph, gross proceeds of the gas will be 100 percent of the actual proceeds from sales of all residue gas produced from the lease and one hundred percent of the actual proceeds from sales of all natural gas liquids produced from the lease minus the actual, reasonable cost of processing not to exceed 50 percent of the actual sales value of the natural gas liquids (including drip condensate). If the actual reasonable cost of processing cannot be obtained, upon approval by the Superintendent, the lessee may determine such cost in accordance with the alternative methodology and procedures in 30 CFR 1206.180(a) or (b). No other deductions of any kind, whether monetary or volumetric or otherwise, for any purpose, including but not limited to compression, dehydration, gathering, treating, or transportation are allowed.</p>
