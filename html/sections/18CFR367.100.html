There must not be included in the group of accounts designated as current and accrued assets any item, the amount or collectibility of which is not reasonably assured, unless an adequate provision for the related possible loss has been made. Items of current character but of doubtful value may be written down and for record purposes carried in these accounts at nominal value.</p>
