                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the United States Agency for International Development (hereinafter ``USAID'' or ``the Agency'') that information about its objectives and operations be freely available to the public in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended; the President's Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies regarding the FOIA, 29 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1999 (October 4, 1993); and the Attorney General's Memorandum of the same title and date. The Director, Office of Administrative Services, Bureau for Management, or his/her designee, is responsible on behalf of the Agency for administration of the provisions of the regulations set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, concerning the International Cooperation and Development Agency (``IDCA''), pursuant to executive order and delegations of authority USAID is responsible not only for management of its own affairs but also for those of IDCA. The policy of IDCA in the FOIA area has been determined by USAID to be identical to that of USAID, as stated in this section. Therefore, all policies and procedures set forth in this part apply equally to IDCA as to USAID; and it is intended that references in this part to ``USAID'' or ``the Agency'' shall, wherever appropriate, include or mean a reference to IDCA. Accordingly, all IDCA FOIA-related matters shall be referred to and processed by USAID staff under this part as though they were USAID matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All records of USAID shall be made available to the public upon compliance with the procedures established in Sec. 212.33, except to the extent a determination is made to withhold a record exemptible under 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Such a determination shall be made pursuant to procedures set forth in Sec. 212.36, 212.37 and 212.38.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term ``record'' as used in this part includes all books, papers, maps, photographs, or other documentary material or copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made in or received by USAID (including its missions or offices abroad), and preserved as evidence of its organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities. The term does not include copies of the records of other U.S. Government agencies, foreign governments, international organizations, or non-governmental entities which do not evidence organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or activities of USAID.</p>
