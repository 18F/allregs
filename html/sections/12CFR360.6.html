                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial asset means cash or a contract or instrument that  conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another  financial instrument from another entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Investor means a person or entity that owns an obligation issued  by an issuing entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Issuing entity means an entity that owns a financial asset or  financial assets transferred by the sponsor and issues obligations  supported by such asset or assets. Issuing entities may include, but are  not limited to, corporations, partnerships, trusts, and limited  liability companies and are commonly referred to as special purpose  vehicles or special purpose entities. To the extent a securitization is  structured as a multi-step transfer, the term issuing entity would  include both the issuer of the obligations and any intermediate entities  that may be a transferee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Specified GSE  or an entity established or guaranteed by a Specified GSE shall not  constitute an issuing entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monetary default means a default in the payment of principal or  interest when due following the expiration of any cure period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Obligation means a debt or equity (or mixed) beneficial interest  or security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of one or more  financial assets or financial asset pools, either fixed or revolving,  that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period, or  upon the disposition of the underlying financial assets, and by any  rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely  distributions of proceeds to the security holders issued by an issuing  entity. The term may include beneficial interests in a grantor trust,  common law trust or similar issuing entity to the extent that such  interests satisfy the criteria set forth in the preceding sentence, but  does not include LLC interests, partnership interests, common or  preferred equity, or similar instruments evidencing ownership of the  issuing entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Participation means the transfer or assignment of an undivided  interest in all or part of a financial asset, that has all of the  characteristics of a ``participating interest,'' from a seller, known as  the ``lead,'' to a buyer, known as the ``participant,'' without recourse  to the lead, pursuant to an agreement between the lead and the  participant. ``Without recourse'' means that the participation is not  subject to any agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the  participant's interest or to otherwise compensate the participant upon  the borrower's default on the underlying obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Securitization means the issuance by an issuing entity of  obligations for which the investors are relying on the cash flow or  market value characteristics and the credit quality of transferred  financial assets (together with any external credit support permitted by  this section) to repay the obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Servicer means any entity responsible for the management or  collection of some or all of the financial assets on behalf of the  issuing entity or making allocations or distributions to holders of the  obligations, including reporting on the overall cash flow and credit  characteristics of the financial assets supporting the securitization to  enable the issuing entity to make payments to investors on the  obligations. The term ``servicer'' does not include a trustee for the  issuing entity or the holders of obligations that makes allocations or  distributions to holders of the obligations if the trustee receives such  allocations or distributions from a servicer and the trustee does not  otherwise perform the functions of a servicer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Specified GSE means each of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Federal National Mortgage Association and any affiliate  thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and any affiliate  thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Government National Mortgage Association; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any federal or state sponsored mortgage finance agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Sponsor means a person or entity that organizes and initiates a  securitization by transferring financial assets, either directly or  indirectly, including through an affiliate, to an issuing entity,  whether or not such person owns an interest in the issuing entity or  owns any of the obligations issued by the issuing entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Transfer means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The conveyance of a financial asset or financial assets to an  issuing entity or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The creation of a security interest in such asset or assets for  the benefit of the issuing entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coverage. This section shall apply to securitizations that meet  the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Capital Structure and Financial Assets. The documents creating  the securitization must define the payment structure and capital  structure of the transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements applicable to all securitizations:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The securitization shall not consist of re-securitizations of  obligations or collateralized debt obligations unless the documents  creating the securitization require that disclosures required in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made available to investors for the  underlying assets supporting the securitization at initiation and while  obligations are outstanding; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The documents creating the securitization shall require that  payment of principal and interest on the   securitization obligation must be primarily based on the performance of  financial assets that are transferred to the issuing entity and, except  for interest rate or currency mismatches between the financial assets  and the obligations, shall not be contingent on market or credit events  that are independent of such financial assets. The securitization may  not be an unfunded securitization or a synthetic transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the  financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The capital structure of the securitization shall be limited to  no more than six credit tranches and cannot include ``sub-tranches,''  grantor trusts or other structures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  most senior credit tranche may include time-based sequential pay or  planned amortization and companion sub-tranches; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The credit quality of the obligations cannot be enhanced at the  issuing entity or pool level through external credit support or  guarantees. However, the credit quality of the obligations may be  enhanced by credit support or guarantees provided by Specified GSEs and  the temporary payment of principal and/or interest may be supported by  liquidity facilities, including facilities designed to permit the  temporary payment of interest following appointment of the FDIC as  conservator or receiver. Individual financial assets transferred into a  securitization may be guaranteed, insured or otherwise benefit from  credit support at the loan level through mortgage and similar insurance  or guarantees, including by private companies, agencies or other  governmental entities, or government-sponsored enterprises, and/or  through co-signers or other guarantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements applicable to all securitizations:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The documents shall require that, on or prior to issuance of  obligations and at the time of delivery of any periodic distribution  report and, in any event, at least once per calendar quarter, while  obligations are outstanding, information about the obligations and the  securitized financial assets shall be disclosed to all potential  investors at the financial asset or pool level, as appropriate for the  financial assets, and security-level to enable evaluation and analysis  of the credit risk and performance of the obligations and financial  assets. The documents shall require that such information and its  disclosure, at a minimum, shall comply with the requirements of  Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation AB, 17 CFR 229.1100  through 1123 (to the extent then in effect) or any successor disclosure  requirements for public issuances, even if the obligations are issued in  a private placement or are not otherwise required to be registered.  Information that is unknown or not available to the sponsor or the  issuer after reasonable investigation may be omitted if the issuer  includes a statement in the offering documents disclosing that the  specific information is otherwise unavailable;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The documents shall require that, on or prior to issuance of  obligations, the structure of the securitization and the credit and  payment performance of the obligations shall be disclosed, including the  capital or tranche structure, the priority of payments and specific  subordination features; representations and warranties made with respect  to the financial assets, the remedies for and the time permitted for  cure of any breach of representations and warranties, including the  repurchase of financial assets, if applicable; liquidity facilities and  any credit enhancements permitted by this rule, any waterfall triggers  or priority of payment reversal features; and policies governing  delinquencies, servicer advances, loss mitigation, and write-offs of  financial assets;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The documents shall require that while obligations are  outstanding, the issuing entity shall provide to investors information  with respect to the   credit performance of the obligations and the financial assets,  including periodic and cumulative financial asset performance data,  delinquency and modification data for the financial assets,  substitutions and removal of financial assets, servicer advances, as  well as losses that were allocated to such tranche and remaining balance  of financial assets supporting such tranche, if applicable, and the  percentage of each tranche in relation to the securitization as a whole;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In connection with the issuance of obligations, the documents  shall require that the nature and amount of compensation paid to the  originator, sponsor, rating agency or third-party advisor, any mortgage  or other broker, and the servicer(s), and the extent to which any risk  of loss on the underlying assets is retained by any of them for such  securitization be disclosed. The securitization documents shall require  the issuer to provide to investors while obligations are outstanding any  changes to such information and the amount and nature of payments of any  deferred compensation or similar arrangements to any of the parties.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the  financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Prior to issuance of obligations, sponsors shall disclose loan  level information about the financial assets including, but not limited  to, loan type, loan structure (for example, fixed or adjustable, resets,  interest rate caps, balloon payments, etc.), maturity, interest rate  and/or Annual Percentage Rate, and location of property; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Prior to issuance of obligations, sponsors shall affirm  compliance in all material respects with applicable statutory and  regulatory standards for origination of mortgage loans, including that  the mortgages are underwritten at the fully indexed rate relying on  documented income, and comply with supervisory guidance governing the  underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency  Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the  Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and  such other or additional guidance applicable at the time of loan  origination. Sponsors shall disclose a third party due diligence report  on compliance with such standards and the representations and warranties  made with respect to the financial assets; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The documents shall require that prior to issuance of  obligations and while obligations are outstanding, servicers shall  disclose any ownership interest by the servicer or an affiliate of the  servicer in other whole loans secured by the same real property that  secures a loan included in the financial asset pool. The ownership of an  obligation, as defined in this regulation, shall not constitute an  ownership interest requiring disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section and use as appropriate any available  standardized documentation for each different asset class.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements applicable to all securitizations. The documents  shall define the contractual rights and responsibilities of the parties,  including but not limited to representations and warranties and ongoing  disclosure requirements, and any measures to avoid conflicts of  interest; and provide authority for the parties, including but not  limited to the originator, sponsor, servicer, and investors, to fulfill  their respective duties and exercise their rights under the contracts  and clearly distinguish between any multiple roles performed by any  party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the  financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Servicing and other agreements must provide servicers with  authority, subject to contractual oversight by any master servicer or  oversight advisor, if any, to mitigate losses on financial assets  consistent with maximizing the net present value of the financial asset.  Servicers shall have the authority to modify assets to address  reasonably foreseeable default, and to take other action to maximize the  value and minimize losses on the securitized financial   assets. The documents shall require that the servicers apply industry  best practices for asset management and servicing. The documents shall  require the servicer to act for the benefit of all investors, and not  for the benefit of any particular class of investors, that the servicer  must commence action to mitigate losses no later than ninety (90) days  after an asset first becomes delinquent unless all delinquencies on such  asset have been cured, and that the servicer maintains records of its  actions to permit full review by the trustee or other representative of  the investors; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The servicing agreement shall not require a primary servicer to  advance delinquent payments of principal and interest for more than  three payment periods, unless financing or reimbursement facilities are  available, which may include, but are not limited to, the obligations of  the master servicer or issuing entity to fund or reimburse the primary  servicer, or alternative reimbursement facilities. Such ``financing or  reimbursement facilities'' under this paragraph shall not be dependent  for repayment on foreclosure proceeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compensation. The following requirements apply only to  securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential  mortgage loans. Compensation to parties involved in the securitization  of such financial assets must be structured to provide incentives for  sustainable credit and the long-term performance of the financial assets  and securitization as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The documents shall require that any fees or other compensation  for services payable to credit rating agencies or similar third-party  evaluation companies shall be payable, in part, over the five (5) year  period after the first issuance of the obligations based on the  performance of surveillance services and the performance of the  financial assets, with no more than sixty (60) percent of the total  estimated compensation due at closing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The documents shall provide that compensation to servicers  shall include incentives for servicing, including payment for loan  restructuring or other loss mitigation activities, which maximizes the  net present value of the financial assets. Such incentives may include  payments for specific services, and actual expenses, to maximize the net  present value or a structure of incentive fees to maximize the net  present value, or any combination of the foregoing that provides such  incentives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Origination and retention requirements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements  applicable to all securitizations. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Prior to the effective date of  regulations required under new Section 15G of the Securities Exchange  Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the documents shall  require that the sponsor retain an economic interest in a material  portion, defined as not less than five (5) percent, of the credit risk  of the financial assets. This retained interest may be either in the  form of an interest of not less than five (5) percent in each of the  credit tranches sold or transferred to the investors or in a  representative sample of the securitized financial assets equal to not  less than five (5) percent of the principal amount of the financial  assets at transfer. This retained interest may not be sold or pledged or  hedged, except for the hedging of interest rate or currency risk, during  the term of the securitization.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Upon the effective date of regulations required under new  Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., added  by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act, such final regulations shall exclusively govern the  requirement to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit  risk of the financial assets under this rule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the  financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The documents shall require the establishment of a reserve fund  equal to at least five (5) percent of the cash proceeds of the  securitization payable to the sponsor to cover the repurchase of any  financial assets required for breach of representations and warranties.  The balance of such fund, if any, shall be released to the sponsor one  year after the date of issuance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The documents shall include a representation that the assets  shall have been originated in all material respects in compliance with  statutory, regulatory, and originator underwriting standards in effect  at the time of origination. The documents shall include a representation  that the mortgages included in the securitization were underwritten at  the fully indexed rate, based upon the borrowers' ability to repay the  mortgage according to its terms, and rely on documented income and  comply with all existing supervisory guidance governing the underwriting  of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non- Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency  Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or  additional regulations or guidance applicable to insured depository  institutions at the time of loan origination. Residential mortgages  originated prior to the issuance of such guidance shall meet all  supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages  then in effect at the time of loan origination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transaction should be an arms  length, bona fide securitization transaction. The documents shall  require that the obligations issued in a securitization shall not be  predominantly sold to an affiliate (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary  consolidated for accounting and capital purposes with the sponsor) or  insider of the sponsor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The securitization agreements are in writing, approved by the  board of directors of the bank or its loan committee (as reflected in  the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors or committee), and  have been, continuously, from the time of execution in the official  record of the bank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The securitization was entered into in the ordinary course of  business, not in contemplation of insolvency and with no intent to  hinder, delay or defraud the bank or its creditors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transfer was made for adequate consideration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The transfer and/or security interest was properly perfected  under the UCC or applicable state law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The transfer and duties of the sponsor as transferor must be  evidenced in a separate agreement from its duties, if any, as servicer,  custodian, paying agent, credit support provider or in any capacity  other than the transferor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The documents shall require that the sponsor separately identify  in its financial asset data bases the financial assets transferred into  any securitization and maintain an electronic or paper copy of the  closing documents for each securitization in a readily accessible form,  a current list of all of its outstanding securitizations and issuing  entities, and the most recent Form 10-K, if applicable, or other  periodic financial report for each securitization and issuing entity.  The documents shall provide that to the extent serving as servicer,  custodian or paying agent for the securitization, the sponsor shall not  comingle amounts received with respect to the financial assets with its  own assets except for the time, not to exceed two business days,  necessary to clear any payments received. The documents shall require  that the sponsor shall make these records readily available for review  by the FDIC promptly upon written request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safe harbor--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participations. With respect to transfers of  financial assets made in connection with participations, the FDIC as  conservator or receiver shall not, in the exercise of its statutory  authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or  recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any  such transferred financial assets, provided that such transfer satisfies  the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted  accounting principles, except for the ``legal isolation'' condition that  is addressed by this section. The foregoing paragraph shall apply to a  last-in, first-out participation, provided that the transfer of a  portion of the financial asset satisfies the conditions for sale  accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles that  would have applied to such portion if it had met the definition of a  ``participating interest,'' except for the ``legal isolation''   condition that is addressed by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition period safe harbor. With respect to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any participation or securitization for which transfers of  financial assets were made on or before December 31, 2010 or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any obligations of revolving trusts or master trusts, for which  one or more obligations were issued as of the date of adoption of this  rule, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any obligations issued under open commitments up to the  maximum amount of such commitments as of the date of adoption of this  rule if one or more obligations were issued under such commitments on or  before December 31, 2010, the FDIC as conservator or receiver shall not,  in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate  contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the  institution or the receivership the transferred financial assets  notwithstanding that the transfer of such financial assets does not  satisfy all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally  accepted accounting principles as effective for reporting periods after  November 15, 2009, provided that such transfer satisfied the conditions  for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting  principles in effect for reporting periods before November 15, 2009,  except for the ``legal isolation'' condition that is addressed by this  paragraph and the transaction otherwise satisfied the provisions of  Sec. 360.6 in effect prior to the effective date of this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For securitization not meeting sale accounting requirements.  With respect to any securitization for which transfers of financial  assets were made after December 31, 2010, or from a master trust or  revolving trust established after adoption of this rule or from any open  commitments that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) or  (d)(3) of this section, and which complies with the requirements  applicable to that securitization as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c)  of this section, but where the transfer does not satisfy the conditions  for sale accounting treatment set forth by generally accepted accounting  principles in effect for reporting periods after November 15, 2009:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monetary default. If at any time after appointment, the FDIC as  conservator or receiver is in a monetary default under a securitization  due to its failure to pay or apply collections from the financial assets  received by it in accordance with the securitization documents, whether  as servicer or otherwise, and remains in monetary default for ten (10)  business days after actual delivery of a written notice to the FDIC  pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section requesting the exercise of  contractual rights because of such monetary default, the FDIC hereby  consents pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2)  to the exercise of any contractual rights in accordance with the  documents governing such securitization, including but not limited to  taking possession of the financial assets and exercising self-help  remedies as a secured creditor under the transfer agreements, provided  no involvement of the receiver or conservator is required other than  such consents, waivers, or execution of transfer documents as may be  reasonably requested in the ordinary course of business in order to  facilitate the exercise   of such contractual rights. Such consent shall not waive or otherwise  deprive the FDIC or its assignees of any seller's interest or other  obligation or interest issued by the issuing entity and held by the FDIC  or its assignees, but shall serve as full satisfaction of the  obligations of the insured depository institution in conservatorship or  receivership and the FDIC as conservator or receiver for all amounts  due.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repudiation. If the FDIC as conservator or receiver provides a  written notice of repudiation of the securitization agreement pursuant  to which the financial assets were transferred, and the FDIC does not  pay damages, defined in this paragraph, within ten (10) business days  following the effective date of the notice, the FDIC hereby consents  pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) to the  exercise of any contractual rights in accordance with the documents  governing such securitization, including but not limited to taking  possession of the financial assets and exercising self-help remedies as  a secured creditor under the transfer agreements, provided no  involvement of the receiver or conservator is required other than such  consents, waivers, or execution of transfer documents as may be  reasonably requested in the ordinary course of business in order to  facilitate the exercise of such contractual rights. For purposes of this  paragraph, the damages due shall be in an amount equal to the par value  of the obligations outstanding on the date of appointment of the  conservator or receiver, less any payments of principal received by the  investors through the date of repudiation, plus unpaid, accrued interest  through the date of repudiation in accordance with the contract  documents to the extent actually received through payments on the  financial assets received through the date of repudiation. Upon payment  of such repudiation damages, all liens or claims on the financial assets  created pursuant to the securitization documents shall be released. Such  consent shall not waive or otherwise deprive the FDIC or its assignees  of any seller's interest or other obligation or interest issued by the  issuing entity and held by the FDIC or its assignees, but shall serve as  full satisfaction of the obligations of the insured depository  institution in conservatorship or receivership and the FDIC as  conservator or receiver for all amounts due.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of repudiation. If the FDIC repudiates or disaffirms a  securitization agreement, it shall not assert that any interest payments  made to investors in accordance with the securitization documents before  any such repudiation or disaffirmance remain the property of the  conservatorship or receivership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(13)(C)</em> to the making of, or if serving as servicer, shall make,  the payments to the investors to the extent actually received through  payments on the financial assets (but in the case of repudiation, only  to the extent supported by payments on the financial assets received  through the date of the giving of notice of repudiation) in accordance  with the securitization documents, and, subject to the FDIC's rights to  repudiate such agreements, consents to any servicing activity required  in furtherance of the securitization or, if acting as servicer the FDIC  as receiver or conservator shall perform such servicing activities in  accordance with the terms of the applicable servicing agreements, with  respect to the financial assets included in securitizations that meet  the requirements applicable to that securitization as set forth in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice for consent. Any party requesting the FDIC's consent as  conservator or receiver under 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C.  1825(b)(2) pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section shall provide  notice to the Deputy Director, Division of Resolutions and  Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street,  NW., F-7076, Washington, DC 20429-0002, and a statement of the basis  upon which such request is made, and copies of all documentation  supporting such request, including without limitation a   copy of the applicable agreements and of any applicable notices under  the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contemporaneous requirement. The FDIC will not seek to avoid an  otherwise legally enforceable agreement that is executed by an insured  depository institution in connection with a securitization or in the  form of a participation solely because the agreement does not meet the  ``contemporaneous'' requirement of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(9), 1821(n)(4)(I),  or 1823(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Limitations. The consents set forth in this section do not act  to waive or relinquish any rights granted to the FDIC in any capacity,  pursuant to any other applicable law or any agreement or contract except  as specifically set forth herein. Nothing contained in this section  alters the claims priority of the securitized obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> No waiver. Except as specifically set forth herein, this section  does not authorize, and shall not be construed as authorizing the waiver  of the prohibitions in 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) against levy, attachment,  garnishment, foreclosure, or sale of property of the FDIC, nor does it  authorize nor shall it be construed as authorizing the attachment of any  involuntary lien upon the property of the FDIC. Nor shall this section  be construed as waiving, limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or  powers of the FDIC to take any action or to exercise any power not  specifically mentioned, including but not limited to any rights, powers  or remedies of the FDIC regarding transfers or other conveyances taken  in contemplation of the institution's insolvency or with the intent to  hinder, delay or defraud the institution or the creditors of such  institution, or that is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> No assignment. The right to consent under 12 U.S.C.  1821(e)(13)(C) or 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2), may not be assigned or  transferred to any purchaser of property from the FDIC, other than to a  conservator or bridge bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Repeal. This section may be repealed by the FDIC upon 30 days  notice provided in the Federal Register, but any repeal shall not apply  to any issuance made in accordance with this section before such repeal.
