The Secretary shall act  expeditiously on all requests and shall notify the requester of her  decision in writing. If the Secretary determines that there is no need  to establish a Specification for labeling the requested consumer product  performance characteristics, or because of a lack of resources, she will  decline to act further on the request. In those instances where the  Secretary declines a request, she shall state the reasons for so  declining.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Secretary finds that a need exists to establish a  Specification for labeling a consumer product under this program, she  shall publish a notice in the Federal Register setting out such finding  and its basis and stating that she is developing a proposed  Specification in accordance with Sec. 16.5.</p>
