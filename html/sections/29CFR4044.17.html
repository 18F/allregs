A plan may establish one or more subclasses within  any priority category, other than priority categories 1 and 2, which  subclasses will govern the allocation of assets within that priority  category. The subclasses may be based only on a participant's longer  service, older age, or disability, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,  whenever the allocation within a priority category on the basis of the  subclasses established by the plan increases or decreases the cumulative  amount of assets that otherwise would be allocated to guaranteed  benefits, the assets so shifted shall be reallocated to other  participants' benefits within the priority category in accordance with  the subclasses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception for subclasses in effect on September 2, 1974. A plan  administrator may allocate assets to subclasses within any priority  category, other than priority categories 1 and 2, without regard to the  limitation in paragraph (b)   of this section if, on September 2, 1974, the plan provided for  allocation of plan assets upon termination of the plan based on a  participant's longer service, older age, or disability, or any  combination thereof, and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such provisions are still in effect; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plan, if subsequently amended to modify or remove those  subclasses, is re-amended to re-establish the same subclasses on or  before July 28, 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Discrimination under Code. Notwithstanding the provisions of  paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, allocation of assets to  subclasses established under this section is permitted only to the  extent that the allocation does not result in discrimination prohibited  under the Code and regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2">Allocation of Residual Assets    Sec. 4044.30  [Reserved]</p>
