Each health care  entity must report to the NPDB and provide a copy of the report to the  Board of Medical Examiners in the state in which the health care entity  is located the following actions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any professional review action that adversely affects the  clinical privileges of a physician or dentist for a period longer than  30 days,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acceptance of the surrender of clinical privileges or any  restriction of such privileges by a physician or dentist:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> While the physician or dentist is under investigation by the  health care   entity relating to possible incompetence or improper professional  conduct, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In return for not conducting such an investigation or  proceeding, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a health care entity which is a professional  society, when it takes a professional review action concerning a  physician or dentist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary reporting on other health care practitioners. A health  care entity may report to the NPDB information as described in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section concerning actions described in paragraph (a)(1)  in this section with respect to other health care practitioners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> What information must be reported. The health care entity must  report the following information concerning actions described in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to a physician or dentist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Work address,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Home address, if known,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Social Security Number, if known, and if obtained in accordance  with section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Date of birth,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Name of each professional school attended and year of  graduation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For each professional license: the license number, the field  of licensure, and the name of the state or territory in which the  license is held,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> DEA registration number, if known,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A description of the acts or omissions or other reasons for  privilege loss, or, if known, for surrender,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Action taken, date the action was taken, and effective date of  the action, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Other information as required by the Secretary from time to  time after publication in the Federal Register and after an opportunity  for public comment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reporting by the Board of Medical Examiners to the NPDB. Each  Board must report any known instances of a health care entity's failure  to report information as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. In addition, each Board of Medical Examiners must  simultaneously report this information to the appropriate state  licensing board in the state in which the health care entity is located,  if the Board of Medical Examiners is not such licensing board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sanctions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Health care entities. If the Secretary has reason  to believe that a health care entity has substantially failed to report  information in accordance with this section, the Secretary will conduct  an investigation. If the investigation shows that the health care entity  has not complied with this section, the Secretary will provide the  entity with a written notice describing the noncompliance, giving the  health care entity an opportunity to correct the noncompliance, and  stating that the entity may request, within 30 days after receipt of  such notice, a hearing with respect to the noncompliance. The request  for a hearing must contain a statement of the material factual issues in  dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues  must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the  Washington, DC, metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request for a hearing is untimely,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The health care entity does not provide a statement of material  factual issues in dispute, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or  inconsequential.</p><p class="depth4">In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will  send a written denial to the health care entity setting forth the  reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or, if as a result of the  hearing the entity is found to be in noncompliance, the Secretary will  publish the name of the health care entity in the Federal Register. In  such case, the immunity protections provided under section 411(a) of  HCQIA will not apply to the health care entity for professional review  activities that occur during the 3-year period beginning 30 days after  the date of publication of the entity's name in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Board of Medical Examiners. If, after notice of noncompliance  and providing opportunity to correct noncompliance, the Secretary  determines that a Board of Medical Examiners has   failed to report information in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section, the Secretary will designate another qualified entity for the  reporting of this information.</p>
