                            <p class="depth0">A complete record of all measured parameters used in the GHG emissions calculations is required. Therefore, whenever a quality-assured value of a required parameter is unavailable (e.g., if a meter malfunctions during unit operation or if a required sample is not taken), a substitute data value for the missing parameter must be used in the calculations, according to the following requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each missing weekly value of COD or BOD5 or wastewater flow entering an anaerobic wastewater treatment process, the substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of those parameters for the week immediately preceding and the week immediately following the missing data incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each missing value of the CH4 content or biogas flow rates, the substitute data value must be the arithmetic average of the quality-assured values of that parameter immediately preceding and immediately following the missing data incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, for a particular parameter, no quality-assured data are available prior to the missing data incident, the substitute data value must be the first quality-assured value obtained after the missing data period. If, for a particular parameter, the ``after'' value is not obtained by the end of the reporting year, you may use the last quality-assured value obtained ``before'' the missing data period for the missing data substitution. You must document and keep records of the procedures you use for all such estimates.
