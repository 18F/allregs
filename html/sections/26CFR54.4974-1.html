                                Sec. 54.4974-1  Excise tax on accumulations in individual
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A tax equal to 50 percent of the amount by which  the minimum amount required to be distributed from an individual  retirement account or annuity described in section 408 during the  taxable year of the payee under paragraph (b) of this section exceeds  the amount actually distributed during the taxable year is imposed by  section 4974 on the payee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(6)(v)</em> to be distributed in the taxable  year described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In 1975, the minimum amount required to be distributed  under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(6)(v) to A under his individual retirement  account is $100. Only $60 is actually distributed to A in 1975. Under  section 4974, A would have an excise tax liability of $20 [50% of ($100- $60)].</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Although no distribution is required under Sec. 1.408- 2(b)(6)(v) to be made in 1986, H, a married individual born on February  1, 1921, who has established and maintained an individual retirement  account decides to begin receiving distributions from the account  beginning in 1986. H's wife, W, was born on March 6, 1921. H and W are  calendar year taxpayers. H decides to receive his interest in the  account over the joint life and last survivor expectancy of himself and  his wife. On January 1, 1986, the balance in H's account is $10,000; H  and W, based on their nearest birthdates, are 65; and the joint life and  last survivor expectancy of H and his wife is 22.0 years (see Table II  of Sec. 1.72-9). His annual payments during the following years (none  of which were required) were determined by dividing the balance in the  account on the first day of each year by the joint life and last  survivor expectancy reduced by the number of whole years elapsed since  the distributions were to commence.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Life      Account</p><p class="depth2">expectancy   balance</p><p class="depth2">minus        at      Annual</p><p class="depth2">Date                       whole    beginning  payment</p><p class="depth2">years     of each</p><p class="depth2">elapsed      year ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Jan. 1, 1986............................      22.0      $10,000    $455 Jan. 1, 1987............................      21.0       10,118     482 Jan. 1, 1988............................      20.0       10,214     511 Jan. 1, 1989............................      19.0       10,285     541 Jan. 1, 1990............................      18.0       10,329     574 Jan. 1, 1991............................      17.0       10,340     608 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   For 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1990, the amount required to be distributed  under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(6)(v) is zero. Thus, H would have no excise tax  liability under section 4974 for these years. In 1991, the year H  attains age 70\1/2\, the amount required to be distributed from the  account under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(6)(v) is $565, determined by dividing  $10,340 (the account balance as of January 1, 1991) by 18.8 years (the  joint life and last survivor expectancy of H and W, assuming they are  both still living, as of January 1, 1991). If W should die after  December 31, 1990, the joint life and last survivor expectancy  determined on January 1, 1991 (18.3 years) would not be redetermined.  Because the amount distributed from the account in 1991 ($608) exceeds  the amount required to be distributed from the account in 1991 ($565), H  has no excise tax liability under section 4974 for 1991.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that W  dies in 1988. For 1988, 1989, and 1990, the amount required to be  distributed under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(6)(v) is zero. Thus, H would have no  excise tax liability under section 4974 for these years. In 1991, the  amount required to be distributed under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(6)(v) is $855,  determined by dividing $10,340 (the account balance as of January 1,  1991) by 12.1 years (the life expectancy of H as of January 1, 1991).  Because the amount distributed from the account in 1991 ($608) is less  than the amount required to be distributed from the account in 1991  ($855), H has an excise tax liability of $123.50 under section 4974 for  1991 [50% of ($855-$608)].
