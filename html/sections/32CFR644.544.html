                                Sec. 644.544  Negotiated sales.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To private parties. Negotiated sales to private parties are not  viewed with favor. Generally, such negotiated sales will be approved  only where an emergency exists that will not permit advertising, where  advertising would serve no useful purpose, or where a negotiated sale is  in the best interest of the Government. Emergencies which justify sales  without advertising do not ordinarily justify sales without competition.  Instances are rare where the emergency is such that time does not permit  the oral solicitation of quotations from more than one source. In any  sales which are made without benefit of advertising, competition by  informal solicitation and quotation will be obtained to the maximum  extent feasible under the circumstances. Such sales should be negotiated  at the best terms obtainable and at not less than the appraised fair  market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To eligible agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acts of Congress listed in the Federal  Property Management Regulation, Sec. 101-47.4905 (Illustrations),  authorize negotiated sales of surplus real property to states and other  eligible public agencies listed therein. The Acts listed, except section  203(c)(3)(H) of the Federal Property Act (40 U.S.C. 484(c)(3)(H)), cover  special classifications of property for specialized use, the most  important of which is disposal of airport property. The section of the  Act cited authorizes negotiated sales of surplus property to states,  territories, possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax- supported agencies thereof, provided the appraised fair market value of  the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained. (The  other Acts listed in Sec. 101-47.4905 provide for disposal subject to  conditions of use but without consideration, or at reduced  consideration, except power transmission lines which are sold without  conditions but at the appraised fair   market value.) Notification that surplus property is available for  disposal will be given to eligible public agencies for all airport  property and for any other property where there is reason to believe  that an eligible public agency may be interested in the property or that  the property may be adaptable to the agency's use (Sec. Sec. 644.400  through 644.443).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title 10, United States Code, Section 4682, authorizes the  Secretary of the Army to sell obsolete or excess material at fair value  to the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The Judge Advocate  General has held that buildings and other improvements no longer  required by the Department be sold to that organization at the appraised  fair market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority to negotiate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DE is authorized to dispose of  land, improvements, related personal property and real property  components (including standing timber and embedded sand, gravel, and  stone-quarried products in their unmined or natural state) with an  estimated fair market value of $1,000 or less by negotiated sale without  advertising, provided that such action is within the purview of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and satisfactory terms of  disposal can be obtained. Except as provided in Sec. 644.543 and  paragraph (b) of Sec. 644.544 all sales are not less than the appraised  fair market value. See paragraph (d) of this section for requirement for  appraisal by contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All other proposals to negotiate sales without advertising will  be submitted to DAEN-REM for advance approval. In submitting such  proposals, the nature of the emergency or other situation justifying the  waiver of advertising will be clearly stated. The property involved will  be adequately defined, and the appraised fair market value and proposed  price will be set forth. Negotiated sales of surplus property with an  appraised value in excess of $1,000 under provisions of the Federal  Property Act cited in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, require  submission of an explanatory statement to the Government Operations  Committees of Congress. Under the FPMR, a statement must be submitted at  least 35 days in advance of each such negotiated disposal. When  required, the DE will forward a draft of statement to HQDA (DAEN-REM)  for transmittal to GSA for submission to the Committees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appraisal by contract. Pursuant to Federal Property Management  Regulation, Sec. 101-47.304-9(b), where sales are to be negotiated  under the authority provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,  a contract appraisal should be obtained provided that the cost of such a  contract would not be out of proportion to the recoverable value of the  property and is in the best interest of the Government. If such is not  the case, the head of the disposal agency, or his designee, may  authorize any other appropriate method to obtain an estimate of fair  market value. Requests for waiver will be forwarded to DAEN-REM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record to justify waiver of advertising. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written  justification for negotiated sales made under the authority of these  instructions will be prepared and filed by the DE with the record of  disposal in each case. A copy of Standard Form 1036 may be used for this  purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for those cases covered by paragraph (b) of this section,  the nature of the emergency compelling waiver of advertising, the reason  why it was considered that advertising would serve no useful purpose, or  why the negotiated sale was considered to be in the best interest of the  Government, will be clearly stated. In cases where an explanatory  statement is transmitted to the Committees on Government Operations, a  copy of that statement will be furnished the appropriate GSA Regional  Office and filed with the record of the case as the required  documentation of justification for waiver of advertising. DAEN-REM will  make available to the DE necessary copies of such statements for filing  or distribution.</p>
