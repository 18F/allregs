                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Form of notice. A notice required by Sec. 174.3 of this part  shall be filed on the form indicated below. An acquiror may request  confidential treatment of portions of a notice only by complying with  the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)-(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notice Form 1393, parts A and B. This form shall be used for all  notices filed under Sec. 174.3(b) of this part regarding the acquisition  of control of a Federal savings association by any person or persons not  constituting a company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Filing requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notices, and rebuttals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Complete  copies including exhibits and all other pertinent documents of notices  and rebuttal submissions shall be filed with the appropriate OCC  licensing office. Unsigned copies shall be conformed. Each copy shall  include a summary of the proposed transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any person or company may amend a notice or rebuttal  submission, or file additional information, upon request of the OCC or,  in the case of the party filing a notice or rebuttal, upon such party's  own initiative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sufficiency and waiver. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  Sec. 174.6(c)(5), a notice filed pursuant to Sec. 174.3(b) shall not be  deemed sufficient unless it includes all of the information required by  the form prescribed by the OCC and this part, including a complete  description of the acquiror's proposed plan for acquisition of control  whether pursuant to one or more transactions, and any additional  relevant information as the OCC may require by written request to the  acquiror. Unless a notice specifically indicates otherwise, the notice  shall be considered to pertain to acquisition of 100 percent of a  Federal savings association's voting stock. Where a notice pertains to a  lesser amount of stock, the OCC may condition its non-disapproval to  apply only to such amount, in which case additional acquisitions may be  made only by amendment to the acquiror's notice and the OCC's non- disapproval thereof. Failure by an acquiror to respond completely to a  written request by the OCC for additional information within 30 calendar  days of the date of such request may be deemed to constitute withdrawal  of the notice or rebuttal filing or may be treated as grounds for an  issuance of a notice of disapproval of a notice or rejection of a  rebuttal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The period for the OCC's review of any proposed acquisition will  commence upon receipt by the OCC of a notice deemed sufficient under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The OCC shall notify an acquiror in  writing within 30 calendar days after proper filing of a notice as to  whether the notice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is sufficient;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is insufficient, and what additional information is requested  in order to render the notice sufficient; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is materially deficient and will not be processed. The OCC  shall also notify an acquiror in writing within 15 calendar days after  proper filing of any additional information furnished in response to a  specific request by the OCC as to whether the notice is thereby deemed  to be sufficient. If the OCC fails to so notify an acquiror within such  time, the notice shall be deemed to be sufficient as of the expiration  of the applicable period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After additional information has been requested and supplied,  the OCC may request additional information only with respect to matters  derived from or prompted by information already furnished, or  information of a material nature that was not reasonably available from  the acquiror, was concealed, or pertains to developments subsequent to  the time of the OCC's initial request for additional information. With  regard to information of a material nature that was not reasonably  available from the acquiror or was concealed at the time a notice was  deemed to be sufficient or which pertains to developments subsequent to  the time a notice was deemed to be sufficient, the OCC, at its option,  may request such additional information as it considers necessary, or  may deem the notice not to be sufficient until such additional  information is furnished and cause the review period to commence again  in its entirety upon receipt of such additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The 60-day period for the OCC's review of a notice deemed to be  sufficient also may be extended by the OCC for up to an additional 30  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period for the OCC's review of a notice may be further  extended not to exceed two additional times for not more than 45 days  each time if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The OCC determines that any acquiring party has not furnished  all the information required under this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the OCC's judgment, any material information submitted is  substantially inaccurate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The OCC has been unable to complete an investigation of each  acquiror because of any delay caused by, or the inadequate cooperation  of, such acquiror; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The OCC determines that additional time is needed to investigate  and determine that no acquiring party has a record of failing to comply  with the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31 of the  United States Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The OCC may waive any requirements of this paragraph (c)  determined to be unnecessary by the OCC, upon its own initiative, upon  the written request of an acquiring person, or in a supervisory case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Public notice. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The acquiror must publish a public notice of  a notice under Sec. 174.3(b) of this chapter, in accordance with the  procedures in subpart B of part 116 of this chapter. Promptly after  publication, the acquiror must transmit copies of the public notice and  the publisher's affidavit to the OCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The acquiror must provide a copy of the public notice to the  savings association whose stock is sought to be acquired, and may  provide a copy of the public notice to any other person who may have an  interest in the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The OCC will notify the persons whose requests for  announcements, as described in 12 CFR part 195, appendix B, have been  received in time for the notification. The OCC may also notify any other  persons who may have an interest in the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Submission of comments. Commenters may submit comments on the  notice in accordance with the procedures in subpart C of part 116 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any notice, other filings, public comment, or  portion thereof, made pursuant to this part for which confidential  treatment is not requested in accordance with this paragraph (f), shall  be immediately available to the public and not subject to the procedures  set forth herein. Public disclosure shall be made of other portions of a  notice, other filing or public comment in accordance with paragraph  (f)(2) of this section, the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act  (5 U.S.C. 552a) and part 4 of this chapter. Submitters should provide  confidential and non-confidential versions of their   filings, as described in Sec. 174.6(f)(2) and (3) in order to facilitate  this process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any person who submits any information or causes or permits any  information to be submitted to the OCC pursuant to this part may request  that the OCC afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of  Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy or  business confidentiality, which shall include such information that  would be deemed to result in the commencement of a tender offer under  Sec. 240.14d-2 of title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or for  any other reason permitted by Federal law. Such request for  confidentiality must be made and justified in accordance with paragraph  (f)(5) of this section at the time of filing, and must, to the extent  practicable, identify with specificity the information for which  confidential treatment may be available and not merely indicate portions  of documents or entire documents in which such information is contained.  Failure to specifically identify information for which confidential  treatment is requested, failure to specifically justify the bases upon  which confidentiality is claimed in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of  this section, or overbroad and indiscriminate claims for confidential  treatment, may be bases for denial of the request. In addition, the  filing party should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as  nearly as practicable, that at the time the information is first  received by the OCC it is supplied segregated from information for which  confidential treatment is not being requested, it is appropriately  marked as confidential, and it is accompanied by a written request for  confidential treatment which identifies with specificity the information  as to which confidential treatment is requested. Any such request must  be substantiated in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All documents which contain information for which a request for  confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions  thereof shall be marked by the person submitting the records with a  prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each  page or segregable portion of each page, stating ``Confidential  Treatment Requested by [name].'' If such marking is impracticable under  the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked ``Confidential  Treatment Requested by [name]'' should be securely attached to each  group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is  requested. Each of the records transmitted in this manner should be  individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are  separately identifiable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A determination as to the validity of any request for  confidential treatment may be made when a request for disclosure of the  information under the Freedom of Information Act is received, or at any  time prior thereto. If the OCC receives a request for the information  under the Freedom of Information Act, the OCC will advise the filing  party before it discloses material for which confidential treatment has  been requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall  consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or  necessary for the determination of the request for confidential  treatment, the following information regarding the request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific  exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the  information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of  Information Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory  provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The existence and applicability of any prior determination by  the OCC, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning confidential  treatment of the information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or  otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial  or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business'  competitive position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The measures taken by the business to protect the  confidentiality of   the commercial or financial information in question and of similar  information, prior to, and after, its submission to the OCC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling  the commercial or financial information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Whether commercial or financial information was voluntarily  submitted to the OCC, and, if so, whether and how disclosure of the  information would tend to impede the availability of similar information  to the OCC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation  of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded  confidential treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The amount of time after the consummation of the proposed  acquisition for which the information should remain confidential and a  justification thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as  the requesting person may consider appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any person requesting access to a notice, other filing, or  public comment made pursuant to this part for purposes of commenting on  a pending submission may prominently label such request: ``Request for  Disclosure of Filing(s) Made Under part 174/Priority Treatment  Requested.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Supervisory cases. The provisions of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f)  of this section may be waived by the OCC in connection with a  transaction approved by the OCC for supervisory reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additional procedures for acquisitions involving mergers.  Acquisitions of control involving mergers (including mergers with an  interim association) shall also be subject to the procedures set forth  in Sec. 163.22 of this chapter to the extent applicable, except as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Additional procedures for acquisitions of recently converted  savings associations. Notices and rebuttals involving acquisitions of  the stock of a recently converted savings association under  Sec. 192.3(i)(3) of this chapter shall also address the criteria for  approval set forth at Sec. 192.3(i)(5) of this chapter.</p>
