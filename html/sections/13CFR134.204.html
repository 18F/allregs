                            <p class="depth0">All pleadings or other submissions must be filed with OHA and served  on all other parties or their attorneys. Each submission requires a  certificate of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Methods of filing and service. E-mail, mail, delivery, and  facsimile are all permitted unless a Judge orders otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> E-mail constitutes any system for sending and receiving messages  electronically over a telecommunications network. The sender is  responsible for ensuring that e-mail software and file formats are  compatible with the recipient and for a successful, virus-free  transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mail includes any service provided by the U.S. Postal Service.  Mail (except ``Express Mail'') is not recommended for time-sensitive  filings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Delivery is personal delivery by a party, its employee, its  attorney, or a commercial delivery service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Facsimile submissions should not exceed 30 pages. Contact OHA  before faxing longer submissions. Follow-up originals or ``hard copies''  are not required unless OHA or another party specifically requests them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing. Filing is the receipt of pleadings and other submissions  at   OHA. Filers may call OHA to verify receipt. OHA's telephone number is  (202) 401-8200.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OHA's address. OHA accepts filings: by e-mail at  OHAFilings@sba.gov; by mail or delivery at Office of Hearings and  Appeals, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW.,  Washington, DC 20416; and by facsimile at (202) 205-7059.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of filing is the date the submission is received at  OHA. Any submission received at OHA after 5 p.m. eastern time is  considered filed the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exhibits. An exhibit, whether an original or a copy, must be  authenticated or identified to be what it purports to be. Parties are  referred to 28 U.S.C. 1746.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies. No extra copies of pleadings or other submissions need  be filed. If a document is offered as an exhibit, a copy of the document  will be accepted by the Judge unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> a genuine question is raised as to whether it is a true and  accurate copy; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> it would be unfair, under the circumstances, to admit the copy  instead of the original.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service. Service means sending a copy of a pleading or other  submission filed with OHA to another party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complete copies of all pleadings and other submissions filed  with OHA must be served upon all other parties or, if represented, their  attorneys, at their record addresses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of service is as follows: for e-mail and facsimile, the  date the copy is sent; for personal delivery, the date the copy is given  to the party, its attorney, or the commercial delivery service (if one  is used). For mail, date of service is postmark date; in absence of a  legible postmark, there is a rebuttable presumption that the copy was  mailed five days before the served party's receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SBA address. The correct office(s) of SBA must be served, as  required by the applicable program regulations, by other subparts of  part 134, or by the instructions on the SBA determination being  appealed. If the SBA office for service is not specified elsewhere,  serve: Office of General Counsel, U.S. Small Business Administration,  409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Confidential information. If a pleading or other submission  contains proprietary or confidential information, that information may  be redacted (deleted) from any copies served upon non-government  parties. Counsel for those parties may access the redacted information  only under the protective order procedure described in Sec. 134.205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certificate of service. A certificate of service shows how,  when, and to whom service was made. Each submission to OHA must include  a certificate of service. The certificate should state: ``I certify that  on [date], I served the foregoing [type of submission] by [e-mail, mail,  Express Mail, personal delivery, commercial delivery service, facsimile]  upon the following''. List the name and address of each party served,  and either the facsimile number or the e-mail address (if applicable).  The individual serving the submission must sign the certificate and  either print or type his or her name and title.  [75 FR 47439, Aug. 6, 2010]</p>
