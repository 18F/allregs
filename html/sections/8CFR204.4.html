If the petition is approved the beneficiary is classified as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An unmarried beneficiary under the age of twenty-one is classified as the child of a United States citizen under section 201(b) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An unmarried beneficiary twenty-one years of age or older is classified as the unmarried son or daughter of a United States citizen under section 203(a)(1) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A married beneficiary is classified as the married son or daughter of a

United States citizen under section 203(a)(3) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement of affidavit of financial support and intent to petition for legal custody. A guarantee of financial support and intent to petition for legal custody on Form I-361 may be enforced against the alien's sponsor in a civil suit brought by the Attorney General in the United States District Court for the district in which the sponsor resides, except that the sponsor's estate is not liable under the guarantee if the sponsor dies or is adjudicated as bankrupt under title 11, United States Code. After admission to the United States, if the beneficiary of a petition requires enforcement of the guarantee of financial support and intent to petition for legal custody executed by the beneficiary's sponsor, the beneficiary may file Form I-363 with USCIS. If the beneficiary is under eighteen years of age, any agency or individual (other than the sponsor) having legal custody of the beneficiary, or a legal guardian acting on the alien's behalf, may file Form I-363.
