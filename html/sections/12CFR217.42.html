                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Securitization risk weight approaches. Except as provided  elsewhere in this section or in Sec. 217.41:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A Board-regulated institution must deduct from common equity  tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a  securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a  CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a Board-regulated institution may  assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified  supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with Sec. Sec.  217.43(a) through 217.43(d) and subject to the limitation under  paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, a Board-regulated  institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a  risk weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up approach  in accordance with Sec. 217.43(e), provided, however, that such Board- regulated institution must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up  approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except  as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the Board-regulated institution  cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the  exposure, the Board-regulated institution must assign a risk weight to  the exposure as described in Sec. 217.44.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other  than protection provided by a Board-regulated institution in the form of  a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows  from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under  interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other  similar payments), a Board-regulated institution may choose to set the  risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the  exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures. A  Board-regulated institution's total risk-weighted assets for  securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset  amount for securitization exposures that the Board-regulated institution  risk weights under Sec. Sec. 217.41(c), 217.42(a)(1), and 217.43,  217.44, or 217.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exposure amount of a securitization exposure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On-balance  sheet securitization exposures. The exposure amount of an on-balance  sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held- to-maturity security where the Board-regulated institution has made an  AOCI opt-out election under Sec. 217.22(b)(2), a repo-style  transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared  transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is the Board-regulated institution's carrying value  (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net  unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on  the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Off-balance sheet securitization exposures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as  provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an  off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style  transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a  credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit  derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance  sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible  ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the  maximum potential amount that the Board-regulated institution could be  required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets  (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those  assets).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Board-regulated institution must determine the exposure  amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does  not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of  50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A Board-regulated institution must determine the exposure  amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies  by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and derivative  contracts. The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a  repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract  (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the  transaction as calculated under Sec. 217.34 or Sec. 217.37, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Overlapping exposures. If a Board-regulated institution has  multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to  the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when a Board- regulated institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and  multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the  Board-regulated institution is not required to hold duplicative risk- based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the Board- regulated institution may apply to the overlapping position the  applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest  risk-based capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Implicit support. If a Board-regulated institution provides  support to a securitization in excess of the Board-   regulated institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support  to the securitization (implicit support):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Board-regulated institution must include in risk-weighted  assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the  securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must  deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale  resulting from the securitization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board-regulated institution must disclose publicly:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The risk-based capital impact to the Board-regulated  institution of providing such implicit support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a Board-regulated  institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance  facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential  future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under  the contract governing the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a Board-regulated institution that acts as a servicer, the  exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an  eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all  potential future cash advance payments that the Board-regulated  institution may be contractually required to provide during the  subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Interest-only mortgage-backed securities. Regardless of any  other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit- enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than  100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred  with retained contractual exposure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Regardless of any other  provision of this subpart, a Board-regulated institution that has  transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small- business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets  only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all  the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Board-regulated institution establishes and maintains,  pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the Board- regulated institution's reasonably estimated liability under the  contractual obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the  criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business  Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.  632 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a state member bank, the bank is well  capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 208.43. For purposes of determining  whether a state member bank is well capitalized for purposes of this  paragraph (h), the state member bank's capital ratios must be calculated  without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business  obligations under this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a bank holding company or savings and loan  holding company, the bank holding company or savings and loan holding  company is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 225.2. For purposes of  determining whether a bank holding company or savings and loan holding  company is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the bank  holding company or savings and loan holding company's capital ratios  must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers  of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph  (k)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by  a Board-regulated institution on transfers of small-business obligations  receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section cannot exceed 15 percent of the Board-regulated institution's  total capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a Board-regulated institution ceases to be well capitalized  under 12 CFR 208.43 or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation  provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment  under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any  transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual  exposure that occurred during the time that the Board-regulated  institution   was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The risk-based capital ratios of the Board-regulated institution  must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers  of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section for purposes of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining whether a Board-regulated institution is adequately  capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or  critically undercapitalized under the Board's prompt corrective action  regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reclassifying a well-capitalized Board-regulated institution to  adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized Board- regulated institution to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary  supervisory actions as if the Board-regulated institution were in the  next lower prompt-corrective-action category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nth-to-default credit derivatives--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Protection provider. A  Board-regulated institution may assign a risk weight using the SSFA in  Sec. 217.43 to an nth-to-default credit derivative in  accordance with this paragraph (i). A Board-regulated institution must  determine its exposure in the nth-to-default credit  derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying  exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of determining the risk weight for an  nth-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA, the Board- regulated institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment  point of its exposure as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of  the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated  to the Board-regulated institution's exposure to the total notional  amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal  value between zero and one. In the case of a first-to-default credit  derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to  the Board-regulated institution's exposure. In the case of a second-or- subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional  amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the Board- regulated institution's exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The detachment point (parameter D) equals the sum of parameter  A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the Board-regulated  institution's exposure in the nth-to-default credit  derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The  ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A Board-regulated institution that does not use the SSFA to  determine a risk weight for its nth-to-default credit  derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Protection purchaser--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First-to-default credit derivatives. A  Board-regulated institution that obtains credit protection on a group of  underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that  meets the rules of recognition of Sec. 217.36(b) must determine its  risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the  Board-regulated institution synthetically securitized the underlying  exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained  no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A Board- regulated institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement  for counterparty credit risk according to Sec. 217.34 for a first-to- default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of  Sec. 217.36(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivatives. (A) A  Board-regulated institution that obtains credit protection on a group of  underlying exposures through a nth-to-default credit  derivative that meets the rules of recognition of Sec. 217.36(b) (other  than a first-to-default credit derivative) may recognize the credit risk  mitigation benefits of the derivative only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Board-regulated institution also has obtained credit  protection on the same underlying exposures in the form of first- through-(n-1)-to-default credit derivatives; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If n-1 of the underlying exposures have already defaulted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a Board-regulated institution satisfies the requirements of  paragraph (i)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the Board-regulated institution  must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying  exposures as if the Board-regulated institution had only   synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the  nth smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no  credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A Board-regulated institution must calculate a risk-based  capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to Sec.  217.34 for a nth-to-default credit derivative that does not  meet the rules of recognition of Sec. 217.36(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Guarantees and credit derivatives other than nth-to-default  credit derivatives--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Protection provider. For a guarantee or credit  derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative)  provided by a Board-regulated institution that covers the full amount or  a pro rata share of a securitization exposure's principal and interest,  the Board-regulated institution must risk weight the guarantee or credit  derivative as if it holds the portion of the reference exposure covered  by the guarantee or credit derivative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protection purchaser. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Board-regulated institution that  purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an  nth-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under  Sec. 217.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral  recognized under Sec. 217.37) is not required to compute a separate  counterparty credit risk capital requirement under Sec. 217.31, in  accordance with 34(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a Board-regulated institution cannot, or chooses not to,  recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under  Sec. 217.45, the Board-regulated institution must determine the  exposure amount of the credit derivative under Sec. 217.34.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the Board-regulated institution purchases credit protection  from a counterparty that is not a securitization SPE, the Board- regulated institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure  according to general risk weights under Sec. 217.32.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the Board-regulated institution purchases the credit  protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the Board- regulated institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure  according to section Sec. 217.42, including Sec. 217.42(a)(4) for a  credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from  the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding  amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees  due, or other similar payments).
