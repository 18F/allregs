                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cause for termination by HUD. HUD may terminate an agency's approval; remove an SHFA; remove one or more branches or affiliates from the HUD portion of an intermediary's, MSO's, or SHFA's counseling program; and terminate any grant agreements (if applicable) upon confirmation of any of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Noncompliance with program requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to implement in whole or in part the agency's approved housing counseling work plan or failure to notify HUD of changes in the agency's housing counseling work plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lack of the capacity to deliver the housing counseling activities described in its approved housing counseling work plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to achieve outcomes described in the work plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Misuse of grant funds; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> HUD determines that there is good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency withdrawal. The participating agency may withdraw from the Housing Counseling program at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Post-termination, post-withdrawal requirements. All terminations by HUD, or an agency's withdrawal, must be in writing. When a termination or withdrawal occurs, the agency must return to HUD any unexpired ``Certificate of Approval.'' A terminated or inactive agency cannot continue to display the certificate. If HUD has determined that an agency will be terminated from participating in the Housing Counseling program, and an agency does not voluntarily withdraw, then HUD may follow the provisions found in 24 CFR part 24.</p>
