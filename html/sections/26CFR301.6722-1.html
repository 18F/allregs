                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of penalty--(1) General rule. A penalty of $50 is imposed for each payee statement (as defined in section 6724(d)(2)) with respect to which a failure (as defined in section 6722(a) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section) occurs. No more than one penalty will be imposed under this paragraph (a) with respect to a single payee statement even though there may be more than one failure with respect to such statement. However, the penalty shall apply to failures on composite substitute payee statements as though each type of payment and other required information were furnished on separate statements. A ``composite substitute payee statement'' is a single document created by a filer to reflect several types of payments made to the same payee. The total amount imposed on any person for all failures during any calendar year with respect to all payee statements shall not exceed $100,000. See section 6722(c) and paragraph (c) of this section for higher penalties when a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements. See paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 301.6724-1 for a waiver of the penalty for a failure that is due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

See paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 301.6724-1 for a waiver of the penalty for a failure that is due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failures subject to the penalty. The failures to which section 6722(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A failure to furnish a payee statement on or before the prescribed date therefore to the person to whom such

statement is required to be furnished (``failure to furnish timely''), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A failure to include all of the information required to be shown on a payee statement or the inclusion of incorrect information (``failure to include correct information''). A failure to furnish timely includes a failure to furnish a written statement to the payee in a statement mailing as required under sections 6042(c), 6044(e), 6049(c), and 6050N(b), as well as a failure to furnish the statement on a form acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a failure to include correct information encompasses a failure to include the information required by applicable information reporting statutes or by any administrative pronouncements issued thereunder (such as regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, or information reporting forms).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception for inconsequential errors or omissions--(1) In general. An inconsequential error or omission is not considered a failure to include correct information. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term ``inconsequential error or omission'' means any failure that cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her return or from otherwise putting the statement to its intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An inconsequential error or omission is not considered a failure to include correct information. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term ``inconsequential error or omission'' means any failure that cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her return or from otherwise putting the statement to its intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Errors or omissions that are never inconsequential. Errors or omissions relating to the following are never inconsequential:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A dollar amount,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The significant items in the address of a payee, which is the address provided by the payee to the filer,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The appropriate form for the information provided (i.e., whether or not the form is an acceptable substitute for an official form of the Internal Revenue Service), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The manner of furnishing a statement required under sections 6042(c), 6044(e), 6049(e), and 6050N(b). The Internal Revenue Service may, by administrative pronouncement, specify other types of errors or omissions that are never inconsequential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples which do not take into account any possible application of the penalty for intentional disregard under paragraph (c) of this section or the reasonable cause waiver under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A payor furnishes a statement with respect to a Form 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous income). The payee statement is complete and correct, except the word ``boulevard'' is misspelled in the payee's address. The error cannot reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return or from otherwise putting the statement to its intended use. Therefore, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts in Example 1, except that the only error on the payee statement is that the payee's street address, 4821 Grant Boulevard, is reported incorrectly as 8421 Grant Boulevard. A penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the payee statement because the error can reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder the payee from timely receiving correct information and reporting it on his or her tax return or from otherwise putting the statement to its intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Higher penalty for intentional disregard of requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements--(1) Application of section 6722(c). If a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements, the amount of the penalty shall be determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Whether a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements is based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the failure. The facts and circumstances considered include those under Sec. 301.6721-1(f)(3), which shall apply in determining whether a failure under this section is due to intentional disregard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application of section 6722(c). If a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements, the amount of the penalty shall be determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Whether a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely correct payee statements is based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the failure. The facts and circumstances considered include those under Sec. 301.6721-1(f)(3), which shall apply in determining whether a failure under this section is due to intentional disregard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amount of the penalty. If one or more failures under paragraph (a) of this section are due to intentional disregard of the requirement to furnish timely payee statements or of the requirement to include correct information, then, with respect to each such failure determined under this paragraph (c)(2)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The $100,000 limitation under paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply and the penalty under this paragraph

(c)(2) shall not be taken into account in applying the $100,000 limitation to penalties not determined under this paragraph (c)(2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be $100 or, if greater, the statutory percentage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The term ``statutory percentage'' means--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a payee statement other than a statement required under section 6045(b), 6041A(e) (in respect of a return required under section 6041A(b)), 6050H(d), 6050J(e), 6050K(b), or 6060L(c), 10 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of the items required to be reported correctly, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a payee statement required under section 6045(b), 6050K(b), or 6050L(c), 5 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of the items required to be reported correctly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Computation of the penalty; aggregate dollar amount of items required to be shown correctly. The aggregate dollar amount used in computing the penalty under this paragraph (c) is the amount that is not reported or is reported incorrectly. If the intentional disregard relates to a dollar amount, the statutory percentage is applied to the difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount required to be reported correctly. If the intentional disregard relates to any other item on the return, the statutory percentage is applied to the aggregate amount of items required to be reported correctly. In determining such amount the same item shall be counted only once. For example, if a filer willfully fails to furnish a Form 1099-INT on which $800 of interest and $160 of Federal income tax withheld (i.e., backup withholding) is required to be shown, only the $800 amount is taken into account in computing the penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions--(1) Payee.
