                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part establishes special rules for all federally insured  corporate credit unions. Non federally insured corporate credit unions  must agree, by written contract, to both adhere to the requirements of  this part and submit to examinations, as determined by NCUA, as a  condition of receiving shares or deposits from federally insured credit  unions. This part grants certain additional authorities to federal  corporate credit unions. Except to the extent that they are inconsistent  with this part, other provisions of NCUA's Rules and Regulations (12 CFR  chapter VII) and the Federal Credit Union Act apply to federally  chartered corporate credit unions and federally insured state-chartered  corporate credit unions to the same extent that they apply to other  federally chartered and federally insured state-chartered credit unions,  respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board has the authority to issue orders which vary from this  part. This authority is provided under Section 120(a) of the Federal  Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1766(a). Requests by state-chartered  corporate credit unions for waivers to this part and for expansions of  authority under appendix B of this part must be approved by the state  regulator before being submitted to NCUA.</p>
