                            <p class="depth0">The question whether there was an erroneous inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition is determined under the provisions of the internal revenue laws applicable with respect to the year as to which the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, was made. The fact that the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, was in pursuance of an interpretation, either judicial or administrative, accorded such provisions of the internal revenue laws at the time of such action is not necessarily determinative of this question. For example, if a later judicial decision authoritatively alters such interpretation so that such action was contrary to such provisions of the internal revenue laws as later interpreted, the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, is erroneous within the meaning of section 1312.

Sec. 1.1313(a)-3  Final disposition of claim for refund as adetermination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A determination may take the form of a final disposition of a claim for refund. Such disposition may result in a determination with respect to two classes of items, i.e., items included by the taxpayer in a claim for refund and items applied by the Commissioner to offset the alleged overpayment. The time at which a disposition in respect of a particular item becomes final may depend not only upon what action is taken with respect to that item but also upon whether the claim for refund is allowed or disallowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Items with respect to which the taxpayer's claim is allowed. (1) The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is sustained becomes final on the date of allowance of the refund or credit if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is sustained becomes final on the date of allowance of the refund or credit if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's claim for refund is unqualifiedly allowed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained and with respect to other items is denied, so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained, but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment and the items so applied do not completely offset such amount but merely reduce it so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund with respect to an item is sustained but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment so that the net result is a disallowance of the claim for refund, the date of mailing, by registered mail, of the notice of disallowance (see section 6532) is the date of the final disposition as to the item with respect to which the taxpayer's contention is sustained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Items with respect to which the taxpayer's claim is disallowed. The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is denied becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed by section 6532 for instituting suit on the claim for refund, unless the suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxpayer's claim for refund is unqualifiedly disallowed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is denied and with respect to other items is sustained so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained in part and denied in part. For example, assume that the taxpayer claimed a deductible loss of $10,000 and a consequent overpayment of $2,500 and the Commissioner concedes that a deductible loss was sustained, but only in the amount of $5,000. The disposition of the claim for refund with respect to the allowance of the $5,000 and the disallowance of the remaining $5,000 becomes final upon the expiration of the time for instituting suit on the claim for refund unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Items applied by the Commissioner in reduction of the refund or credit. If the Commissioner applies an item in reduction of the overpayment alleged in the claim for refund, and the net result is an allowance of refund or credit, the disposition with respect to the item so applied by the Commissioner becomes final upon the expiration of the time

allowed by section 6532 for instituting suit on the claim for refund, unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period. If such application of the item results in the assertion of a deficiency, such action does not constitute a final disposition of a claim for refund within the meaning of Sec. 1.1313(a)-3, but subsequent action taken with respect to such deficiency may result in a determination under Sec. Sec. 1.1313(a)-1, 1.1313(a)-2, or 1.1313(a)-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Elimination of waiting period. The necessity of waiting for the expiration of the 2-year period of limitations provided in section 6532 may be avoided in such cases as are described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section by the use of a closing agreement (see Sec. 1.1313(a)-2) or agreement under Sec. 1.1313(a)-4 to effect a determination.

Sec. 1.1313(a)-4  Agreement pursuant to section 1313(a)(4)as a determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) A determination may take the form of an agreement made pursuant to this section. This section is intended to provide an expeditious method for obtaining an adjustment under section 1311 and for offsetting deficiencies and refunds whenever possible. The provisions of part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, must be strictly complied with in any such agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A determination may take the form of an agreement made pursuant to this section. This section is intended to provide an expeditious method for obtaining an adjustment under section 1311 and for offsetting deficiencies and refunds whenever possible. The provisions of part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, must be strictly complied with in any such agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An agreement made pursuant to this section will not, in itself, establish the tax liability for the open taxable year to which it relates, but it will state the amount of the tax, as then determined, for such open year. The tax may be the amount of tax shown on the return as filed by the taxpayer, but if any changes in the amount have been made, or if any are being made by documents executed concurrently with the execution of said agreement, such changes must be taken into account. For example, an agreement pursuant to this section may be executed concurrently with the execution of a waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of a deficiency or acceptance of an overassessment with respect to the open taxable year, or concurrently with the execution and filing of a stipulation in a proceeding before the Tax Court of the United States, where an item which is to be the subject of an adjustment under section 1311 is disposed of by the stipulation and is not left for determination by the court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contents of agreement. An agreement made pursuant to this section shall be so designated in the heading of the agreement, and it shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the amount of the tax determined for the open taxable year to which the agreement relates, and if said liability is established or altered by a document executed concurrently with the execution of the agreement, a reference to said document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A concise statement of the material facts with respect to the item that was the subject of the error in the closed taxable year or years, and a statement of the manner in which such item was treated in computing the tax liability set forth pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A statement as to the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to Sec. 1.1314(a)-1 for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made and, where applicable, a statement as to the amount of the adjustment or adjustments ascertained pursuant to Sec. 1.1314(a)-2 with respect to any other taxable year or years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of any deficiencies set forth pursuant to subparagraph 3 of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Execution and effect of agreement. An agreement made pursuant to this section shall be signed by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made, or on the taxpayer's behalf by an agent or attorney acting pursuant to a power of attorney on file with the Internal Revenue Service. If an adjustment is to be made in a case of a related taxpayer, the agreement shall be signed also by the related taxpayer, or on the related taxpayer's behalf by an agent or attorney acting pursuant to a power of attorney on file with the Internal Revenue Service. It may be signed on behalf of the Commissioner by the district director, or such other person as is authorized by the Commissioner. When duly executed, such agreement will constitute the authority for an allowance of any

refund or credit agreed to therein, and for the immediate assessment of any deficiency agreed to therein for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made, or any closed taxable year or years affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryover determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Finality of determination. A determination made by an agreement pursuant to this section becomes final when the tax liability for the open taxable year to which the determination relates becomes final. During the period, if any, that a deficiency may be assessed or a refund or credit allowed with respect to such year, either the taxpayer or the Commissioner may properly pursue any of the procedures provided by law to secure a further modification of the tax liability for such year. For example, if the taxpayer subsequently files a claim for refund, or if the Commissioner subsequently issues a notice of deficiency with respect to such year, either may adopt a position with respect to the item that was the subject of the adjustment that is at variance with the manner in which said item was treated in the agreement. Any assessment, refund, or credit that is subsequently made with respect to the tax liability for such open taxable year, to the extent that it is based upon a revision in the treatment of the item that was the subject of the adjustment, shall constitute an alteration or revocation of the determination for the purpose of a redetermination of the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1314(b)-1.

Sec. 1.1313(c)-1  Related taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">An adjustment in the case of the taxpayer with respect to whom the error was made may be authorized under section 1311 although the determination is made with respect to a different taxpayer, provided that such taxpayers stand in one of the relationships specified in section 1313(c). The concept of related taxpayer has application to all of the circumstances of adjustment specified in Sec. 1.1312-1 through Sec. 1.1312-5 if the related taxpayer is one described in section 1313(c); it has application to the circumstances of adjustment specified in Sec. 1.1312-6 only if the related taxpayer is one described in section 1313(c)(7); it does not apply in the circumstances specified in Sec. 1.1312-7. If such relationship exists, it is not essential that the error involve a transaction made possible only by reason of the existence of the relationship. For example, if the error with respect to which an adjustment is sought under section 1311 grew out of an assignment of rents between taxpayer A and taxpayer B, who are partners, and the determination is with respect to taxpayer A, an adjustment with respect to taxpayer B may be permissible despite the fact that the assignment had nothing to do with the business of the partnership. The relationship need not exist throughout the entire taxable year with respect to which the error was made, but only at some time during that taxable year. For example, if a taxpayer on February 15 assigns to his fiancee the net rents of a building which the taxpayer owns, and the two are married before the end of the taxable year, an adjustment may be permissible if the determination relates to such rents despite the fact that they were not husband and wife at the time of the assignment. See Sec. 1.1311(b)-3 for the requirement in certain cases that the relationship exist at the time an inconsistent position is first maintained.

Sec. 1.1314(a)-1  Ascertainment of amount of adjustment in year oferror.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In computing the amount of the adjustment under sections 1311 to 1315, inclusive, there must first be ascertained the amount of the tax previously determined for the taxpayer as to whom the error was made for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The tax previously determined for any taxable year may be the amount of tax shown on the taxpayer's return, but if any changes in that amount have been made, they must be taken into account. In such cases, the tax previously determined will be the sum of the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amounts previously assessed

(or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, reduced by the amount of any rebates made. The amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amount of any rebates or deficiencies shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6211 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The tax previously determined may consist of tax for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1931, imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by chapter 1 and subchapters A, B, D, and E of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or by the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, or by any one or more of such provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tax previously determined may consist of tax for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1931, imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by chapter 1 and subchapters A, B, D, and E of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or by the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, or by any one or more of such provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, a recomputation must then be made under the laws applicable to said taxable year to ascertain the increase or decrease in tax, if any, resulting from the correction of the error. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed after correction of the error will be the amount of the adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No change shall be made in the treatment given any item upon which the tax previously determined was based other than in the correction of the item or items with respect to which the error was made. However, due regard shall be given to the effect that such correction may have on the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under chapter 1 of the Code. If the treatment of any item upon which the tax previously determined was based, or if the application of any provisions of the internal revenue laws with respect to such tax, depends upon the amount of income (e.g. charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, dividends received credit, medical expenses, and percentage depletion), readjustment in these particulars will be necessary as part of the recomputation in conformity with the change in the amount of the income which results from the correct treatment of the item or items in respect of which the error was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any interest or additions to the tax collected as a result of the error shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: (1) For the taxable year 1949 a taxpayer with no dependents, who kept his books on the cash receipts and disbursements method, filed a joint return with his wife disclosing adjusted gross income of $42,000 deductions amounting to $12,000, and a net income of $30,000. Included among other items in the gross income were salary in the amount of $15,000 and rents accrued but not yet received in the amount of $5,000. During the taxable year he donated $10,000 to the American Red Cross and in his return claimed a deduction of $6,300 on account thereof, representing the maximum deduction allowable under the 15-percent limitation imposed by section 23(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as applicable to the year 1949. In computing his net income he omitted interest income amounting to $6,000 and neglected to take a deduction for interest paid in the amount of $4,500. The return disclosed a tax liability of $7,788, which was assessed and paid. After the expiration of the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency or the allowance of a refund for 1949, the Commissioner included the item of rental income amounting to $5,000 in the taxpayer's gross income for the year 1950 and asserted a deficiency for that year. As a result of a final decision of the Tax Court of the United States in 1955 sustaining the deficiency for 1950, an adjustment is authorized for the year 1949.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the adjustment is computed as follows:
Tax previously determined for 1949..........................      $7,788</p><p class="depth0">===========Net income for 1949 upon which tax previously determined was      30,000</p><p class="depth0">based......................................................Less: Rents erroneously included............................       5,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Balance.................................................      25,000Adjustment for contributions (add 15 percent of $5,000).....         750</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Net income as adjusted..................................      25,750</p><p class="depth0">===========Tax as recomputed...........................................       6,152Tax previously determined...................................       7,788</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Difference..............................................       1,636Amount of adjustment to be refunded or credited.............       1,636</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the recomputation to determine the amount of the adjustment does not take into consideration the item of $6,000 representing interest received, which was omitted from gross income, or the item of $4,500 representing interest paid, for which no deduction was allowed.

Sec. 1.1314(a)-2  Adjustment to other barred taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An adjustment is authorized under section 1311 with respect to a taxable year or years other than the year of the error, but only if all of the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tax liability for such other year or years must be affected, or must have been treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in section 172) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in section 1212).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover must be determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> On the date of the determination the adjustment with respect to such other year or years must be prevented by some law or rule of law, other than sections 1311 through 1315 and section 7122 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the adjustment for such other year or years shall be computed in a manner similar to that provided in Sec. 1.1314(a)-1. The tax previously determined for such other year or years shall be ascertained. A recomputation must then be made to ascertain the increase or decrease in tax, if any, resulting solely from the correction of the net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed is the amount of the adjustment. In the recomputation, no consideration shall be given to items other than the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The items upon which the tax previously determined for such other year or years was based, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover as corrected.
In determining the correct net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover, no changes shall be made in taxable income (net income in the case of taxable years subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue laws), net operating loss or capital loss, for any barred taxable year, except as provided in section 1314. Section 172 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, prescribe the methods of computing the net operating loss deduction. Section 1212 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, prescribe the methods for computing the capital loss carryback and carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A net operating loss deduction or a capital loss carryback or carryover determined with reference to the year of the error may affect, or may have been treated as affecting, a taxable year with respect to which an adjustment is not prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law. In such case, the appropriate adjustment shall be made with respect to such open taxable year. However, the redetermination of the tax for such open taxable year is not made pursuant to part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, and the adjustment for such open year and the method of computation are not limited by the provisions of said sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: The taxpayer is a corporation which makes its income tax returns on a calendar year basis. Its net income in 1949, computed without any net operating loss deduction was $10,000, but because of a net operating loss deduction in excess of that amount resulting from a carryback of a net operating loss claimed for 1950, it paid no income tax for 1949. On its return for 1950 it showed an excess of deductions over gross income of $14,000, and it paid no income tax for 1950. For the year 1951 its net income, computed without any net operating loss deduction, was $15,000, and a net operating loss deduction of $13,000 was allowed ($4,000 of which was attributable to the carryover from 1950 and $9,000 of which was attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss of $9,000 sustained in 1952). In 1957 the assessment of deficiencies or the allowance of refunds for all of said years are barred by the statute of limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Tax Court decision entered in 1957 with respect to the taxable year 1953 constituted a determination under which an adjustment is authorized to the taxable year 1950, the year with respect to which the error was made. This adjustment increases income for said year by $15,000, so that instead of a net operating loss of $14,000, its corrected net

income is $1,000 for 1950, and the tax computed on that income will be assessed as a deficiency for 1950. An adjustment is authorized under this section with respect to each of the years 1949 and 1951, as the tax liability for each year was treated as affected by a net operating loss deduction which was determined by a computation in which reference was made to the year 1950. In the recomputation of the tax for 1949, the net operating loss carryback from 1950 will be eliminated, and in the recomputation of the tax for 1951 the net operating loss carryover from 1950 will be eliminated; for each of the years 1949 and 1951 there will be an adjustment which will be treated as a deficiency for said year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assuming the same facts, except that the correction with respect to the year 1950 increases the net operating loss for said year from $14,000 to $20,000. As a result of this correction, there will be no change in the tax due for 1949 and 1950. However, the net operating loss deduction for 1951 is recomputed to be $19,000, the aggregate of the $10,000 carryover from 1950 and the $9,000 carryback from 1952 (the carryover from 1950 is the excess of the $20,000 net operating loss for 1950 over the $10,000 net income for 1949, such 1949 income being determined without any net operating loss deduction). As a result of the correction of the net operating loss deduction for 1951, the tax recomputation will show no tax due for said year, and the adjustment for 1951 will result in a refund or credit of the tax previously paid. Moreover, computations resulting from this adjustment will disclose a net operating loss carryover from 1952 to 1953 of $4,000, that is, the excess of the $9,000 net operating loss for 1952 over the $5,000 net income for 1951 (such net income for 1951 being computed as the $15,000 reduced by the carryover of $10,000 from 1950, the carryback from 1952 not being taken into account). A further adjustment is authorized under section 1311 with respect to any subsequent barred year in which the tax liability is affected by a carryover of the net operating loss from 1952, inasmuch as such carryover from 1952 has been determined by a computation in which reference was made to 1950, the taxable year of the error.

Sec. 1.1314(b)-1  Method of adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to Sec. 1.1314(a)-1 or Sec. 1.1314(a)-2 represents an increase in tax, it is to be treated as if it were a deficiency determined by the Commissioner with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made and for the taxable year or years with respect to which such adjustment was made. The amount of such adjustment is thus to be assessed and collected under the law and regulations applicable to the assessment and collection of deficiencies, subject, however, to the limitations imposed by Sec. 1.1314(c)-1. Notice of deficiency, unless waived, must be issued with respect to such amount or amounts, and the taxpayer may contest the deficiency before the Tax Court of the United States or, if he chooses, may pay the deficiency and later file claim for refund. If the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to Sec. 1.1314(a)-1 or Sec. 1.1314(a)-2 represents a decrease in tax, it is to be treated as if it were an overpayment claimed by the taxpayer with respect to whom the error was made for the taxable year or years with respect to which such adjustment was made. Such amount may be recovered under the law and regulations applicable to overpayments of tax, subject, however, to the limitations imposed by Sec. 1.1314(c)-1. The taxpayer must file a claim for refund thereof, unless the overpayment is refunded without such claim, and if the claim is denied or not acted upon by the Commissioner within the prescribed time, the taxpayer may then file suit for refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of the adjustments authorized by section 1311, the period of limitations upon the making of an assessment or upon refund or credit, as the case may be, for the taxable year of an adjustment shall be considered as if, on the date of the determination, one year remained before the expiration of such period. The Commissioner thus has one year from the date of the determination within which to mail a notice of deficiency in respect of the amount of the adjustment where such adjustment is treated as if it were a deficiency. The issuance of such notice of deficiency, in accordance with the law and regulations applicable to the assessment of deficiencies will suspend the running of the 1-year period of limitations provided in section 1314(b). In accordance with the applicable law and regulations governing the collection of deficiencies, the period of limitation for collection of the amount of the adjustment will commence to run from the date of assessment of such amount. (See section 6502 and corresponding provisions of

prior revenue laws.) Similarly, the taxpayer has a period of one year from the date of the determination within which to file a claim for refund in respect of the amount of the adjustment where such adjustment is treated as if it were an overpayment. Where the amount of the adjustment is treated as if it were a deficiency and the taxpayer chooses to pay such deficiency and contest it by way of a claim for refund, the period of limitation upon filing a claim for refund will commence to run from the date of such payment. See section 6511 and corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of an adjustment treated as if it were a deficiency or an overpayment, as the case may be, will bear interest and be subject to additions to the tax to the extent provided by the internal revenue laws applicable to deficiencies and overpayments for the taxable year with respect to which the adjustment is made. In the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss or net capital loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, as a result of a determination provided for in Sec. 1.1313(a)-4, an adjustment has been made by the assessment and collection of a deficiency or the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under Sec. 1.1314(a)-1 and Sec. 1.1314(a)-2 shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation, and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under section 1311. For the circumstances under which such an agreement can be altered or revoked, see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1313(a)-4.

Sec. 1.1314(c)-1  Adjustment unaffected by other items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount of any adjustment ascertained under Sec. 1.1314(a)-1 or Sec. 1.1314(a)-2 shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In the example set forth in paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1314(a)-1, if, after the amount of the adjustment had been ascertained, the taxpayer, filed a refund claim for the amount thereof, the Commissioner could not diminish the amount of that claim by offsetting against it the amount of tax which should have been paid with respect to the $6,000 interest item omitted from gross income for the year 1949; nor could the court, if suit were brought on such claim for refund, offset against the amount of the adjustment the amount of tax which should have been paid with respect to such interest. Similarly, the amount of the refund could not be increased by any amount attributable to the taxpayer's failure to deduct the $4,500 interest paid in the year 1949.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that a taxpayer included in his gross income for the year 1953 an item which should have been included in his gross income for the year 1952. After the expiration of the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency or the allowance of a refund for 1952, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund for the year 1953 on the ground that such item was not properly includible in gross income for that year. The claim for refund was allowed by the Commissioner and as a result of such determination an adjustment was authorized under section 1311 with respect to the tax for 1952. If, in such case, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency for the amount of the adjustment and the taxpayer contested the deficiency before the Tax Court of the United States, the taxpayer could not in such proceeding claim an offset based upon his failure to take an allowable deduction for the year 1952; nor could the Tax Court in its decision offset against the amount of the adjustment any overpayment for the year 1952 resulting from the failure to take such deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the Commissioner has refunded the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, the amount so refunded may not subsequently be recovered by the Commissioner in any suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment,</p><p class="depth0">Example: In the example set forth in paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1314(a)-1, if the Commissioner had refunded the amount of the adjustment,

no part of the amount so refunded could subsequently be recovered by the Commissioner by a suit for erroneous refund based on the ground that there was no overpayment for 1949, as the taxpayer had failed to include in gross income the $6,000 item of interest received in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the Commissioner has assessed and collected the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, no part thereof may be recovered by the taxpayer in any suit for refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example: In example (2) of paragraph (b) of this section, if the taxpayer had paid the amount of the adjustment, he could not subsequently recover any part of such payment in a suit for refund based upon the failure to take an allowable deduction for the year 1952.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the amount of the adjustment is considered an overpayment, it may be credited, under applicable law and regulations, together with any interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made such overpayment. Likewise, if the amount of the adjustment is considered as a deficiency, any overpayment by the taxpayer of any internal revenue tax may be credited against the amount of such adjustment in accordance with the applicable law and regulations thereunder. (See section 6402 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.) Accordingly, it may be possible in one transaction between the Commissioner and the taxpayer to settle the taxpayer's tax liability for the year with respect to which the determination is made and to make the adjustment under section 1311 for the year with respect to which the error was made or for a year which is affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction or a capital loss carryover from the year of the error.
