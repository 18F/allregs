Such service must be made by  delivering one copy to each party; by email; in-person hand delivery; or  United States mail service, and be properly addressed with postage  prepaid; by courier; or by facsimile. Service should be made in the same  manner in which any pleading or document is filed with the Commission.  For example, if a pleading is filed by email pursuant to Sec.  502.2(f)(3), service should also be made by email.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a party has appeared by attorney or other representative,  service upon each attorney or other representative of record will be  deemed service upon the party, except that, if two or more attorneys of  record are partners or associates of the same firm, only one of them  need be served.</p>
