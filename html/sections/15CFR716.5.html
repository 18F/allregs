Inspections of facilities may be made only upon issuance of written notice by the United States National Authority (USNA) to the owner and to the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be inspected. BIS will also provide a separate inspection notification to the inspection point of contact identified in declarations submitted by the facility. If the United States is unable to provide actual written notice to the owner and to the operator, occupant or agent in charge, BIS (or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, if BIS is unable) may post notice prominently at the facility to be inspected.

In addition to appropriate information provided by the OPCW in its notification to the USNA, BIS's inspection notification will request that the facility indicate whether it will consent to an inspection, and will state whether an advance team is available to assist the site in preparation for the inspection. If an advance team is available, facilities that request advance team assistance are not required to reimburse the U.S. Government for costs associated with these activities. If a facility does not agree to provide consent to an inspection within four hours of receipt of the inspection notification, BIS will seek an administrative warrant. The current owner of a facility, upon receiving notification of an inspection, is also responsible for informing BIS if the previous owner did not transfer (to the current owner) records for activities that took place under the previous ownership (see Sec. 716.4(e) of the CWCR)--this will allow BIS to contact the previous owner of the facility, to arrange for access to such records, if BIS deems them relevant to the inspection activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following table sets forth the notification procedures for inspection:</p><p class="depth0">Table to Sec. 716.5(a)(1)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> OPCW notification inspection  (1) U.S. National   Acknowledges</p><p class="depth0">Authority           receipt of</p><p class="depth0">transmits actual    facsimile.</p><p class="depth0">written notice</p><p class="depth0">and inspection</p><p class="depth0">authorization to</p><p class="depth0">the owner and</p><p class="depth0">operator,</p><p class="depth0">occupant, or</p><p class="depth0">agent in charge</p><p class="depth0">via facsimile</p><p class="depth0">within 6 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon            (A) Indicated</p><p class="depth0">notification from   whether it grants</p><p class="depth0">the U.S. National   consent.</p><p class="depth0">Authority, BIS     (B) May request</p><p class="depth0">immediately         advance team</p><p class="depth0">transmits           support.

For a declared Schedule 1 facility, the Convention does not specify a maximum duration for an initial inspection. The estimated period of routine inspections will be as stated in the facility agreement, unless extended by agreement between the Inspection Team and the Host Team Leader, and will be based on the risk to the object and purpose of the Convention posed by the quantities of chemicals produced, the characteristics of the facility and the nature of the activities carried out there. The Host Team Leader will consult with the inspected facility on any request for extension of an inspection prior to making an agreement with the Inspection Team. Activities involving the pre-inspection briefing and preliminary findings are in addition to inspection activities.
