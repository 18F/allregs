                            <p class="depth0">If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order, FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The detention order under Sec. 1.393, rather than the notice under Sec. 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative

record of the regulatory hearing under Sec. 16.80(a) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for a hearing under this section must be addressed to the FDA District Director in whose district the article of food involved is located;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provision in Sec. 16.22(b) of this chapter, providing that a person not be given less than 3 working days after receipt of notice to request a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provision in Sec. 16.24(e) of this chapter, stating that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 1.406, rather than Sec. 16.24(f) of this chapter, describes the statement that will be provided to an appellant where a detention order is based on classified information;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Section 1.404, rather than Sec. 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees, e.g., Regional Food and Drug Directors or other officials senior to a District Director, who preside at hearings under this subpart;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under this section be completed within 1 calendar day, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart.

With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the administrative record of the hearing specified in Sec. Sec. 16.80(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(5), and 1.403(i) constitutes the exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision on an administrative detention. For purposes of judicial review under Sec. 10.45 of this chapter, the record of the administrative proceeding consists of the record of the hearing and the presiding officer's final decision.</p>
