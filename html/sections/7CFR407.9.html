Conformity to Food Security Act</p><p class="depth0">Although your violation of a number of federal statutes, including the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Your insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> We will recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for expenses and handling equal to 20 percent of the premium paid or to be paid by you.</p><p class="depth0">27. Applicability of State and Local Statutes</p><p class="depth0">If the provisions of this policy conflict with statutes of the State or locality in which this policy is issued, the policy provisions will prevail.

Examples</p><p class="depth0">The following are examples of the calculation of the premium, amount of insurance and indemnity for each of the three plans of insurance under ARPI. Your information will likely be different and you should consult the actuarial documents in your county and the policy information. The following facts are for illustration purposes only and apply to each of the examples.</p><p class="depth0">Producer A farms 100 acres in county X and has a 100 percent share, or 1.000, in those acres. From the actuarial documents in county X, Producer A elects the 75 percent coverage level and a protection factor of 110 percent or 1.10. The actuarial documents in county X also show that the expected county yield is 141.4 bushels per acre, the projected price is $4.00, and the expected county revenue is $565.60. The subsidy factor for the 75 percent coverage level is .55 for revenue coverage and .59 for yield coverage. The loss limit factor is 18 percent or .18. At the end of the insurance period, for county X, FCIC releases a harvest price of $4.57 and a final county yield for county X of 75.0 bushels.</p><p class="depth0">The premium rate is based on the published volatility factor and for this example is .0166 for Area Revenue Protection, .0146 for Area Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion, and .0116 for Area Yield Protection.</p><p class="depth0">Area Revenue Protection example:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1: Calculate the Dollar Amount of Insurance per Acre
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times protection factor equals dollar amount of insurance141.4 bushels x $4.00 x 1.1 = $622.16 dollar amount of insurance per</p><p class="depth0">acre</p><p class="depth0">Step 2: Calculate the Policy Protection
Formula: Dollar amount of insurance per acre times acres times share equals policy protection$622.16 x 100.0 x 1.000 = $62,216 policy protection</p><p class="depth0">Step 3: Calculate the Total Premium
Formula: Policy protection times premium rate equals total premium$62,216 x .0166 = $1,033 total premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy$1,033 x .55 = $568 subsidy</p><p class="depth0">Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium$1,033 - $568 = $465 producer premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Formula: Expected county yield times (greater of projected price or harvest price) times protection factor times acres times share equals Final Policy Protection141.4 bushels x $4.57 x 1.10 x 100.0 x 1.000 = $71,082 final policy</p><p class="depth0">protection</p><p class="depth0">Step 7: Calculate the Final County Revenue
Formula: Final county yield times harvest price equals final county revenue75.0 bushels x $4.57 = $342.75 final county revenue</p><p class="depth0">Step 8: Calculate the Trigger Revenue
Formula: Expected county yield times (greater of projected price or harvest price) times coverage level equals trigger revenue141.4 bushels x $4.57 x .75 = $484.65 trigger revenue</p><p class="depth0">Step 9: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger revenue minus final county revenue) divided by (trigger revenue minus (expected county yield times the greater of projected or harvest price times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor($484.65 - $342.75) / ($484.65-(141.4 x $4.57 x .18)) = .385 payment</p><p class="depth0">factor</p><p class="depth0">Step 10: Calculate the Indemnity
Formula: Final policy protection times payment factor equals indemnity$71,082 x .385 = $27,367 indemnity</p><p class="depth0">Area Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion example:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1: Calculate the Dollar Amount of Insurance per Acre

Formula: Dollar amount of insurance per acre times acres times share equals policy protection$622.16 x 100.0 x 1.000 = $62,216 policy protection</p><p class="depth0">Step 3: Calculate the Total Premium
Formula: Policy protection times rate equals total premium$62,216 x .0146 rate = $908 total premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy Amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy$908 x .55 = $499 subsidy</p><p class="depth0">Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium$908 - $499 = $409 producer premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Use the policy protection amount calculated at the beginning of the insurance period in Step 2$62,216 policy protection</p><p class="depth0">Step 7: Calculate the Final County Revenue
Formula: Final county yield times harvest price equals final county revenue75.0 bushels x $4.57 = $342.75 final county revenue</p><p class="depth0">Step 8: Calculate the Trigger Revenue
Formula: Expected county yield times projected price times coverage level equals trigger revenue141.4 bushels x $4.00 x .75 = $424.20 trigger revenue</p><p class="depth0">Step 9: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger revenue minus final county revenue) divided by (trigger revenue minus (expected county yield times projected price times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor($424.20 - $342.75) / ($424.20 - (141.4 x $4.00 x .18)) = .253</p><p class="depth0">Step 10: Calculate the Indemnity

Formula: policy protection times premium rate equals total premium$62,216 x .0116 rate = $722 total premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 4: Calculate the Subsidy amount
Formula: Total premium times subsidy factor equals subsidy$722 x .59 subsidy factor = $426 subsidy</p><p class="depth0">Step 5: Calculate the Producer Premium
Formula: Total premium minus subsidy equals producer premium$722 - $426 = $296 producer premium</p><p class="depth0">Step 6: Calculate the Final Policy Protection
Use the policy protection amount calculated at the beginning of the insurance period in Step 2$62,216 policy protection</p><p class="depth0">Step 7: Calculate the Trigger Yield
Formula: Expected county yield times coverage level equals trigger yield141.4 bushels times .75 = 106.1 bushels</p><p class="depth0">Step 8: Calculate the Payment Factor
Formula: (Trigger yield minus final county yield) divided by (trigger yield minus (expected county yield times loss limit factor)) equals payment factor(106.1 bushels - 75.0 bushels) / (106.1 bushels - (141.4 bushels x .18))</p><p class="depth0">= .386</p><p class="depth0">Step 9: Calculate the Indemnity
