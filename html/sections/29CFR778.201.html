the Act are outlined in section 7(e) (5), (6), and (7) of the Act as set forth in Sec. 778.200(a). These are discussed in detail in the sections following.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 7(h) of the Act specifically states that the extra compensation provided by these three types of payments may be credited toward overtime compensation due under section 7(a) for work in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard.
