At or following the conclusion of a pre-decision conference, the Administrative Law Judge may serve a pre-decision memorandum and order setting forth the agreements reached by the parties, any procedural determinations made by him, and the issues for resolution not disposed of by admissions or agreements by the parties. Such an order shall control the subsequent course of the proceeding unless modified to prevent injustice.
