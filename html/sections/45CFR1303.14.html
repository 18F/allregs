                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After receiving concurrence from the Commissioner, ACYF, the responsible HHS official may terminate financial assistance to a grantee. Financial assistance may be terminated in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial assistance may be terminated for any or all of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The grantee is no longer financially viable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The grantee has lost the requisite legal status or permits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The grantee has failed to comply with the required fiscal or program reporting requirements applicable to grantees in the Head Start program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The grantee has failed to timely correct one or more deficiencies as defined in 45 CFR Part 1304;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The grantee has failed to comply with the eligibility requirements and limitations on enrollment in the Head Start program, or both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The grantee has failed to comply with the Head Start grants administration requirements set forth in 45 CFR part 1301;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The grantee has failed to comply with the requirements of the Head Start Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The grantee is debarred from receiving Federal grants or contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The grantee fails to abide by any other terms and conditions of its award of financial assistance, or any other applicable laws, regulations, or other applicable Federal or State requirements or policies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A notice of termination shall set forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The legal basis for the termination under paragraph (b) of this section, the factual findings on which the termination is based or reference to specific findings in another document that form the basis for the termination (such as reference to item numbers in an on-site review report or instrument), and citation to any statutory provisions, regulations, or policy issuances on which ACF is relying for its determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fact that the termination may be appealed within 30 days to the Departmental Appeals Board (with a

copy of the appeal sent to the responsible HHS official and the Commissioner, ACYF) and that such appeal shall be governed by 45 CFR part 16, except as otherwise provided in the Head Start appeals regulations, and that any grantee that requests a hearing shall be afforded one, as mandated by 42. U.S.C. 9841.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the appeal may be made only by the Board of Directors of the grantee or an official acting on behalf of such Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That, if the activities of a delegate agency are the basis, in whole or in part, for the proposed termination, the identity of the delegate agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the grantee's appeal must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That a failure by the responsible HHS official to meet the requirements of this paragraph may result in the dismissal of the termination action without prejudice, or the remand of that action for the purpose of reissuing it with the necessary corrections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A grantee's appeal must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specifically identify what factual findings are disputed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify any legal issues raised, including relevant citations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include an original and two copies of each document the grantee believes is relevant and supportive of its position (unless the grantee has obtained permission from the Departmental Appeals Board to submit fewer copies);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include any request for specifically identified documents the grantee wishes to obtain from ACF and a statement of the relevance of the requested documents, and a statement that the grantee has attempted informally to obtain the documents from ACF and was unable to do so;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Grantees may submit additional documents within 14 days of receipt of the documentation submitted by ACF in response to the grantee's appeal and initial submittals. The ACF response to the appeal and initial submittals of the grantee shall be filed no later than 30 days after ACF's receipt of the material. In response to such a submittal, ACF may submit additional documents should it have any, or request discovery in connection with the new documents, or both, but must do so within 10 days of receipt of the additional filings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Include a statement on whether the grantee is requesting a hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Be filed with the Departmental Appeals Board and be served on the responsible HHS official who issued the termination notice and on the Commissioner of ACYF. The grantee must also serve a copy of the appeal on any delegate agency that would be financially affected at the time the grantee files its appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Departmental Appeals Board sanctions with respect to a grantee's failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If in the judgment of the Departmental Appeals Board a grantee has failed to substantially comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section, its appeal must be dismissed with prejudice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Departmental Appeals Board concludes that the grantee's failures are not substantial, but are confined to one or a few specific instances, it shall bar the submittal of an omitted document, or preclude the raising of an argument or objection not timely raised in the appeal, or deny a request for a document or other ``discovery'' request not timely made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sanctions set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply if the Departmental Appeals Board determines that the grantee has shown good cause for its failure to comply with the relevant requirements. Delays in obtaining representation shall not constitute good cause. Matters within the control of its agents and attorneys shall be deemed to be within the control of the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> (1) During a grantee's appeal of a termination decision, funding will continue until an adverse decision is rendered or until expiration of the then current budget period. At the end of the current budget period, if a decision has not been rendered, the responsible HHS official shall award an interim grant to the grantee until a decision is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During a grantee's appeal of a termination decision, funding will continue until an adverse decision is rendered or until expiration of the then current budget period. At the end of the current budget period, if a decision has not been rendered, the responsible HHS official shall award an interim grant to the grantee until a decision is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a grantee's funding has been suspended, no funding shall be available during the termination proceedings, or at any other time, unless the action is rescinded or the grantee's appeal is successful. An interim grantee will be appointed during the appeal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a grantee does not appeal an administrative decision to court within 30 days of its receipt of the decision, a replacement grantee will be immediately sought. An interim grantee may be named, if needed, pending the selection of a replacement grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An interim grantee may be sought even though the grantee has appealed an administrative decision to court within 30 days, if the responsible HHS official determines it necessary to do so. Examples of circumstances that warrant an interim grantee are to protect children and families from harm and Federal funds from misuse or dissipation or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the Departmental Appeals Board informs a grantee that a proposed termination action has been set down for hearing, the grantee shall, within five days of its receipt of this notice, send a copy of it to all delegate agencies which would be financially affected by the termination and to each delegate agency identified in the notice. The grantee shall send the Departmental Appeals Board and the responsible HHS official a list of all delegate agencies notified and the dates of notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the responsible HHS official initiated termination proceedings because of the activities of a delegate agency, that delegate agency may participate in the hearing as a matter of right. Any other delegate agency, person, agency or organization that wishes to participate in the hearing may request permission to do so from the Departmental Appeals Board. Any request for participation, including a request by a delegate agency, must be filed within 30 days of the grantee's appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The results of the proceeding and any measure taken thereafter by ACYF pursuant to this part shall be fully binding upon the grantee and all its delegate agencies, whether or not they actually participated in the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A grantee may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. Such material shall be submitted within a reasonable period of time to be fixed by the Departmental Appeals Board upon the request of the grantee. The failure of a grantee to request a hearing, or to appear at a hearing for which a date had been set, unless excused for good cause, shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of written information and argument submitted by the parties to the Departmental Appeals Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The responsible HHS official may attempt, either personally or through a representative, to resolve the issues in dispute by informal means prior to the hearing.
