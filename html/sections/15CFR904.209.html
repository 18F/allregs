                            <p class="depth0">In the interests of justice and administrative efficiency, the  Judge, on his or her own initiative or upon the application of any  party, may expedite the administrative proceeding. A motion by a party  to expedite the administrative proceeding may, at the discretion of the  Judge, be made orally or in writing with concurrent actual notice to all  parties. Upon granting a motion to expedite the scheduling of an  administrative proceeding, the Judge may expedite pleading schedules,  prehearing conferences and the hearing, as appropriate. If a motion for  an expedited administrative proceeding is granted, a hearing on the  merits may not be scheduled with less than 5 business days notice,  unless all parties consent to an earlier hearing.</p>
