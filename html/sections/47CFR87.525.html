                            <p class="depth0">Automatic weather observation stations (AWOS) and automatic surface observation stations (ASOS) must provide up-to-date weather information including the time of the latest weather sequence, altimeter setting, wind speed and direction, dew point, temperature, visibility and other pertinent data needed at airports having neither a full-time control tower nor a full-time FAA Flight Service Station. When a licensee has entered into an agreement with the FAA, an AWOS or an ASOS may also operate as an automatic terminal information station (ATIS) during the control tower's operating hours.
