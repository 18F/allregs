                                Sec. 1209.30  Request for document discovery from parties.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Each request for the production of documents must  conform to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitations. Subject to applicable limitations on discovery in  this part, a party may serve (requesting party) a request on another  party (responding party) for the production of any non-privileged,  discoverable documents in the possession, custody, or control of the  responding party. A requesting party shall serve a copy of any such  document request on all other parties. Each request for the production  of documents must, with reasonable particularity, identify or describe  the documents to be produced, either by individual item or by category,  with sufficient specificity to enable the responding party to respond  consistent with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discovery plan. Document discovery under subpart C of this part  shall be consistent with any discovery plan approved by the presiding  officer under Sec. 1209.29.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Production and costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Subject to the applicable  limitations on discovery in this part and the discovery plan, the  requesting party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for  the production of documents and the performance of any related acts. The  responding party shall produce documents to the requesting party in a  manner consistent with the discovery plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs. All costs associated with document productions-- including, without limitation, photocopying (as specified in paragraph  (b)(4) of this section) or electronic processing (as specified in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section)--shall be born by the requesting  party, or otherwise in accordance with any discovery plan approved by  the presiding officer that may require such costs be apportioned between  parties, or as otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. If consistent  with the discovery plan approved by the presiding officer, the  responding party may require receipt of payment of any such document  production costs in advance before any such production of responsive  documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Organization. Unless otherwise provided for in any discovery  plan approved by the presiding officer under Sec. 1209.29 of this part,  or by order of the presiding officer, documents must be produced as they  are kept in the usual course of business or they shall be labeled and  organized to correspond with the categories in the document request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Photocopying charges. Photocopying charges are to be set at the  current rate per page imposed by   FHFA under the fee schedule pursuant to Sec. 1202.11(c) of this part  for requests for documents filed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5  U.S.C. 552.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Electronic processing. In the event that any party seeks the  production of electronically stored information (i.e., information  created, stored, communicated, or used in digital format requiring the  use of computer hardware and software), the parties shall confer in good  faith to resolve common discovery issues related to electronically  stored information, such as preservation, search methodology,  collection, and need for such information; the suitability of  alternative means to obtain it; and the format of production. Consistent  with the discovery plan approved by the presiding officer under Sec.  1209.29, costs associated with the processing of such electronic  information (i.e., imaging; scanning; conversion of ``native'' files to  images that are viewable and searchable; indexing; coding; database or  Web-based hosting; searches; branding of endorsements, such as  ``confidential'' or document control numbering; privilege reviews; and  copies of production discs) and delivery of any such document  production, shall be born by the requesting party, apportioned among the  parties, or as otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. Nothing in  this part shall be deemed to require FHFA to produce privileged  documents or any electronic records in violation of applicable Federal  law or security protocols.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obligation to update responses. A party who has responded to a  discovery request is not required to supplement the response, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responding party learns that in some material respect the  information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The additional or corrective information has not otherwise been  made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Motions to strike or limit discovery requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party  served with a document discovery request may object within 30 days of  service of the request by filing a motion to strike or limit the request  in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1209.28 of this part. No  other party may file an objection. If an objection is made only to a  portion of an item or category in a request, the objection shall specify  that portion. Any objections not made in accordance with this paragraph  and Sec. 1209.28 are waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion  to strike or limit may file a written response in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1209.28. A reply by the moving party, if any, shall  be governed by Sec. 1209.28. No other party may file a response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Privilege. At the time other documents are produced, all  documents withheld on a claim of privilege must be reasonably  identified, together with a statement of the basis for the assertion of  privilege on a privilege log. When similar documents that are protected  by the government's deliberative process, investigative or examination  privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or the attorney-client  privilege are voluminous, such documents may be identified on the log by  category instead of by individual document. The presiding officer has  discretion to permit submission of a privilege log subsequent to the  document production(s), which may occur on a rolling basis if agreed to  by the parties in the discovery plan, and to determine whether an  identification by category is sufficient to provide notice of withheld  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Motions to compel production. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a party withholds any  document as privileged or fails to comply fully with a document  discovery request, the requesting party may, within 10 days of the  assertion of privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes  known to the requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1209.28 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling  the production of any such document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with  the request may, within five days of service of a motion for the  issuance of a subpoena compelling production, file a written response to  the motion. No other party may file a response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ruling on motions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate protective orders. After the  time for filing a response to a motion to compel pursuant to this  section has expired,   the presiding officer shall rule promptly on any such motion. The  presiding officer may deny, grant in part, or otherwise modify any  request for the production of documents, if he determines that a  discovery request, or any one or more of its terms, seeks to obtain the  production of documents that are privileged or otherwise not within the  scope of permissible discovery under Sec. 1209.29(b), and may issue  appropriate protective orders, upon such conditions as justice may  require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No stay. The pendency of a motion to strike or limit discovery,  or to compel the production of any document, shall not stay or continue  the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the presiding officer  may not release, or order any party to produce, any document withheld on  the basis of privilege, if the withholding party has stated to the  presiding officer its intention to file with the Director a timely  motion for interlocutory review of the presiding officer's privilege  determination or order to produce the documents, until the Director has  rendered a decision on the motion for interlocutory review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interlocutory review by the Director. Interlocutory review of a  privilege determination or document discovery subpoena of the presiding  officer shall be in accordance with Sec. 1209.33. To the extent  necessary to rule promptly on such matters, the Director may request  that the presiding officer provide additional information from the  record. As provided by Sec. 1209.33 of this part, a pending  interlocutory review of a privilege determination or document discovery  subpoena shall not stay the proceedings, unless otherwise ordered by the  presiding officer or the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Enforcement of document discovery subpoenas.(1) Authority. If  the presiding officer or Director issues a subpoena compelling  production of documents by a party in a proceeding under this part, in  the event of noncompliance with the subpoena and to the extent  authorized by section 1379D(c)(1) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12  U.S.C. 4641(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>, the Director or the subpoenaing party may apply to  the appropriate United States district court for an order requiring  compliance with the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>, the appropriate United States district court has the  jurisdiction and power to order and to require compliance with any  discovery subpoena issued under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No stay; sanctions. The judicial enforcement of a discovery  subpoena shall not operate as a stay of the proceedings, unless the  presiding officer or the Director orders a stay of such duration as the  presiding officer or Director may find reasonable and in the best  interest of the parties or as justice may require. A party's right to  seek judicial enforcement of a subpoena shall not in any manner limit  the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer or Director  against a party who fails to produce or induces another to fail to  produce subpoenaed documents.</p>
