The term does not include economic poisons subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act or drugs, devices, or cosmetics subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The standard referred to in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section applies to art materials intended for users of any age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each producer or repackager of art materials shall describe in writing the criteria used to determine whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects. Each producer or repackager shall submit, to the Commission's Division of Regulatory Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, the written description of the criteria described above and a list of art materials that require hazard warning labels under this section. Upon request of the Commission, a producer or repackager shall submit to the Commission product formulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All art materials that require chronic hazard labeling pursuant to this section must include on the label the name and United States address of the producer or repackager of the art materials, an appropriate United States telephone number that can be contacted for more information on the hazards requiring warning labels under this section, and a statement that such art materials are inappropriate for use by children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If an art material producer or repackager becomes newly aware of any significant information regarding the hazards of an art material or ways to protect against the hazard, this new information must be incorporated into the labels of such art materials that are manufactured after 12 months from the date of discovery. If a producer or repackager reformulates an art material, the new formulation must be evaluated and labeled in accordance with the standard set forth Sec. 1500.14(b)(8)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In determining whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects, including carcinogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, the toxicologist to whom the substance is referred under the standard described above shall take into account opinions of various regulatory agencies and scientific bodies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to the LHAMA, the Commission has issued guidelines which, where possible, specify criteria for determining when any customary or reasonably foreseeable use of an art material can result in a chronic hazard. These guidelines include criteria for determining when art materials may produce chronic adverse effects in children and adults, criteria for determining which substances contained in art materials have the potential for producing chronic adverse effects and what those effects are, criteria for determining the bioavailability of chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials when the products are used in a customary or reasonably foreseeable manner, and criteria for determining acceptable daily intake levels for chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials. Because these guidelines apply to hazardous substances in general as well as to hazardous substances in art materials, the guidelines are set forth in Sec. 1500.135 and a definition of ``chronic toxicity'' is provided in Sec. 1500.3(c)(2)(ii) as part of supplementation of the term ``toxic'' in section 2(q) of the FHSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Policies and interpretations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of enforcement policy, the Commission will not consider as sufficient grounds for bringing an enforcement action under the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (``LHAMA'') the failure of the following types of products to meet the requirements of Sec. 1500.14(b)(8) (i) through (iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Products whose intended general use is not to create art (e.g., common wood pencils, and single colored pens, markers, and chalk), unless the particular product is specifically packaged, promoted, or marketed in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that it is intended for use as an art material. Factors the Commission would consider in making this determination are how an item is packaged (e.g., packages of multiple colored pencils, chalks, or markers unless promoted for non-art materials uses are likely to be art materials), how it is marketed and promoted (e.g., pencils and pens intended specifically for sketching and drawing are likely to be art materials), and where it is sold (e.g., products sold in an art supply store are likely to be art materials). The products described in this paragraph do not meet the statutory definition of ``art material.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tools, implements, and furniture used in the creation of a work of art such as brushes, chisels, easels, picture frames, drafting tables and chairs, canvas stretchers, potter's wheels, hammers, air pumps for air brushes, kilns, and molds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Surface materials upon which an art material is applied, such as coloring books and canvas, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The following materials whether used as a surface or applied to one, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled: paper, cloth, plastics, films, yarn, threads, rubber, sand, wood, stone, tile, masonry, and metal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of LHAMA enforcement policy, the Commission will enforce against materials including, but not limited to, paints, crayons, colored pencils, glues, adhesives, and putties, if such materials are sold as part of an art, craft, model, or hobby kit. The Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against paints or other materials sold separately which are intended to decorate art, craft, model, and hobby items. Adhesives, glues, and putties intended for general repair or construction uses are not subject to LHAMA. However, the Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against adhesives, glues, and putties sold separately (not part of a kit) if they are intended for art and craft and model construction uses. This paragraph (b)(8)(iv)(B) applies to products introduced into interstate commerce on or after August 14, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Commission regulations at Sec. 1500.14(b)(8)(i)(C)(7) require that a statement of conformance appear with art materials that have been reviewed in accordance with the Commission standard. The Commission interprets this provision to require a conformance statement regardless of the presence of any chronic hazard warnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Nothing in this enforcement statement should be deemed to alter any of the requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (``FHSA''), such as, but not limited to, the requirement that any hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for household use must be labeled in accordance with section 2(p) of the FHSA.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec. 1500.14(b)(8)--Guidelines for a Certifying</p><p class="depth0">Organization (Not Mandatory)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term ``certifying organization,'' as used in this paragraph, refers to an organization or an institute that, after assuring that all provisions are met, certifies that an art material does conform to the labeling requirements of this practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The certifying body may be funded by member manufacturers, but should include users or their representatives, as well as manufacturers' chemists, on its technical and certifying committees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Representative samples of art materials, labeled as conforming to this section

and bought at retail, should be analyzed at random and from time to time by an analytical laboratory to ensure they are the same as the formulation used by the toxicologist(s) for determining labeling requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The methods used by the toxicologist(s) in review and determination of the need and content of precautionary labeling for potentially chronic adverse health effects should be periodically reviewed by an advisory board composed of not less than three or more than five toxicologists, at least one of whom is certified in toxicology by a nationally recognized certification board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In cases where there is disagreement by participating producers or participating users, with the determination of the toxicologist(s), there should be a method whereby the toxicologist's decision can be presented to the advisory board of toxicologists for arbitration.
