                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The proposed resource management plan or revision shall be submitted by the Field Manager to the State Director for supervisory review and approval. When the review is completed the State Director shall either publish the proposed plan and file the related environmental impact statement or return the plan to the Field Manager with a written statement of the problems to be resolved before the proposed plan can be published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No earlier than 30 days after the Environmental Protection Agency publishes a notice of the filing of the final environmental impact statement in the Federal Register, and pending final action on any protest that may be filed, the State Director shall approve the plan. Approval shall be withheld on any portion of a plan or amendment being protested until final action has been completed on such protest. Before such approval is given, there shall be public notice and opportunity for public comment on any significant change made to the proposed plan. The approval shall be documented in a concise public record of the decision, meeting the requirements of regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (40 CFR 1505.2).
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]



Sec. 1610.5-2  Protest procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person who participated in the planning process and has an interest which is or may be adversely affected by the approval or amendment of a resource management plan may protest such approval or amendment. A protest may raise only those issues which were submitted for the record during the planning process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The protest shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Director. The protest shall be filed within 30 days of the date the Environmental Protection Agency published the notice of receipt of the final environmental impact statement containing the plan or amendment in the Federal Register. For an amendment not requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the protest shall be filed within 30 days of the publication of the notice of its effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The protest shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, mailing address, telephone number and interest of the person filing the protest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the issue or issues being protested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement of the part or parts of the plan or amendment being protested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of all documents addressing the issue or issues that were submitted during the planning process by the protesting party or an indication of the date the issue or issues were discussed for the record; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A concise statement explaining why the State Director's decision is believed to be wrong.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Director shall promptly render a decision on the protest. The decision shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for the decision. The decision shall be sent to the protesting party by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The decision of the Director shall be the final decision of the Department of the Interior.


Sec. 1610.5-3  Conformity and implementation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All future resource management authorizations and actions, as well as budget or other action proposals to higher levels in the Bureau of Land Management and Department, and subsequent more detailed or specific planning, shall conform to the approved plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> After a plan is approved or amended, and if otherwise authorized by law, regulation, contract, permit, cooperative agreement or other instrument of occupancy and use, the Field Manager shall take appropriate measures, subject to valid existing rights, to make operations and activities under existing permits, contracts, cooperative agreements or other instruments for occupancy and use, conform to the approved plan or amendment within a reasonable period of time. Any person adversely affected by a specific action being proposed to implement some portion of a resource management plan or amendment may appeal such action pursuant to 43 CFR 4.400 at the time the action is proposed for implementation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a proposed action is not in conformance, and warrants further consideration before a plan revision is scheduled, such consideration shall be through a plan amendment in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1610.5-5 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> More detailed and site specific plans for coal, oil shale and tar sand resources shall be prepared in accordance with specific regulations for those resources: Group 3400 of this title for coal; Group 3900 of this title for oil shale; and part 3140 of this title for tar sand. These activity plans shall be in conformance with land use plans prepared and approved under the provisions of this part.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.5-4  Maintenance.</p><p class="depth0">Resource management plans and supporting components shall be maintained as necessary to reflect minor changes in data. Such maintenance is limited to further refining or documenting a previously approved decision incorporated in the plan. Maintenance shall not result in expansion in the scope of resource uses or restrictions, or change the terms, conditions, and decisions of the approved plan. Maintenance is not considered a plan amendment and shall not require the formal

public involvement and interagency coordination process described under Sec. Sec. 1610.2 and 1610.3 of this title or the preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Maintenance shall be documented in plans and supporting records.


Sec. 1610.5-5  Amendment.</p><p class="depth0">A resource management plan may be changed through amendment. An amendment shall be initiated by the need to consider monitoring and evaluation findings, new data, new or revised policy, a change in circumstances or a proposed action that may result in a change in the scope of resource uses or a change in the terms, conditions and decisions of the approved plan. An amendment shall be made through an environmental assessment of the proposed change, or an environmental impact statement, if necessary, public involvement as prescribed in Sec. 1610.2 of this title, interagency coordination and consistency determination as prescribed in Sec. 1610.3 of this title and any other data or analysis that may be appropriate. In all cases, the effect of the amendment on the plan shall be evaluated. If the amendment is being considered in response to a specific proposal, the analysis required for the proposal and for the amendment may occur simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the environmental assessment does not disclose significant impact, a finding of no significant impact may be made by the Field Manager. The Field Manager shall then make a recommendation on the amendment to the State Director for approval, and upon approval, the Field Manager shall issue a public notice of the action taken on the amendment. If the amendment is approved, it may be implemented 30 days after such notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a decision is made to prepare an environmental impact statement, the amending process shall follow the same procedure required for the preparation and approval of the plan, but consideration shall be limited to that portion of the plan being considered for amendment. If several plans are being amended simultaneously, a single environmental impact statement may be prepared to cover all amendments.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.5-6  Revision.</p><p class="depth0">A resource management plan shall be revised as necessary, based on monitoring and evaluation findings (Sec. 1610.4-9), new data, new or revised policy and changes in circumstances affecting the entire plan or major portions of the plan. Revisions shall comply with all of the requirements of these regulations for preparing and approving an original resource management plan.


Sec. 1610.5-7  Situations where action can be taken based on another agency's plan, or a land use analysis.</p><p class="depth0">These regulations authorize the preparation of a resource management plan for whatever public land interests exist in a given land area. There are situations of mixed ownership where the public land estate is under non-Federal surface, or administration of the land is shared by the Bureau of Land Management with another Federal agency. The Field Manager may use the plans or the land use analysis of other agencies when split or shared estate conditions exist in any of the following situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Another agency's plan (Federal, State, or local) may be used as a basis for an action only if it is comprehensive and has considered the public land interest involved in a way comparable to the manner in which it would have been considered in a resource management plan, including the opportunity for public participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> After evaluation and review, the Bureau of Land Management may adopt another agency's plan for continued use as a resource management plan if an agreement is reached between the Bureau of Land Management and the other agency to provide for maintenance and amendment of the plan, as necessary, to comply with law and policy applicable to public lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A land use analysis may be used to consider a coal lease when there is no Federal ownership interest in the surface or when coal resources are insufficient to justify plan preparation costs. The land use analysis process, as

authorized by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act, consists of an environmental assessment or impact statement, public participation as required by Sec. 1610.2 of this title, the consultation and consistency determinations required by Sec. 1610.3 of this title, the protest procedure prescribed by Sec. 1610.5-2 of this title and a decision on the coal lease proposal. A land use analysis meets the planning requirements of section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The decision to approve the land use analysis and to lease coal is made by the Departmental official who has been delegated the authority to issue coal leases.
