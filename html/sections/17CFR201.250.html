                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After a respondent's answer has been filed and, in an enforcement or a disciplinary proceeding, documents have been made available to that respondent for inspection and copying pursuant to Sec.  201.230, the respondent, or the interested division may make a motion for summary disposition of any or all allegations of the order instituting proceedings with respect to that respondent. If the interested division has not completed presentation of its case in chief, a motion for summary disposition shall be made only with leave of the hearing officer. The facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noted pursuant to Sec.  201.323.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. The hearing officer may grant the motion for summary disposition if there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law. If it appears that a party, for good cause shown, cannot present by affidavit prior to hearing facts essential to justify opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion. A hearing officer's decision to deny leave to file a motion for summary disposition is not subject to interlocutory appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The motion for summary disposition, together with any supporting memorandum of points and authorities (exclusive of any declarations, affidavits, or attachments), shall not exceed 9,800 words. Requests for leave to file motions and accompanying documents in excess of 9,800 words are disfavored. A motion that does not, together with any accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, exceed 35 pages in length, inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference (but excluding any declarations, affidavits, or attachments) is presumptively considered to contain no more than 9,800 words. Any motion that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the length limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words in the motion. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word count of a word-processing program to prepare the document.
