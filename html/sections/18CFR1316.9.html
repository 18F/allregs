                            <p class="depth0">When so indicated in TVA contract documents or actions, the  following clause is included by reference in such documents or actions:</p><p class="depth0">Nuclear Energy Hazards and Nuclear Incidents</p><p class="depth0">(Applicable only to contracts for goods or services delivered to  nuclear plants.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to, or at the time of shipment of the first nuclear fuel  to the TVA nuclear facility, TVA will furnish nuclear liability  protection in accordance with Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act (42  U.S.C. 2210) and applicable regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission. Should this system of protection be repealed or changed, TVA  would undertake to maintain in effect during the period of operation of  the plant, to the extent available on reasonable terms, liability  protection which would not result in a material impairment of the  protection afforded to Contractor and its suppliers under existing  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> TVA waives any claim it might have against Contractor or its  subcontractors because of damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any  property at the site of the TVA nuclear facility resulting from nuclear  energy hazards or nuclear incidents. This provision shall not affect  Contractor's obligation under the ``Warranty'' provision of this  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TVA will indemnify Contractor and its subcontractors and save  them harmless from any claims, losses, or liability arising as a result  of damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property at the site of the  TVA nuclear facility resulting from nuclear energy hazards or nuclear  incidents. In return for this indemnification, Contractor waives any  claim it might have against any third party because of damage to, loss  of, or loss of use of its property at the site of the TVA nuclear  facility resulting from nuclear energy hazards or nuclear incidents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The foregoing waiver and indemnification provisions will apply  to the full extent permitted by law and regardless of fault. The  subcontractors referred to above include any of Contractor's suppliers  of material, equipment, or services for the work, regardless of tier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of these provisions, the following definitions  shall apply: Nuclear energy hazards shall mean the hazardous properties  of nuclear material. Hazardous properties shall include radioactive,  toxic, or explosive properties of nuclear material. Nuclear material  shall include source material, special nuclear material or by-product  material as those are defined in the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014).  Nuclear incident shall have the meaning given that term in the Atomic  Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014(q)).</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
