Materials and equipment purchased by the electric borrowers or accepted as contractor-furnished material must conform to RUS standards and specifications where they have been established and, if included in RUS Bulletin 43-5, ``List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Systems of RUS Electrification Borrowers'' (List of Materials), must be selected from that list or must have received technical acceptance from RUS. RUS, through its Technical Standards Committees, will evaluate certain materials, equipment and construction units, and will determine acceptance.
