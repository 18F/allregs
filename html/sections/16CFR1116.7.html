                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> According to the legislative history of the Consumer Product  Safety Improvement Act of 1990, the purpose of section 37 is to increase  the reporting of information to the Commission that will assist it in  carrying out its responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this part, the lawsuit falls within the scope of section 37  after settlement or adjudication. The manufacturer's opinion as to the  validity of the allegation is irrelevant for reporting purposes. The  category of injury alleged may be clear from the face of an original or  amended complaint in a case or may reasonably be determined during pre- complaint investigation, post-complaint discovery, or informal  settlement negotiation. Conclusory language in a complaint that the  plaintiff suffered grievous bodily injury without further elaboration  raises a presumption that the injury falls within one of the statutory  categories, but is insufficient in itself to bring the suit within the  ambit of the statute, unless the defendant manufacturer elects to settle  such a matter without any investigation of the underlying facts. A case  alleging the occurrence of grievous bodily injury in which a litigated  verdict contains express findings that the injury suffered by the  plaintiff did not meet the statutory criteria is also not reportable.  Should a manufacturer believe that its product is wrongly implicated in  an action, the statute expressly incorporates the mechanism for the  manufacturer to communicate that belief to the Commission by denying in  the report the involvement of the product or that the injury in fact  suffered by the plaintiff was not grievous bodily injury, despite the  plaintiff's allegations to the contrary. In addition, the statute  imposes stringent confidentiality requirements on the disclosure by the  Commission or the Department of Justice of information submitted  pursuant to sections 37(c)(1) and 37(c)(2)(A). Moreover, it specifies  that the reporting of a civil action shall not constitute an admission  of liability under any statute or common law or under the relevant  provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. In view of these  safeguards, the reporting of lawsuits alleging the occurrence of death  or grievous injury should have little adverse effect on manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 37 applies to judgments and ``final settlements''.  Accordingly, the date on which a civil action is filed or the date on  which the product that is the subject of such an action was manufactured  is irrelevant to the obligation to report. A settlement is final upon  the entry by a court of an order disposing of a civil action with  respect to the manufacturer of the product that is the subject of the  action, even through the case may continue with respect to other  defendants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A judgment becomes reportable upon the entry of a final order by  the trial court disposing of the matter in favor of the plaintiff and  from which an appeal lies. Because section 37(c)(2) specifies that a  reporting manufacturer may include a statement that a judgment in favor  of a plaintiff is under appeal or is expected to be appealed, Congress  clearly intended section 37 to apply prior to the exhaustion of or even  the initiation of action to seek appellate remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No language in section 37 limits the reporting obligation to  those litigated cases in which the plaintiff prevails completely.  Therefore, if a court enters a partial judgment in favor of the  plaintiff, the judgment is reportable, unless it is unrelated to the  product that is the subject of the suit. For example, if a  manufacturer's product is exonerated during a suit, but liability is  assessed against another defendant, the manufacturer need not report  under section 37.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 37 applies to civil actions that allege the  involvement of a particular model of a consumer product in death or  grievous bodily injury. Section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act  (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)) defines a ``consumer product'' as any article, or  component part thereof, produced or distributed for sale to a consumer  for   use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a  school, in recreation, or otherwise, or for the personal use,  consumption, or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or  temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise.  The term ``consumer product'' does not include any article which is not  customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption  by, or enjoyment of, a consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Since section 37 focuses on consumer products, it is the  responsibility of the manufacturer of a product implicated in a civil  action to determine whether the production or distribution of the  product satisfies the statutory criteria of section 3(a). If it does,  the action falls within the ambit of section 37. True industrial  products are beyond the scope of section 37. However, if a lawsuit is  based on an allegation of injury involving a consumer product, that suit  falls within the scope of section 37, even though the injury may have  occurred during the use of the product in employment. By the same token,  occupational injuries arising during the fabrication of a consumer  product are not reportable if the entity involved in the injury is not a  consumer product at the time the injury occurs. In determining whether a  product meets the statutory definition, manufacturers may wish to  consult the relevant case law and the advisory opinions issued by the  Commission's Office of the General Counsel. The unique circumstances  surrounding litigation involving asbestos-containing products warrant  one exception to this analysis. The Commission, as a matter of agency  discretion, will require manufacturers of such products to report under  section 37 only those lawsuits that allege the occurrence of death or  grievous bodily injury as the result of exposure to asbestos from a  particular model of a consumer product purchased by a consumer for  personal use. Such lawsuits would include not only injury to the  purchaser, but also to other consumers including family, subsequent  property owners, and visitors. The Commission may consider granting  similar relief to manufacturers of other products that present a risk of  chronic injury similar to that presented by asbestos. Any such request  must contain documented evidence demonstrating that compliance with the  reporting requirements will be unduly burdensome and will be unlikely to  produce information that will assist the Commission in carrying out its  obligations under the statutes it administers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The definition of ``consumer product'' also encompasses a  variety of products that are subject to regulation under the Federal  Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.), the Poison Prevention  Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.), the Flammable Fabrics Act (15  U.S.C. 1191 et seq.), and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211 et  seq.). Lawsuits involving such products are also subject to section 37,  notwithstanding the fact that the products may be regulated or subject  to regulation under one of the other statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Relationship of Section 37 to Section 15 of the CPSA. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Section 37 plays a complementary role to the reporting requirements of  section 15(b) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2064(b)). Section 15(b) establishes  a substantial obligation for firms to review information as it becomes  available to determine whether an obligation to report exists.  Accordingly, the responsibility to report under section 15(b) may arise  long before enough lawsuits involving a product are resolved to create  the obligation to report under section 37. The enactment of section  15(b)(3) in the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990  reinforces this expectation. Under this amendment, manufacturers must  report to the Commission when they obtain information that reasonably  supports the conclusion that a product creates an unreasonable risk of  serious injury or death. Previously, the reporting obligation for  unregulated products only arose when available information indicated  that the product in question was defective and created a substantial  product hazard because of the pattern of the defect, the severity of the  risk of injury, the number of products distributed in commerce, etc. The  effect of the 1990 amendment is discussed in detail in the   Commission's interpretative rule relating to the reporting of  substantial product hazards at 16 CFR part 1115.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The new substantive reporting requirements of section 15(b)(3)  support the conclusion that Congress intended section 37 to capture  product-related accident information that has not been reported under  section 15(b). Between the time a firm learns of an incident or problem  involving a product that raises safety-related concerns and the time  that a lawsuit involving that product is resolved by settlement or  adjudication, the firm generally has numerous opportunities to evaluate  whether a section 15 report is appropriate. Such evaluation might be  appropriate, for example, after an analysis of product returns, the  receipt of an insurance investigator's report, a physical examination of  the product, the interview or deposition of an injured party or an  eyewitness to the event that gave rise to the lawsuit, or even  preparation of the firm's responses to plaintiff's discovery requests.  Even if a manufacturer does not believe that a report is required prior  to the resolution of a single lawsuit, an obligation to investigate  whether a report is appropriate may arise if, for example, a verdict in  favor of the plaintiff raises the issue of whether the product in  question creates an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In contrast, the application of section 37 does not involve the  discretionary judgment and subjective analyses of hazard and causation  associated with section 15 reports. Once the statutory criteria of three  settled or adjudicated civil actions alleging grievous injury or death  in a two year period are met, the obligation to report under section 37  is automatic. For this reason, the Commission regards section 37 as a  ``safety net'' to surface product hazards that remain unreported either  intentionally or by inadvertence. The provisions in the law limiting  such reports to cases in which three or more lawsuits alleging grievous  injury or death are settled or adjudicated in favor of plaintiffs during  a two year period provide assurance that the product involved presents a  sufficiently grave risk of injury to warrant consideration by the  Commission. Indeed, once the obligation to report under section 37  arises, the obligation to file a section 15 report concurrently may  exist if the information available to the manufacturer meets the  criteria established in section 15(b) for reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 37 contains no specific record keeping requirements.  However, to track and catalog lawsuits to determine whether they are  reportable, prudent manufacturers will develop and maintain information  systems to index and retain lawsuit data. In the absence of a prior  section 15 report, once such systems are in place, such manufacturers  will be in a position to perform a two-fold analysis to determine  whether the information contained in such systems is reportable under  either section 15(b) or 37. A manufacturer might conclude, for example,  that the differences between products that are the subject of different  lawsuits make them different models or that the type of injury alleged  in one or more of the suits is not grievous bodily injury. Based on this  analysis, the manufacturer might also conclude that the suits are thus  not reportable under section 37. However, a reporting obligation under  section 15 may exist in any event if the same information reasonably  supports the conclusion that the product(s) contain a defect which could  create a substantial product hazard or create an unreasonable risk of  serious injury or death.</p>
