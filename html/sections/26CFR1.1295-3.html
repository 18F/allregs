                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section prescribes the exclusive rules under which a shareholder, as defined in Sec. 1.1295-1(j), may make a section 1295 election for a taxable year after the election due date, as defined in Sec. 1.1295-1(e) (retroactive election). Therefore, a shareholder may not seek such relief under any other provision of the law, including Sec. 301.9100 of this chapter. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the general rules for a shareholder to preserve the ability to make a retroactive election. These rules require that the shareholder possess reasonable belief as of the election due date that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for its taxable year that ended in the shareholder's taxable year to which the election due date pertains, and that the shareholder file a Protective Statement to preserve its ability to make a retroactive election. Paragraph (c) of

this section establishes the terms, conditions and other requirements with respect to a Protective Statement required to be filed under the general rules. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth factors that establishes a shareholder's reasonable belief that a foreign corporation was not a PFIC. Paragraph (e) of this section prescribes special rules for certain shareholders that are deemed to satisfy the reasonable belief requirement and therefore are not required to file a Protective Statement. Paragraph (f) of this section describes the limited circumstances under which the Commissioner may permit a shareholder that lacked the requisite reasonable belief or failed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) or (e) of this section to make a retroactive election. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the time for and manner of making a retroactive election. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the effective date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule.

A Protective Statement is a statement executed under penalties of perjury by the shareholder, or a person authorized to sign a Federal income tax return on behalf of the shareholder, that preserves the shareholder's ability to make a retroactive election.

The reasonable belief statement is a description of the shareholder's basis for its reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for its taxable year that ended with or within the shareholder's first taxable year to which the Protective Statement applies. If the Protective Statement applies to a taxable year or years described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the reasonable belief statement must describe the shareholder's basis for its reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for the foreign corporation's taxable year or years that ended in such taxable year or years of the shareholder. The

reasonable belief statement must discuss the application of the income and asset tests to the foreign corporation and the factors, including those stated in paragraph (d) of this section, that affect the results of those tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Who executes and files the Protective Statement. The person that executes and files and Protective Statement is the person that makes the section 1295 election, as provided in Sec. 1.1295-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Waiver of the periods of limitations--(i) Time for and manner of extending periods of limitations. (A) In general. A shareholder that files the Protective Statement with the Commissioner must extend the periods of limitations on the assessment of all PFIC related taxes for all of the shareholder's taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies, as provided in this paragraph (c)(4). The shareholder is required to execute the waiver on such form as the Commission may prescribe for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4). Until that form is published, the shareholder must execute a statement in which the shareholder agrees to extend the periods of limitations on the assessment of all PFIC related taxes for all the shareholder's taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies, as provided in this paragraph (c)(4), and agrees to the restrictions in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. The shareholder or a person authorized to sign the shareholder's Federal income tax return must sign the form or statement. A properly executed form or statement authorized by this paragraph (c)(4) will be deemed consented to and signed by a Service Center Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) for purposes of Sec. 301.6501(c)-1(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for and manner of extending periods of limitations.

A domestic partnership that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of paragraph (c)(4) of this section pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(1). The partnership must file one or more waivers obtained or arranged under this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) as part of the Protective Statement, as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The partnership must either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obtain from each partner the partner's waiver of the periods of limitations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain from each partner a duly executed power of attorney under Sec. 601.501 of this chapter authorizing the partnership to extend that partner's periods of limitations, and execute a waiver on behalf of the partners; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a domestic partnership governed by the unified audit and litigation procedures of sections 6221 through 6233 (TEFRA partnership), arrange for the tax matters partner (or any other person authorized to enter into an agreement to extend the periods of limitations), as provided in section 6229(b), to execute a waiver on behalf of all the partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--(i) Addition of partner to non-TEFRA partnership. In the case of any individual who becomes a partner in a domestic partnership other than a TEFRA partnership (non-TEFRA partnership) in a taxable year subsequent to the year in which the partnership filed a Protective Statement, the partner and the partnership must comply with the rules applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section, by the due date, as extended, for the Federal income tax return of the partnership for the taxable year during which the individual became a partner. Failure to so comply will render the Protective Statement invalid with respect to the partnership and partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Addition of partner to non-TEFRA partnership. In the case of any individual who becomes a partner in a domestic partnership other than a TEFRA partnership (non-TEFRA partnership) in a taxable year subsequent to the year in which the partnership filed a Protective Statement, the partner and the partnership must comply with the rules applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section, by the due date, as extended, for the Federal income tax return of the partnership for the taxable year during which the individual became a partner. Failure to so comply will render the Protective Statement invalid with respect to the partnership and partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in status from non-TEFRA partnership to TEFRA partnership. If a partnership is a non-TEFRA partnership in one taxable year but becomes a TEFRA partnership in a subsequent taxable year, the partnership must file one or more waivers obtained or arranged under this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii), as part of the Protective Statement, as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The partnership must either--obtain from any new partner the partner's waiver described in this paragraph (c)(4); obtain from the new partner a duly executed power of attorney under Sec. 601.501 of this chapter authorizing the partnership to extend the partner's periods of limitations, and execute a waiver on behalf of the new partner; or arrange for the tax

matters partner (or any other person authorized to enter into an agreement to extend the periods of limitations) to execute a waiver on behalf of all the partners. In each case, the partnership must attach any new waiver of a partner's periods of limitations, and a copy of the Protective Statement to its Federal income tax return for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Application of general rule to domestic nongrantor trusts and domestic estates. A domestic nongrantor trust or a domestic estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the entity level. For this purpose, such entity must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Application of general rule to S corporations. An S corporation that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the S corporation level. For this purpose, the S corporation must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this section. However, in the case of an S corporation that was governed by the unified audit corporate proceedings of sections 6241 through 6245 for any taxable year to which a Protective Statement applies (former TEFRA S corporation), the tax matters person (or any other person authorized to enter into such an agreement), as was provided in sections 6241 through 6245, may execute a waiver described in this paragraph (c)(4) that applies to such taxable year; for any other taxable year, the former TEFRA S corporation must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Effect on waiver of complete termination of a pass through entity or pass through entity's business. The complete termination of a pass through entity described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section, or a pass through entity's trade or business, will not terminate a waiver that applies to a partner, shareholder, or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Application of general rule to foreign partnerships, foreign trusts, domestic or foreign grantor trusts, and foreign estates. A U.S. person that is a partner or beneficiary of a foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the partner or beneficiary level. A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as the owner of the portion of a domestic or foreign trust that owns an interest in PFIC stock also satisfies the waiver requirement at the owner level. A waiver by a partner or beneficiary applies only to that partner or beneficiary, and is not affected by a complete termination of the entity or the entity's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Terms of waiver--(A) Scope of waiver. The waiver of the periods of limitations is limited to the assessment of PFIC related taxes. If the period of limitations for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election has expired with respect to the assessment of other non-PFIC related taxes, no adjustments, other than consequential changes, may be made by the Internal Revenue Service or by the shareholder to any other item of income, deduction, or credit for that year. If the period of limitations for refunds or credits for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election is open only by virtue of the assessment period extension and section 6511(c), no refund or credit is allowable on grounds other than adjustments to PFIC related taxes and consequential changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Scope of waiver. The waiver of the periods of limitations is limited to the assessment of PFIC related taxes. If the period of limitations for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election has expired with respect to the assessment of other non-PFIC related taxes, no adjustments, other than consequential changes, may be made by the Internal Revenue Service or by the shareholder to any other item of income, deduction, or credit for that year. If the period of limitations for refunds or credits for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election is open only by virtue of the assessment period extension and section 6511(c), no refund or credit is allowable on grounds other than adjustments to PFIC related taxes and consequential changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Period of Waiver. The extension of the periods of limitations on the assessment of PFIC related taxes will be effective for all of the shareholder's taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies. In addition, the waiver, to the extent it applies to the period of limitations for a particular year, will terminate with respect to that year no sooner than three years from the date on which the shareholder files an amended return, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, for that year. For the suspension of the running of the period of limitations for the collection of taxes for which a shareholder has elected under section 1294 to extend the time for payment, as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, see sections 6503(i) and 6229(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Time of and manner for filing a Protective Statement--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, a Protective Statement must be attached to the shareholder's federal income tax return for the shareholder's first taxable year to which the Protective Statement will apply. The shareholder must file its return and the copy of the Protective Statement by the due date, as extended under section 6081, for the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, a Protective Statement must be attached to the shareholder's federal income tax return for the shareholder's first taxable year to which the Protective Statement will apply. The shareholder must file its return and the copy of the Protective Statement by the due date, as extended under section 6081, for the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for taxable years ended before January 2, 1998. A shareholder may file a Protective Statement that applies to the shareholder's taxable year or years that ended before January 2, 1998, provided the period of limitations on the assessment of taxes for any such year has not expired (open year). The shareholder must file the Protective Statement applicable to such open year or years, as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, by the due date, as extended, for the shareholder's return for the first taxable year ending after January 2, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Applicability of the Protective Statement--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6), a Protective Statement applies to the shareholder's first taxable year for which the Protective Statement was filed and to each subsequent taxable year. The Protective Statement will not apply to any taxable year of the shareholder during which the shareholder does not own any stock of the foreign corporation or to any taxable year thereafter. Accordingly, if the shareholder has not made a retroactive election with respect to the previously owned stock by the time the shareholder reacquires stock of the foreign corporation, the shareholder must file another Protective Statement to preserve its right to make a retroactive election with respect to the later acquired stock. For the rule that provides that a section 1295 election made with respect to a foreign corporation applies to stock of that corporation acquired after a lapse in ownership, see Sec. 1.1295-1(c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6), a Protective Statement applies to the shareholder's first taxable year for which the Protective Statement was filed and to each subsequent taxable year. The Protective Statement will not apply to any taxable year of the shareholder during which the shareholder does not own any stock of the foreign corporation or to any taxable year thereafter.

A shareholder will be treated as if it never filed a Protective Statement if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The shareholder failed to make a retroactive election by the date prescribed for making the retroactive election in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The waiver of the periods of limitations terminates (by reason of a court decision or other determination) with respect to any taxable year before the expiration of three years from the date of filing of an amended return for that year pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Retention of Protective Statement and information demonstrating reasonable belief. A shareholder that files a Protective Statement must retain a copy of the Protective Statement and its attachments and must, for each taxable year of the shareholder to which the Protective Statement applies, retain information sufficient to demonstrate the shareholder's reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending during each such taxable year of the shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reasonable belief--(1) In general. A foreign corporation is a PFIC for a taxable year if the foreign corporation satisfies either the income or asset test of section 1297(a). To determine whether a shareholder had reasonable belief that the foreign corporation is not a PFIC under section 1297(a), the shareholder must consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Reasonable belief may be based on a variety of factors, including reasonable asset valuations as well as reasonable interpretations of the applicable provisions of the Code, regulations, and administrative guidance regarding the direct and indirect ownership of the income or assets of the foreign corporation, the proper character of that income or those assets, and similar issues. Reasonable belief may be based on reasonable predictions regarding income to be earned and assets to be owned in subsequent years where qualifications of the foreign corporation as a PFIC for the current taxable year will depend on the qualification of the corporation as a PFIC in a subsequent year. Reasonable belief may be based on an analysis of generally available financial information of the foreign corporation. To determine whether a shareholder had reasonable belief

that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC, the Commissioner may consider the size of the shareholder's interest in the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Reasonable belief must be based on a good faith effort to apply the Code, regulations, and related administrative guidance. Any person's failure to know or apply these provisions will not form the basis of reasonable belief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for qualified shareholders--(1) In general. A shareholder that is a qualified shareholder, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for a taxable year of the shareholder is not required to satisfy the reasonable belief requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or file a Protective Statement to preserve its ability to make a retroactive election with respect to such taxable year. Accordingly, a qualified shareholder may make a retroactive election for any open taxable year in the shareholder's holding period. The retroactive election will be treated as made in the earliest taxable year of the shareholder during which the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC (including a taxable year ending prior to January 2, 1998) and the shareholder will be treated as a shareholder of a pedigreed QEF, as defined in Sec. 1.1291-9(j)(2)(ii), provided the shareholder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a shareholder will not be treated as a qualified shareholder for a taxable year of the shareholder if the shareholder knew or had reason to know that a corporate filing regarding the foreign corporation's PFIC status was inaccurate, or knew that the foreign corporation was a PFIC for the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within such taxable year of the shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph, a shareholder will be treated as knowing that a foreign corporation was a PFIC if the principal activity of the foreign corporation, directly or indirectly, is owning or trading a diversified portfolio of stock, securities, or other financial contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special consent--(1) In general.

Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a shareholder is deemed to have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional only if the shareholder reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional (including a tax professional employed by the shareholder) who failed to identify the foreign corporation as a PFIC or failed to advise the shareholder of the consequences of making, or failing to make, the section 1295 election.

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a shareholder is deemed to have not reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the shareholder was informed by the qualified tax professional that the foreign corporation was a PFIC and of the availability of the section 1295 election and related tax consequences, but either chose not to make the section 1295 election or was unable to make a valid section 1295 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prejudice to the interests of the United States government--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commissioner will not grant consent under paragraph (f) of this section if doing so would prejudice the interests of the United States government. The interests of the United States government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the shareholder having a lower tax liability, taking into account applicable interest charges, in the aggregate for all years affected by the retroactive election (other than by a de minimis amount) than the shareholder would have had if the shareholder had made the section 1295 election by the election due date. The time value of money is taken into account for purposes of this computation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elimination of prejudice to the interests of the United States government. Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, if granting relief would prejudice the interests of the United States government, the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's sole discretion, grant consent to make the election provided the shareholder enters into a closing agreement with the Commissioner that requires the shareholder to pay an amount sufficient to eliminate any prejudice to the United States government as a consequence of the shareholder's inability to file amended returns for closed taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedural requirements--(i) Filing instructions. A shareholder requests consent under paragraph (f) of this section to make a retroactive election by filing with the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) a ruling request that includes the affidavits required by this paragraph (f)(4). The ruling request must satisfy the requirements, including payment of the user fee, for ruling requests filed with that office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing instructions. A shareholder requests consent under paragraph (f) of this section to make a retroactive election by filing with the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) a ruling request that includes the affidavits required by this paragraph (f)(4). The ruling request must satisfy the requirements, including payment of the user fee, for ruling requests filed with that office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Affidavit from shareholder. The shareholder, or a person authorized to

sign a Federal income tax return on behalf of the shareholder, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to make a section 1295 election by the election due date, and to the discovery thereof. The shareholder's affidavit must describe the engagement and responsibilities of the qualified tax professional as well as the extent to which the shareholder relied on the tax professional. The shareholder must sign the affidavit under penalties of perjury. An individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances at issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Affidavits from other persons. The shareholder must submit detailed affidavits from individuals having knowledge or information about the events that led to the failure to make a section 1295 election by the election due date, and to the discovery thereof. These individuals must include the qualified tax professional upon whose advice the shareholder relied, as well as any individual (including an employee of the shareholder) who made a substantial contribution to the return's preparation, and any accountant or attorney, knowledgeable in tax matters, who advised the shareholder with regard to its ownership of the stock of the foreign corporation. Each affidavit must describe the individual's engagement and responsibilities as well as the advice concerning the tax treatment of the foreign corporation that that individual provided to the shareholder. Each affidavit also must include the individual's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, and must be signed by the individual under penalties of perjury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other information. In connection with a request for consent under this paragraph (f), a shareholder must provide any additional information requested by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notification of Internal Revenue Service. The shareholder must notify the branch of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) considering the request for relief under this paragraph (f) if, while the shareholder's request for consent is pending, the Internal Revenue Service begins an examination of the shareholder's return for the retroactive election year or for any subsequent taxable year during which the shareholder holds stock of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Who requests special consent under this paragraph (f) and who enters into a closing agreement. The person that requests consent under this paragraph (f) is the person that makes the section 1295 election, as provided in Sec. 1.1295-1(d). If a shareholder is required to enter into a closing agreement with the Commissioner, as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, rules similar to those under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (E) of this section apply for purposes of determining the person that enters into the closing agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Time for and manner of making a retroactive election--(1) Time for making a retroactive election--(i) In general.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, a shareholder must make a retroactive election, in the manner provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, on or before the due date, as extended, for the shareholder's return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a shareholder that makes a retroactive election pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, for the taxable year in which the shareholder determines or reasonably should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a shareholder that obtains the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section for the taxable year in which such consent is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transition rule. A shareholder that files a Protective Statement for a taxable year described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section may make a retroactive election by the due date, as extended, for the return for the first taxable year ended after January 2, 1998 even if the shareholder determined or should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC for a year described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section at any time on or before January 2, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ownership not required at time retroactive election is made. The shareholder need not own shares of the foreign corporation at the time the shareholder makes a retroactive election with respect to the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner of making a retroactive election. A shareholder that has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, or a shareholder that has been granted consent under paragraph (f) of this section, must make a retroactive election in the manner provided in Form 8621 for making a section 1295 election, and must attach Form 8621 to an amended return for the later of the retroactive election year or the earliest open taxable year of the shareholder. The shareholder also must file an amended return for each of its subsequent taxable years affected by the retroactive election. In each amended return the shareholder must redetermine its income tax liability for that year to take into account the assessment of PFIC related taxes. If the period of limitations for the assessment of taxes for a taxable year affected by the retroactive election has expired except to the extent the waiver of limitations, described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, has extended such period, no adjustments, other than consequential changes, may be made to any other items of income, deduction, or credit in that year. In addition, the shareholder must pay all taxes and interest owing by reason of the PFIC and QEF status of the foreign corporation in those years (except to the extent a section 1294 election extends the time to pay the taxes and interest). A shareholder that filed a Protective Statement must attach to Form 8621 filed with each amended return a representation that the shareholder, until the taxable year in which it determined or reasonably should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC, reasonably believed, within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section, that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC in the taxable year for which the amended return is filed, and in all other taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies. A shareholder that entered into a closing agreement must comply with the terms of that agreement, as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, to eliminate any prejudice to the United States government's interests, as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Who makes the retroactive election. The person that makes the retroactive election is the person that makes the section 1295 election, as provided in Sec. 1.1295-1(d). A partner, shareholder, or beneficiary for which a pass through entity, as described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section, filed a Protective Statement may make a retroactive election, if the pass through entity completely terminates its business or otherwise ceases to exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other elections--(i) Section 1291(d)(2) election. If the foreign corporation for which the shareholder makes a retroactive election will be treated as an unpedigreed QEF, as defined in Sec. 1.1291-9(j)(2)(iii), with respect to the shareholder, the shareholder may make an election under section 1291(d)(2) to purge its holding period of the years or parts of years before the effective date of the retroactive election. If the qualification date, within the meaning of Sec. 1.1291-9(e) or 1.1291-10(e), falls in a taxable year for which the period of limitations has expired, the shareholder may treat the first day of the retroactive election year as the qualification date. The shareholder may make a section 1291(d)(2) election at the time that it makes the retroactive election, but no later than two years after the date that the amended return in which the retroactive election is made is filed. For the requirements for making a section 1291(d)(2) election, see Sec. Sec. 1.1291-9 and 1.1291-10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 1291(d)(2) election. If the foreign corporation for which the shareholder makes a retroactive election will be treated as an unpedigreed QEF, as defined in Sec. 1.1291-9(j)(2)(iii), with respect to the shareholder, the shareholder may make an election under section 1291(d)(2) to purge its holding period of the years or parts of years before the effective date of the retroactive election. If the qualification date, within the meaning of Sec. 1.1291-9(e) or 1.1291-10(e), falls in a taxable year for which the period of limitations has expired, the shareholder may treat the first day of the retroactive election year as the qualification date.

A shareholder may make an election under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of tax on the shareholder's pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the foreign corporation reported in the shareholder's amended return, and section 6621 interest attributable to such tax, but only to the extent the tax and interest are attributable to earnings that have not been distributed to the shareholder. The shareholder must make a section 1294 election for a taxable year at the time that it files its amended return for that year, as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. For the requirements for making a section 1294 election, see Sec. 1.1294-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date. The rules of this section are effective as of January 2, 1998.
