                                Sec. 762.150  Interest assistance program.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for interest assistance. In addition to the loan  application items required by Sec. 762.110, to apply for interest  assistance the lender's cash flow budget for the guaranteed applicant  must reflect the need for interest assistance and the ability to cash  flow with the subsidy. Interest assistance is available only on new  guaranteed Operating Loans (OL).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility requirements. The lender must document that the  following conditions have been met for the applicant to be eligible for  interest assistance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A feasible plan cannot be achieved without interest assistance,  but can be achieved with interest assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If significant changes in the borrower's cash flow budget are  anticipated after the initial 12 months, then the typical cash flow  budget must demonstrate that the borrower will still have a feasible  plan following the anticipated changes, with or without interest  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The typical cash flow budget must demonstrate that the borrower  will have a feasible plan throughout the term of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The borrower, including members of an entity borrower, does not  own any significant assets that do not contribute directly to essential  family living or farm operations. The lender must determine the market  value of any such non-essential assets and prepare a cash flow budget  and interest assistance calculations based on the assumption that these  assets will be sold and the market value proceeds used for debt  reduction. If a feasible plan can then be achieved, the borrower is not  eligible for interest assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A borrower may only receive interest assistance if their total  debts (including personal debts) prior to the new loan exceed 50 percent  of their total assets (including personal assets). An entity's debt to  asset ratio will be based upon a financial statement that consolidates  business and personal debts and assets of the entity and its members.  Beginning farmers Sec. 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in Sec.  762.102, are excluded from this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maximum assistance. The maximum total guaranteed OL debt on  which a borrower can receive interest assistance is $400,000, regardless  of the number of guaranteed loans outstanding. This is a lifetime limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maximum time for which interest assistance is available. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  borrower may only receive interest assistance for one 5-year period. The  term of the interest assistance agreement executed under this section  shall not exceed 5 consecutive years from the date of the initial  agreement signed by the applicant, including any entity members, or the  outstanding term of the loan, whichever is less. This is a lifetime  limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning farmers Sec. 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in  Sec. 762.102, however, may be considered for two 5-year periods. The  applicant must meet the definition of a beginning farmer and meet the  other eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph (b) of this section  at the onset of each 5-year period. A needs test will be completed in  the fifth year of IA eligibility for beginning farmers, to determine  continued eligibility for a second 5-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the limitation of paragraph (d)(1) of this  section, a new interest assistance agreement may be approved for  eligible borrowers to provide interest assistance through June 8, 2009,  provided the total period does not exceed 10 years from the effective  date of the original interest assistance agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple loans. In the case of a borrower with multiple  guaranteed loans with one lender, interest assistance can be applied to  each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender selects, as  necessary to achieve a feasible plan, subject to paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Terms. The typical term of scheduled loan repayment will not be  reduced solely for the purpose of maximizing eligibility for interest  assistance. A loan must be scheduled over the maximum term typically  used by lenders for similar type loans within the limits in Sec.  762.124. An OL for the purpose of providing annual operating and family  living expenses will be scheduled for repayment when the income is  scheduled to be received from the sale of the crops, livestock, and/or  livestock products which will serve as security for the loan. An OL for  purposes other than annual operating and family living expenses (i.e.  purchase of equipment or livestock, or refinancing existing debt) will  be scheduled over 7 years from the effective date of the proposed  interest assistance agreement, or the life of the security, whichever is  less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rate of interest. The lender interest rate will be set according  to Sec. 762.124(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Agreement. The lender and borrower must execute an interest  assistance agreement as prescribed by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Interest assistance claims and payments. To receive an interest  assistance payment, the lender must prepare and submit a claim on the  appropriate Agency form. The following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest assistance payments will be four (4) percent of the  average daily principal loan balance prorated over the number of days  the loan has been outstanding during the payment period. For loans with  a note rate less than four (4) percent, interest assistance payments  will be the weighted average interest rate multiplied by the average  daily principal balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender may select at the time of loan closing the date that  they wish to receive an interest assistance payment. That date will be  included in the interest assistance agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The initial and final claims submitted under an agreement may be  for a period less than 12 months. All other claims will be submitted for  a 12-month period, unless there is a lender substitution during the 12- month period in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event of liquidation, the final interest assistance  claim will be submitted with the estimated loss claim or the final loss  claim if an estimated loss claim was not submitted. Interest will not be  paid beyond the interest accrual cutoff dates established in the loss  claims according to Sec. 762.149(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A claim should be filed within 60 days of its due date. Claims  not filed within 1 year from the due date will not be paid, and the  amount due the lender will be permanently forfeited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All claims will be supported by detailed calculations of average  daily principal balance during the claim period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requests for continuation of interest assistance for agreements  dated   prior to June 8, 2007 will be supported by the lender's analysis of the  applicant's farming operation and need for continued interest assistance  as set out in their Interest Assistance Agreements. The following  information will be submitted to the Agency:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A summary of the operation's actual financial performance in the  previous year, including a detailed income and expense statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative description of the causes of any major differences  between the previous year's projections and actual performance,  including a detailed income and expense statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A current balance sheet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A cash-flow budget for the period being planned. A monthly  cash-flow budget is required for all lines of credit and operating loans  made for annual operating purposes. All other loans may include either  an annual or monthly cash-flow budget.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A copy of the interest assistance needs analysis portion of the  application form which has been completed based on the planned period's  cash-flow budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interest Assistance Agreements dated June 8, 2007 or later do  not require a request for continuation of interest assistance. The  lender will only be required to submit an Agency IA payment form and the  average daily principal balance for the claim period, with supporting  documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lenders may not charge or cause a borrower with an interest  assistance agreement to be charged a fee for preparation and submission  of the items required for an annual interest assistance claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Transfer, consolidation, and writedown. Loans covered by  interest assistance agreements cannot be consolidated. Such loans can be  transferred only when the transferee was liable for the debt on the  effective date of the interest assistance agreement. Loans covered by  interest assistance can be transferred to an entity if the entity is  eligible in accordance with Sec. Sec. 762.120 and 762.150(b) and at  least one entity member was liable for the debt on the effective date of  the interest assistance agreement. Interest assistance will be  discontinued as of the date of any writedown on a loan covered by an  interest assistance agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Rescheduling and deferral. When a borrower defaults on a loan  with interest assistance or the loan otherwise requires rescheduling or  deferral, the interest assistance agreement will remain in effect for  that loan at its existing terms. The lender may reschedule the loan in  accordance with Sec. 762.145. For Interest Assistance Agreements dated  June 8, 2007 or later increases in the restructured loan amount above  the amount originally obligated do not require additional funding;  however, interest assistance is not available on that portion of the  loan as interest assistance is limited to the original loan amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Bankruptcy. In cases where the interest on a loan covered by an  interest assistance agreement is reduced by court order in a  reorganization plan under the bankruptcy code, interest assistance will  be terminated effective on the date of the court order. Guaranteed loans  which have had their interest reduced by bankruptcy court order are not  eligible for interest assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Termination of interest assistance payments. Interest assistance  payments will cease upon termination of the loan guarantee, upon  reaching the expiration date contained in the agreement, or upon  cancellation by the Agency under the terms of the interest assistance  agreement. In addition, for loan guarantees sold into the secondary  market, Agency purchase of the guaranteed portion of a loan will  terminate the interest assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Excessive interest assistance. Upon written notice to the  lender, borrower, and any holder, the Agency may amend or cancel the  interest assistance agreement and collect from the lender any amount of  interest assistance granted which resulted from incomplete or inaccurate  information, an error in computation, or any other reason which resulted  in payment that the lender was not entitled to receive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Condition for cancellation. The Interest Assistance Agreement is  incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation, of which the lender  or borrower have actual knowledge at the time the interest assistance  agreement   is executed, or which the lender or borrower participates in or  condones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Substitution. If there is a substitution of lender, the original  lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a claim for its final  interest assistance payment calculated through the effective date of the  substitution. This final claim will be submitted for processing at the  time of the substitution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest assistance will continue automatically with the new  lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The new lender must follow paragraph (i) of this section to  receive their initial and subsequent interest assistance payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Exception Authority. The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan  Programs has the authority to grant an exception to any requirement  involving interest assistance if it is in the best interest of the  Government and is not inconsistent with other applicable law.  [72 FR 17358, Apr. 9, 2007, as amended at 78 FR 14005, Mar. 4, 2013; 78  FR 65530, Nov. 1, 2013]    Sec. Sec. 762.151-762.158  [Reserved]</p>
