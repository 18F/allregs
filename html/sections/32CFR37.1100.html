                            <p class="depth0">As the administrative agreements officer for a TIA, you have the responsibilities that your office agreed to accept in the delegation from the office that made the award. Generally, you will have the same responsibilities as a post-award administrator of a grant or cooperative agreement, as described in 32 CFR 22.715. Responsibilities for TIAs include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Advising agreements officers before they award TIAs on how to establish award terms and conditions that better meet research programmatic needs, facilitate effective post-award administration, and ensure good stewardship of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participating as the business partner to the DoD program official to ensure the Government's substantial involvement in the research project. This may involve attendance with program officials at kickoff meetings or post-award conferences with recipients.

It also may involve attendance at the consortium management's periodic meetings to review technical progress, financial status, and future program plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tracking and processing of reports required by the award terms and conditions, including periodic business status reports, programmatic progress reports, and patent reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Handling payment requests and related matters. For a TIA using advance payments, that includes reviews of progress to verify that there is continued justification for advancing funds, as discussed in Sec. 37.1105(b). For a TIA using milestone payments, it includes making any needed adjustments in future milestone payment amounts, as discussed in Sec. 37.1105(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coordinating audit requests and reviewing audit reports for both single audits of participants' systems and any award-specific audits that may be needed, as discussed in Secs. 37.1115 and 37.1120.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Responding, after coordination with program officials, to recipient requests for permission to sell or exclusively license intellectual property to entities that do not agree to manufacture substantially in the United States, as described in Sec. 37.875(b). Before you grant approval for any technology, you must secure assurance that the Government will be able to use the technology (e.g., a reasonable license for Government use, if the recipient is selling the technology) or seek reimbursement of the Government's investments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notifying the agreements officer who made the award if a participant informs you about a subaward allowing a for-profit subrecipient to have audits performed by an IPA, rather than the DCAA. You should alert the awarding official that he or she must report the information, as required by Sec. 37.1030(c).</p>
