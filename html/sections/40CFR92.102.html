                            <p class="depth0">The definitions and abbreviations of subpart A of this part apply to  this subpart. The following definitions and abbreviations, as well as  those found in Sec. 92.132 (Calculations), also apply:</p><p class="depth0">Accuracy means the difference between the measured value and the  true value, where the true value is determined from NIST traceable  measurements where possible, or otherwise determined by good engineering  practice.</p><p class="depth0">Calibration means the act of calibrating an analytical instrument  using known standards.</p><p class="depth0">Calibration gas means a gas of known concentration which is used to  establish the response curve of an analyzer.</p><p class="depth0">Good engineering practice means those methods and practices which  the Administrator determines to be consistent with scientific and  engineering principles.</p><p class="depth0">Hang-up refers to the process of hydrocarbon molecules being  adsorbed, condensed, or by any other method removed from the sample flow  prior to reaching the instrument detector. It also refers to any  subsequent desorption of the molecules into the sample flow when they  are assumed to be absent.</p><p class="depth0">Parts per million, carbon or ppmC means the concentration of an  organic compound in a gas expressed as parts per million (by volume or  by moles) multiplied by the number of carbon atoms in a molecule of that  compound.</p><p class="depth0">Precision means the standard deviation of replicated measurements,  or one-half of the readability, whichever is greater; except where  explicitly noted otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">Readability means the smallest difference in measured values that  can be detected. For example, the readability for a digital display with  two decimal places would be 0.01.</p><p class="depth0">Span gas means a gas of known concentration which is used routinely  to set the output level of an analyzer.</p><p class="depth0">Standard conditions and standard temperature and pressure mean 68 F  (20 C) and 29.92 in Hg. (101.3 kPa).</p>
