Approved  courses are those that are part of an identified course of study leading  to a postsecondary certificate or degree and non-degree oriented  language courses integral to the Defense Language Transformation Roadmap  (available at http://www.defense.gov/news/Mar2005/d20050330roadmap.pdf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of TA for non-degree oriented language courses is limited to  those published by the Under Secretary of Defense (P&R;) on the DoD  Strategic Language List.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dominant-in-the-force languages and languages deemed by DoD as  already having sufficient strategic capacity will not be funded under 10  U.S.C. 2007, except for assignments outside the continental United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> TA will be applied as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For 100 percent of the cost of approved high school completion  programs for Service members who have not been awarded a high school or  equivalency diploma and who are enrolled in such programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (F)  of this section, of the charges of an educational institution for  education during the member's off-duty periods. TA funding will only be  paid to educational institutions accredited by an accrediting  organization recognized by ED, approved VA funding, and certified to  participate in federal student aid programs through the ED under Title  IV of Public Law 89-329, also known and referred to in this part as the  Higher Education Act of 1965. Whenever ED withdraws the recognition of  any accrediting agency, an institution of higher education that meets  the requirements of accreditation, eligibility, and certification on the  day before such withdrawal, may, notwithstanding the withdrawal,  continue to participate in the TA program for a period not to exceed 18  months from the date of the withdrawal of recognition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> When an educational institution's charges are equal to or less  than the established cap per semester-hour of credit or its equivalent,  the responsible Service will pay the entire amount charged by the  educational institution. In computing credit equivalency, the following  conversions will apply: 1 quarter-hour credit = 2/3 semester-hour  credit; and 45 contact hours will be considered equivalent to 1  semester-hour credit when neither semester- nor quarter-hours are  specified for the education for which the Service member is enrolled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When an educational institution's charges exceed the established  cap per semester-hour of credit, or its equivalent, the responsible  Service, will pay no more than the established cap per semester-unit (or  equivalent) for tuition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each Service member participating in off-duty, voluntary  education will be allowed no more than the established annual ceiling,  in aggregate, for each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Covered charges include those that are submitted to the Service  by the educational institution for tuition only. Educational  institutions that   bundle tuition, fees, or books into a consolidated cost must detail the  charges of fees and books separately for Service members participating  in the TA program. Fees include any charge not directly related to  course instruction including but not limited to costs associated with  room, board, distance learning, equipment, supplies, books/materials,  exams, insurance, parking, transportation, admissions, registration, or  fines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> TA funds are not to be used for the purchase of books to include  textbooks, ebooks, CDs/DVDs, or reference or instructional materials.  Additionally, institutional education revenue generated from military TA  funds cannot be used to support textbook grants or scholarships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> To be eligible to receive TA, a Service member must meet the  minimum requirement of successfully completing basic training. RC  members are exempt from the requirement to first attend basic training  before authorized to receive TA. Additional, respective Service  requirements must be met to include training qualification, unit  assignment, and time in service criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The TA rate, credit-cap, and annual per capita ceiling, will  be reviewed annually in consideration of inflation and other effects,  and will be applicable uniformly whether instruction is delivered  traditionally in-the-classroom or through distance education. Rates of  TA other than as identified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) of  this section are not authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service-specific TA eligibility requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Service- specific eligibility criteria and management controls are determined by  each Military Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Service-specific TA eligibility criteria and management  controls may include, but are not limited to, applying TA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For courses leading to a certificate or required for a  credentialing program. All payments for courses must comply with the  allowable caps and ceilings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For graduate studies through the master's degree level. All  payments for courses must comply with the allowable caps and ceilings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For same level degrees, subject to the availability of funds.  However, TA is primarily intended to raise the academic degree level of  the Service member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> TA is available to a commissioned officer on active duty, other  than an officer serving in the Ready Reserves (addressed in paragraphs  (a)(5)(i) and (a)(6)(i) of this section), only if the officer agrees to  remain on active duty, for a period of at least 2 years after the  completion of the education or training for which TA was paid (see 10  U.S.C. 2007).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Secretary of the Military Department concerned may only make  TA available to a member of the SELRES, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2007,  under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a commissioned officer, the officer must agree to  remain a member of the SELRES for at least 4 years after completion of  the education or training for which TA is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an enlisted member, the Secretary concerned may  require the member of the SELRES to enter into an agreement to remain a  member of the SELRES for up to 4 years after completion of the education  or training for which TA is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Secretary of the Military Department concerned may only make  TA available to a member of the IRR who has a military occupational  specialty designated by the Secretary concerned pursuant to 10 U.S.C.  2007 and only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a commissioned officer, the officer must agree to  remain a member of the SELRES or IRR for at least 4 years after  completion of the education or training for which TA was paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an enlisted member, the Secretary concerned may  require the member of the IRR to enter into an agreement to remain a  member of the IRR for up to 4 years after completion of the education or  training for which TA is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Members performing Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) duty under  either 10 U.S.C. 12310 or active duty under 14 U.S.C. 712 are eligible  for TA under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The Secretary of the Military Department concerned may make TA   available to National Guard members in accordance with paragraph (a)(4),  except for National Guard members assigned to the Inactive National  Guard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Reimbursement and repayment requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a commissioned officer or member of the RR does not fulfill a  specified Service obligation as required by 10 U.S.C. 2007, they are  subject to the repayment provisions of 37 U.S.C. 303a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For other conditions pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2005, the Secretary  concerned may require a Service member to enter into a written agreement  when providing advanced education assistance. If the Service member does  not fulfill any terms or conditions as prescribed by the Secretary  concerned, the Service member will be subject to the repayment  provisions of 37 U.S.C. 303a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 303a(e), the Secretary concerned may  establish procedures for determining the amount of the repayment  required from the Service member and the circumstances under which an  exception to the required repayment may be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reimbursement will be required from the Service member if a  successful course completion is not obtained. For the purpose of  reimbursement, a successful course completion is defined as a grade of  ``C'' or higher for undergraduate courses, a ``B'' or higher for  graduate courses and a ``Pass'' for ``Pass/Fail'' grades. Reimbursement  will also be required from the Service member if he or she fails to make  up a grade of ``I'' for incomplete within the time limits stipulated by  the educational institution or 6 months after the completion of the  class, whichever comes first. The Secretary of the Military Department  will establish recoupment processes for unsuccessful completion of  courses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Students using TA must maintain a cumulative grade point  average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher after completing 15 semester hours, or  equivalent, in undergraduate studies, or a GPA of 3.0 or higher after  completing 6 semester hours, or equivalent, in graduate studies, on a  4.0 grading scale. If the GPA for TA funded courses falls below these  minimum GPA limits, TA will not be authorized and Service members will  use alternative funding (such as financial aid or personal funds) to  enroll in courses to raise the cumulative GPA to 2.0 for undergraduate  studies or 3.0 for graduate studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> TA will not be authorized for any course for which a Service  member receives reimbursement in whole or in part from any other Federal  source such as veterans' education benefits (GI Bill and other programs)  and Service-funded programs (ROTC scholarship, education-related  incentive or bonus, and advanced civil schooling) when the payment would  constitute a duplication of benefits paid to that educational  institution. Federal student aid loan, grant, and work-study programs  will not be considered a duplication of benefit. Educational  institutions have the responsibility to notify the Service if there is  any duplication of benefits, determine the amount of credit that should  be returned, and credit the amount back to the Service. The use of funds  related to veterans' education benefits to supplement TA received by  active duty and RC personnel is authorized in accordance with applicable  VA guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Pell Grants may be used in conjunction with TA assistance to  pay that portion of tuition costs not covered by TA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> TA will be provided for courses provided by educational  institutions awarding degrees based on demonstrated competency, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Competency rates are equated to semester or quarter units of  credit, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The educational institution publishes traditional grade  correlations with ``Pass/Fail'' grades, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The educational institution provides a breakdown by course  equivalent for Service members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Enrollment in a professional practicum integral to these types  of programs is also authorized. However, normal DoD TA caps and ceilings  apply; the cost of expanded levels of enrollment over and above these  enrollment levels and normal caps and ceilings must be borne by the  student.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> When used for postsecondary education, TA will be provided only  for courses offered by postsecondary educational institutions whose home  campus is operating within the United   States, to include the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, which  are accredited by a national or regional accrediting body recognized by  the ED.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> On a date to be determined, but not earlier than 60 days  following the publication of this part in the Federal Register, to  receive TA, all educational institution home campuses must sign the  revised DoD Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) in appendices A, B, C, D, and E to this part, and the name of the  educational institution must be posted on the DoD MOU Web site under the  `Participating Institutions' tab (located at http://www.dodmou.com). One  signed, revised DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU with the  educational institution's home campus will cover any program offered by  the educational institution, regardless of location. The requirement to  sign the revised DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU contained in  this part applies to institutions with a previously approved and signed  DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU posted on the DoD MOU Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> To the extent that any provision of the standard language of  the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU template in appendices A, B,  C, D, and E to this part, results from DoD policy that conflicts with a  state law or regulation, the DASD(MCFP) may authorize amending the  standard language of the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU  template on a case-by-case basis to the extent permissible by Federal  law or regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> A DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU with an educational  institution may be suspended or terminated by DoD in these  circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU with an educational  institution may be terminated by the ASD(R&FM;) following written notice  and an opportunity to respond for the failure to comply with any element  of this part of the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU. In  addition, an otherwise qualified educational institution may be  suspended from participating in the tuition assistance program by the  ASD(R&FM;) following written notice and an opportunity to respond through  either the termination of an existing DoD Voluntary Education  Partnership MOU or the refusal by DoD to enter into a new DoD Voluntary  Education Partnership MOU upon indictment of the educational institution  or any senior official of the educational institution on a criminal  charge related to the operation of the educational institution. The  decision of the ASD(R&FM;) in either of these cases may be appealed to  the USD(P&R;), and the decision of the USD(P&R;) will be deemed to be the  final administrative action by DoD on the matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An otherwise qualified educational institution may also be  immediately suspended from participating in the tuition assistance  program through either the termination of an existing DoD Voluntary  Education Partnership MOU or the refusal to enter into a new DoD  Voluntary Education Partnership MOU by the USD(P&R;) on national security  grounds. Written notice of the action will be provided to the  educational institution, and, if practicable without damaging national  security, the written notice will include a short unclassified summary  of the reasons for the action. Such a decision of the USD(P&R;) is only  appealable to the Secretary of Defense, who has authorized the Deputy  Secretary of Defense to act on such an appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The authorities pursuant to this paragraph are not delegable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Guidelines for establishing, maintaining, and operating  voluntary education programs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Education programs established under  this part by each Military Service will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide for the academic, technical, intellectual, personal, and  professional development of Service members, thereby contributing to the  readiness of the Military Services and the quality of life of Service  members and their families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Increase Service members' opportunities for advancement and  leadership by reinforcing their academic skills and occupational  competencies with new skills and knowledge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lead to a credential, such as a high school diploma,  certificate, or college degree, signifying satisfactory completion of  the educational program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Include an academic skills program, which allows personnel to  upgrade their reading, writing, computation, and communication abilities  in support of academic skills and military occupations and careers.  Academic skills programs may include English as a Second Language,  mathematics and basic science.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Include programs and college offerings that support findings  from periodic needs assessments conducted by the appropriate DoD  installation official (normally the Education Services Officer) for  programs provided on the DoD installation. The DoD installation needs  assessment process is used to determine such items as staffing  requirements, course offerings, size of facilities, funding, or other  standards for delivery of educational programs. Duplication of course  offerings on a DoD installation should be avoided. However, the  availability of similar courses through correspondence or electronic  delivery will not be considered duplication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Be described in a publication or on-line source that includes  on-installation educational programs, programs available at nearby DoD  installations, and colleges and universities nearby the DoD  installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each Military Service, in cooperation with community educational  service providers, will provide support essential to operating effective  education programs.

The eBenefits portal is updated by VA to  facilitate access to school performance information and key federal  financial aid documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Continually assess the state of its voluntary education programs  and periodically conduct a formal needs assessment by the appropriate  DoD installation official (normally the Education Services Officer) to  ensure that the best possible programs are available to their members at  each DoD installation or in their State or area command for RC  personnel. It is essential that a formal needs assessment be conducted  if there is a significant change in the demographic profile of the DoD  installation population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Eligible adult family members of Service members, DoD civilian  employees and their eligible adult family members, and military retirees  may participate in installation postsecondary education programs on a  space-available basis at no cost to the individual Service TA programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> At locations where an educational program that is offered on a  DoD installation is not otherwise conveniently available outside the DoD  installation, civilians who are not directly employed by the DoD or  other Federal agencies, and who are not eligible adult family members of  DoD personnel, may be allowed to participate in DoD installation  educational programs. While such participation contributes to positive  community relations, participation must be on a student-funded, space- available basis at no cost to the individual Service TA programs, after  the registration of Service members, DoD civilian employees, eligible  adult family members, and military retirees. Additionally, a review of  these potential participants by the relevant DoD installation ethics  counselor may be required as part of the installation commander's access  requirements. Participation may also be subject to the terms of status- of-forces or other regulating agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Education centers will maintain liaison with appropriate State  planning and approving agencies and coordinating councils to ensure that  planning agencies for continuing, adult, or postsecondary education are  aware of the educational needs of military personnel located within  their jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In supporting a high school completion program, each Military  Service will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that all Service members with less than a high school  education have the opportunity to attain a high school diploma or its  equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that neither a Military Service nor DANTES issues a  certificate or similar document to Service members based on performance  on high school equivalency tests. Military Services will recognize  attainment of high school completion or equivalency only after a State-  or territory-approved agency has awarded the appropriate credential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pay 100 percent of the cost of high school equivalency  instruction or proficiency testing and credentialing for Service  members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure that Service sponsored high school diploma programs are  delivered by institutions that are State-funded or a Service component  program accredited by a regional accrediting body or recognized by a  State's secondary school authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for the responsible education advisor, on behalf of  the installation commander, to follow to provide voluntary education  programs and services from postsecondary educational institutions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Contacts by an educational institution with a Service member for the  purpose of asking or encouraging the member to sign up for one of the  educational institution's programs (assuming the program has some cost)  are considered personal commercial solicitations.

Preamble.</p><p class="depth0">a. Providing access to quality postsecondary education opportunities  is a strategic investment that enhances the U.S. Service member's  ability to support mission accomplishment and successfully return to  civilian life. A forward-leaning, lifelong learning environment is  fundamental to the maintenance of a mentally powerful and adaptive  leadership-ready force. Today's fast-paced and highly mobile  environment, where frequent deployments and mobilizations are required  to support the Nation's policies and objectives, requires DoD to sponsor  postsecondary educational programs using a variety of learning  modalities that include instructor-led courses offered both on- and off- installation, as well as distance learning options. All are designed to  support the professional and personal development and progress of the  Service members and our DoD civilian workforce.</p><p class="depth0">b. Making these postsecondary programs available to the military  community as a whole further provides Service members, their eligible  adult family members, DoD civilian employees, and military retirees ways  to advance their personal education and career aspirations and prepares  them for future vocational pursuits, both inside and outside of DoD.  This helps strengthen the Nation by producing a well-educated citizenry  and ensures the availability of a significant quality-of-life asset that  enhances recruitment and retention efforts in an all-volunteer force.</p><p class="depth0">2. Purpose.</p><p class="depth0">a. This MOU articulates the commitment and agreement educational  institutions provide to DoD by accepting funds via each Service's  tuition assistance (TA) program in exchange for education services.</p><p class="depth0">b. This MOU is not an obligation of funds, guarantee of program  enrollments by DoD personnel, their eligible adult family members, DoD  civilian employees, or retirees in an educational institution's academic  programs, or a guarantee for DoD installation access.</p><p class="depth0">c. This MOU covers courses delivered by educational institutions  through all modalities. These include, but are not limited to, classroom  instruction, distance education (i.e., web-based, CD-ROM, or multimedia)  and correspondence courses.</p><p class="depth0">d. This MOU includes high school programs, academic skills programs,  and adult education programs for military personnel and their eligible  adult family members.</p><p class="depth0">e. This MOU articulates regulatory and governing directives and  instructions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility of DoD recipients is governed by Federal law, DoD  Instruction 1322.25, DoD Directive 1322.08E, and the cognizant Military  Service's policies, regulations, and fiscal constraints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Postsecondary educational programs provided to Service members  using TA on DoD installations outside of the United States, will be  operated in accordance with guidance from DoD Instruction 1322.25, DoD  Instruction 1322.19, section 1212 of Public Law 99-145, as amended by  section 518 of Public Law 101-189; and under the terms of the Tri- Services contract currently in effect.</p><p class="depth0">f. This MOU is subject at all times to Federal law and the rules,  guidelines, and regulations of DoD. Any conflicts between this MOU and  such Federal law, rules, guidelines, and regulations will be resolved in  favor of the Federal law, rules, guidelines, or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Educational Institution (Including Certificate and Degree  Granting Educational Institutions) Requirements for TA. Educational  institutions must:</p><p class="depth0">a. Sign and adhere to requirements of this MOU, including Service- specific addendums as appropriate, prior to being eligible to receive TA  payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Those educational institutions that have a current Voluntary  Education Partnership MOU with DoD will sign this MOU:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> At the expiration of their current MOU (renewal);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> At the request of DoD or the specific Military Service holding a  separate current MOU. The DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU (which  includes the Service-specific addendums) is required for an educational  institution to participate in the DoD TA Program. An ``installation  MOU'' (which is separate from this MOU) is only required if an  educational institution is operating on a DoD installation. The  installation MOU:</p><p class="depth0">1. Contains the installation-unique requirements that the  responsible education advisor coordinated, documented, and retained; is  approved by the appropriate Service voluntary education representative;  and is presented to the installation commander for final approval.</p><p class="depth0">2.

This requirement applies not only to educational institutions  providing courses on DoD installations, but also to those educational  institutions that provide postsecondary instruction located off the DoD  installation or via DL. Educational institutions may be selected for  Third Party Education Assessment based on provider offerings (on- installation, off-installation, or DL), education benefits received  (large provider in terms of enrollments or TA funds), or an observed  promising practice. Educational institutions may also be selected as a  result of reports of non-compliance with the DoD Voluntary Education  Partnership MOU, complaint(s) received, or negative information received  from other government agencies and regulators. Educational institutions  demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve findings may receive a range  of penalties from a written warning to revocation of the DoD Voluntary  Education Partnership MOU and removal from participation in the DoD TA  Program. As appropriate, Third Party Education Assessment findings will  be shared with other government agencies/regulators including but not  limited to CFPB, VA, ED, DOJ, and FTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If an educational institution is operating on the DoD  installation, the educational institution will resolve the assessment  report findings and provide corrective actions taken within 6 months of  the Third Party Education Assessment to the responsible education  advisor on the DoD installation, the appropriate Service Voluntary  Education Chief, and the DoD Voluntary Education Chief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an educational institution is operating off the DoD  installation or via DL, the educational institution will resolve the  assessment report findings and provide corrective actions taken within 6  months of the Third Party Education Assessment to the DoD Voluntary  Education Chief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In instances when the resolution action cannot be completed  within the 6 month timeframe, the educational institution will submit a  status report every 3 months to the responsible education advisor on the  DoD installation if the educational institution is operating on the DoD  installation, and the DoD Voluntary Education Chief, until the  recommendation is resolved.</p><p class="depth0">f.

If an educational institution is not a member of SOC, in addition  to the requirements stated in paragraphs 3.a. through 3.l. of this MOU,  the educational institution will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disclose its transfer credit policies and articulated credit  transfer agreements before a Service member's enrollment. Disclosure  will explain acceptance of credits in transfer is determined by the  educational institution to which the student wishes to transfer and  refrain from making unsubstantiated representations to students about  acceptance of credits in transfer by another institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the educational institution accepts transfer credit from  other accredited institutions, then the educational institution agrees  to evaluate these credits in conformity with the principles set forth in  the Joint Statement on the Transfer and Award of Credit developed by  members of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and  Admissions Officers, the American Council on Education, and the Council  for Higher Education Accreditation. The educational institution will  then award appropriate credit, to the extent practicable within the  framework of its institutional mission and academic policies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Decisions about the amount of transfer credit accepted, and how  it will be applied to the student's program, will be left to the  educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disclose its policies on how they award academic credit for  prior learning experiences, including military training and experiential  learning opportunities provided by the Military Services, at or before a  Service member's enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In so far as the educational institution's policies generally  permit the award of credit for comparable prior learning experiences,  the educational institution agrees to evaluate the learning experiences  documented on the Service member's official Service transcripts, and, if  appropriate, award credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The JST is an official education transcripts tool for  documenting the recommended college credits for professional military  education, training courses, and occupational experiences of Service  members across the Services. The JST incorporates data from documents  such as the Army/ACE Registry Transcript System, the Sailor/Marine ACE  Registry Transcript System, the Community College of the Air Force  transcript, and the Coast Guard Institute transcript.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decisions about the amount of experiential learning credit  awarded, and how it will be applied to the student's program, will be  left to the educational institution. Once an educational institution has  evaluated a particular military training or experiential learning  opportunity for a given program, the educational institution may rely on  its prior evaluation to make future decisions about awarding credit to  Service members with the same military training and experience  documentation, provided that the course content has not changed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If general policy permits, award transfer credit or credit for  prior learning to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Replace a required course within the major;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Apply as an optional course within the major;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Apply as a general elective;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Apply as a basic degree requirement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Waive a prerequisite.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disclose to Service members any academic residency requirements  pertaining to the student's program of study, including total and any  final year or final semester residency requirement at or before the time  the student enrolls in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Disclose basic information about the educational institution's  programs and costs, including tuition and other charges to the Service  member. This information will be made readily accessible without  requiring the Service member to disclose any personal or contact  information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Before enrollment, provide Service members with information on  institutional ``drop/add,'' withdrawal, and readmission policies and  procedures to include information on the potential impact of military  duties (such as unanticipated deployments or mobilization, activation,  and temporary duty assignments) on the student's academic standing and  financial responsibilities. For example, a Service member's military  duties may require relocation to an area where he or she is unable to  maintain consistent computer connectivity with the educational  institution, which could have implications for the Service member's  enrollment status. This information will also include an explanation of  the educational institution's grievance policy and process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Conduct academic screening and competency testing; make course  placement based on student readiness.</p><p class="depth0">4. TA Program Requirements for Educational Institutions.</p><p class="depth0">a. One Single Tuition Rate. All Service members attending the same  educational institution, at the same location, enrolled in the same  course, will be charged the same tuition rate without regard to their  Service component. This single tuition rate includes active duty Service  members and the National Guard and Reservists who are activated under  Title 10 and using Title 10 Military Tuition Assistance, in order to  assure that tuition rate distinctions are not made based on the Service  members' branches of Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is understood tuition rates may vary by mode of delivery  (traditional or online), at the differing degree levels and programs,  and residency designations (in-state or out-of-state). Tuition rates may  also vary based on full-time or part-time status, daytime vs. evening  classes, or matriculation date, such as in the case of a guaranteed  tuition program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is also understood that some States have mandated State rates  for Guard and Reservists within the State. (Those Guard and Reservists  not activated on Title 10, U.S. Code orders).</p><p class="depth0">b. Course Enrollment Information. The educational institutions will  provide course enrollment, course withdrawal, course cancellation,  course completion or failure, grade, verification of degree completion,  and billing information to the TA issuing Service's education office, as  outlined in the Service's regulations and instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under section 1232g of title 20, United States Code (also known  as ``The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act'' and hereinafter  referred to as ``FERPA''), DoD recognizes that educational institutions  are required to obtain consent before sharing personally identifiable  non-directory information with a third party. Service members must  authorize the educational institutions to release and forward course  enrollment information required in 4.b. to DoD prior to approval of  course enrollment using tuition assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an educational institution wants to ensure confidentiality  during the transmission of data to the third party, then the educational  institution can contact the appropriate Service TA management point of  contact to discuss security and confidentiality concerns prior to  transmitting information.</p><p class="depth0">c. Degree Requirements and Evaluated Educational Plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Educational institutions will disclose general degree  requirements for the Service member's educational program (evaluated  educational plan) to the member and his or her Service before the  enrollment of the Service member at the educational institution. These  requirements, typically articulated in the educational institution's  course catalog, should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Include the total number of credits needed for graduation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Divide the coursework students must complete in accordance with  institutional academic policies into general education, required, and  elective courses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Articulate any additional departmental or graduate academic  requirements, such as satisfying institutional and major field grade  point average requirements, a passing grade in any comprehensive exams,  or completion of a thesis or dissertation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to providing degree requirements, the educational  institution will provide to Service members who have previous coursework  from other accredited institutions and relevant military training and  experiential learning an evaluated educational plan that indicates how  many, if any, transfer credits it intends to award and how these will be  applied toward the Service member's educational program. The evaluated  educational plan will be provided within 60 days after admission to the  educational institution in which the individual has selected a degree  program and all required official transcripts have been received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a Service member changes his or her educational goal or  major at the attending school and the Services' education advisor  approves the change, then the educational institution will provide a new  evaluated educational plan to the Service member and the Service within  60 days. Only courses listed in the Service member's evaluated  educational plan will be approved for TA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Degree requirements in effect at the time of each Service  member's enrollment will remain in effect for a period of at least 1  year beyond the program's standard length, provided the Service member  is in good academic standing and has been continuously enrolled or  received an approved academic   leave of absence. Adjustments to degree requirements may be made as a  result of formal changes to academic policy pursuant to institutional or  departmental determination, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> They go into effect at least 2 years after affected students  have been notified; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In instances when courses or programs are no longer available or  changes have been mandated by a State or accrediting body, the  educational institution will identify low or no cost solutions, working  with affected Service members to identify substitutions that would not  hinder the student from graduating in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Degree requirements and evaluated educational plans will meet  educational requirements for credentialing in stated career field and  graduates of a program will be eligible for relevant professional  license or certification. Educational institutions will disclose any  conditions (state or agency limitations) or additional requirements  (training, experience, or exams) required to obtain relevant  credentials.</p><p class="depth0">d. Approved and TA Eligible Courses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Approved Courses. If an eligible Service member decides to use  TA, educational institutions will enroll him or her only after the TA is  approved by the individual's Service. Service members will be solely  responsible for all tuition costs without this prior approval. This  requirement does not prohibit an educational institution from pre- registering a Service member in a course in order to secure a slot in  the course. If a school enrolls the Service member before the  appropriate Service approves Military TA, then the Service member could  be responsible for the tuition. All Military TA must be requested and  approved prior to the start date of the course. The Military TA is  approved on a course-by-course basis and only for the specific course(s)  and class dates that a Service member requests. If a military student  ``self-identifies'' their eligibility and the Service has not approved  the funding, then the Service member will be solely responsible for all  tuition costs, not the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> TA Eligible Courses. Courses will be considered eligible for TA  if they are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Part of an individual's evaluated educational plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prerequisites for courses within the individual's evaluated  educational plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required for acceptance into a higher-level degree program,  unless otherwise specified by Service regulations.</p><p class="depth0">e. Use of Financial Aid with TA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Top-Up'' eligible active duty DoD personnel may use their  Montgomery or Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefit in conjunction with TA funds  from their Service to cover those course costs to the Service member  that exceed the amount of TA paid by his or her Service. RC members who  qualify for Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits may use those benefits  concurrently with TA. RC members who have earned entitlement for the  Post-9/11 G.I. Bill can use both VA education benefits and TA, but VA  will only pay for the portion of tuition not covered by TA; therefore,  the combination of VA education benefits and TA will not exceed 100  percent of the actual costs of tuition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DoD personnel are entitled to consideration for all forms of  financial aid that educational institutions make available to students  at their home campus. Educational institution financial aid officers  will provide information and application processes for Title IV student  aid programs, scholarships, fellowships, grants, loans, etc., to DoD TA  recipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service members identified as eligible DoD TA recipients, who  qualify for Pell Grants through ED's student aid program, will have  their TA benefits applied to their educational institution's account  prior to the application of their Pell Grant funds to their account.  Unlike TA funds, which are tuition-restricted, Pell Grant funds are not  tuition-restricted and may be applied to other allowable charges on the  account.</p><p class="depth0">f. Administration of Tuition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Services will provide TA in accordance with DoD- and  Service-appropriate regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Educational institutions will comply with these requirements for  the return of TA funds:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Return any TA Program funds directly to the Military Service,  not to the Service member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Up to the start date, return all (100 percent) TA funds to the  appropriate Military Service when the Service member does not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> begin attendance at the institution or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> start a course, regardless of whether the student starts other  courses</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Return any TA funds paid for a course that is cancelled by the  educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Have an institutional policy that returns any unearned TA funds  on a proportional basis through at least the 60 percent portion of the  period for which the funds were provided. TA funds are earned  proportionally during an enrollment period, with unearned funds returned  based upon when a student stops attending. In instances when a Service  member stops attending due to a military service obligation, the  educational institution will work with the affected Service member to  identify solutions that will not result in a student debt for the  returned portion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tuition charged to a Service member will in no case exceed the  rate charged to nonmilitary students, unless agreed upon in writing by  both the educational institution and the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Educational institutions will provide their tuition charges for  each degree program to the Services on an annual basis. Any changes in  the tuition charges will be provided to and explained to all the  Services, as soon as possible, but not fewer than 90 days prior to  implementation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tuition charges at many public institutions are established by  entities over which they have no jurisdiction, such as State  legislatures and boards. As such, in some instances tuition decisions  will not be made within the 90-day requirement window.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When this happens, the educational institution will request a  waiver (via the DoD MOU Web page) and provide the Services with the new  tuition charges. To the extent practicable by State law or regulation,  Service members already enrolled will not be impacted by changes in  tuition charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> TA invoicing information is located in the Service-specific  addendums attached to this MOU.</p><p class="depth0">g. Course Cancellations. Educational institutions are responsible  for notifying Service members of class cancellations for both classroom  and DL courses.</p><p class="depth0">h. Materials and Electronic Accessibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Educational institutions will ensure that course materials are  readily available, either electronically or in print medium, and provide  information about where the student may obtain class materials at the  time of enrollment or registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Educational institution representatives will refrain from  encouraging or requiring students to purchase course materials prior to  confirmation of sufficient enrollments to conduct the class. Students  will be encouraged to verify course acceptance by CCAF (Air Force only)  or other program(s), with the responsible education advisor before  enrolling or requesting TA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Educational institutions will provide, where available,  electronic access to their main administrative and academic center's  library materials, professional services, relevant periodicals, books,  and other academic reference and research resources in print or online  format that are appropriate or necessary to support the courses offered.  Additionally, educational institutions will ensure adequate print and  non-print media resources to support all courses being offered are  available at base or installation library facilities, on-site  Institution resource areas, or via electronic transmission.</p><p class="depth0">i. Graduation Achievement Recognition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The educational institution will issue, at no cost to the  Government, documentation as proof of completion, such as a diploma or  certificate, to each student who completes the respective program  requirements and meets all financial obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with Service requirements, the educational  institution will report to the Service concerned those TA recipients who  have completed a certificate, diploma, or degree program. Reporting will  occur at least annually and include the degree level, major, and program  requirements completion date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The academic credentials for certificate, diploma, or degree  completion will reflect the degree-granting educational institution and  campus authorized to confer the degree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the Service member attends a branch of a large, multi-branch  university system, the diploma may indicate the credential of the  specific campus or branch of the educational institution from which the  student received his or her degree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Credentials will be awarded to Service members with the same  institutional designation as non-Service members who completed the same  course work for a degree from the same institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The educational institution will provide students with the  opportunity to participate in a graduation ceremony.</p><p class="depth0">j. Reporting Requirements and Performance Metrics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The educational institution will provide reports via electronic  delivery on all DoD TA recipients for programs and courses offered to  personnel as required by the cognizant Service. This includes, but is  not limited to, TA transactions, final course grades to include  incompletes and withdrawals, degrees awarded, certificates earned,  evaluated educational plans, courses offered, and military graduation.  Educational institutions providing face-to-face courses on a DoD  installation will provide a class roster to the responsible education  advisor. The class roster will include information such as the name of  the instructor, the first and last name of each student (military and  non-military), the course title, the class meeting day(s), the start and  ending time of the class, and the class location (e.g., building and  room number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All reporting and transmitting of this information will be done  in conformity with all applicable privacy laws, including FERPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Educational institutions will respond to these requests in a  timely fashion, which will vary based on the specific nature and scope  of the information requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cognizant Service may evaluate the educational institution's  overall effectiveness in administering its academic program, courses,  and customer satisfaction to DoD. A written report of the findings will  be provided to the educational institution. The educational institution  will have 90 calendar days to review the report, investigate if  required, and provide a written response to the findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Services may request reports from an educational institution  at any time, but not later than 2 years after termination of   the MOU with such educational institution. Responses to all requests for  reports will be provided within a reasonable period of time, and  generally within 14 calendar days. Institutional response time will  depend on the specific information sought by the Services in the report.</p><p class="depth0">5. Requirements and Responsibilities for the Delivery of On- Installation Voluntary Education Programs and Services</p><p class="depth0">a. The requirements in this section pertain to educational  institutions operating on a DoD installation.</p><p class="depth0">An installation MOU:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is required if an educational institution is operating on a DoD  installation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains only the installation-unique requirements coordinated  by the responsible education advisor, with concurrence from the  appropriate Service voluntary education representative, and approved by  the installation commander.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cannot conflict with the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU  and governing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">b. Educational institutions will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agree to have a separate installation MOU if they have a Service  agreement to provide on-installation courses or degree programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comply with the installation-unique requirements in the  installation MOU.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agree to coordinate degree programs offered on the DoD  installation with the responsible education advisor, who will receive  approval from the installation commander, prior to the opening of  classes for registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Admit candidates to the educational institution's on- installation programs at their discretion; however, priority for  registration in DoD installation classes will be given in the following  order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Service members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Federally funded DoD civilian employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Eligible adult family members of Service members and DoD  civilian employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Military retirees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Non-DoD personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Provide the responsible education advisor, as appropriate, a  tentative annual schedule of course offerings to ensure that the  educational needs of the military population on the DoD installation are  met and to ensure no course or scheduling conflicts with other on- installation programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Provide instructors for their DoD installation courses who meet  the criteria established by the educational institution to qualify for  employment as a faculty member on the main administrative and academic  center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Inform the responsible education advisor about cancellations for  classroom-based classes on DoD installations per the guidelines set  forth in the separate installation MOU.</p><p class="depth0">c. The Services' designated installation representative (usually the  responsible education advisor), will be responsible for determining the  local voluntary education program needs for the serviced military  population and for selecting the off-duty educational programs to be  provided on the DoD installation, in accordance with the Services'  policies.
