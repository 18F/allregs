                                Sec. 37.865  Should my patent provision include march-in rights?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Your TIA's patent rights provision should include the Bayh-Dole  march-in rights clause at paragraph (j)(1) of 37 CFR 401.14, or an  equivalent clause, concerning actions that the Government may take to  obtain the right to use subject inventions, if the recipient fails to  take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject  inventions within a reasonable time. The march-in provision may be  modified to best meet the needs of the program. However, only  infrequently should the march-in provision be entirely removed (e.g.,  you may wish to do so if a recipient is providing most of the funding  for a research project, with the Government providing a much smaller  share).</p>
