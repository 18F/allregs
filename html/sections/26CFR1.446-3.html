The purpose of this section is to enable the clear  reflection of the income and deductions from notional principal  contracts by prescribing accounting methods that reflect the economic  substance of such contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions and scope--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notional principal contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. A notional principal contract is a financial instrument that  provides for the payment of amounts by one party to another at specified  intervals calculated by reference to a specified index upon a notional  principal amount in exchange for specified consideration or a promise to  pay similar amounts. An agreement between a taxpayer and a qualified  business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) of the taxpayer, or among  qualified business units of the same taxpayer, is not a notional  principal contract because a taxpayer cannot enter into a contract with  itself. Notional principal contracts governed by this section include  interest rate swaps, currency swaps, basis swaps, interest rate caps,  interest rate floors, commodity swaps, equity swaps, equity index swaps,  and similar agreements. A collar is not itself a notional principal  contract, but certain caps and floors that comprise a collar may be  treated as a single notional principal contract under paragraph  (f)(2)(v)(C) of this section. A contract may be a notional principal  contract governed by this section even though the term of the contract  is subject to termination or extension. Each confirmation under a master  agreement to enter into agreements governed by this section is treated  as a separate notional principal contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excluded contracts. A contract described in section 1256(b), a  futures contract, a forward contract, and an option are not notional  principal contracts. An instrument or contract that constitutes  indebtedness under general principles of Federal income tax law is not a  notional principal contract. An option or forward contract that entitles  or obligates a person to enter into a notional principal contract is not  a notional principal contract, but payments made under such an option or  forward contract may be governed by paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transactions within section 475. To the extent that the rules  provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section are inconsistent with  the rules that apply to any notional principal contract that is governed  by section 475 and regulations thereunder, the rules of section 475 and  the regulations thereunder govern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transactions within section 988. To the extent that the rules  provided in this section are inconsistent with the rules that apply to  any notional principal contract that is also a section 988 transaction  or that is integrated with other property or debt pursuant to section  988(d), the rules of section 988 and the regulations thereunder govern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specified index. A specified index is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fixed rate, price, or amount;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A fixed rate, price, or amount applicable in one or more  specified periods followed by one or more different fixed rates, prices,  or amounts applicable in other periods;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An index that is based on objective financial information (as  defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An interest rate index that is regularly used in normal lending  transactions between a party to the contract and unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notional principal amount. For purposes of this section, a  notional principal amount is any specified amount of money or property  that, when multiplied by a specified index, measures a party's rights  and obligations under the contract, but is not borrowed or loaned  between the parties as part of the contract. The notional principal  amount may vary over the term of the contract, provided that it is set  in advance or varies based on objective financial information (as  defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Related person and party to the  contract. A related person is a person related (within the meaning of  section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to one of the parties to the notional  principal contract or a member of the same consolidated group (as  defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(h)) as one of the parties to the contract. For  purposes of this paragraph (c), a related person is considered to be a  party to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Objective financial information. For purposes of this paragraph  (c), objective financial information is any current, objectively  determinable financial or economic information that is not within the  control of any of the parties to the contract and is not unique to one  of the parties' circumstances (such as one party's dividends, profits,  or the value of its stock). Thus, for example, a notional principal  amount may be based on a broadly-based equity index or the outstanding  balance of a pool of mortgages, but not on the value of a party's stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dealer in notional principal contracts. A dealer in notional  principal contracts is a person who regularly offers to enter into,  assume, offset, assign, or otherwise terminate positions in notional  principal contracts with customers in the ordinary course of a trade or  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Taxable year of inclusion and deduction. For all purposes of the  Code, the net income or net deduction from a notional principal contract  for a taxable year is included in or deducted from gross income for that  taxable year. The net income or net deduction from a notional principal  contract for a taxable year equals the total of all of the periodic  payments that are recognized from that contract for the taxable year  under paragraph (e) of this section and all of the nonperiodic payments  that are recognized from that contract for the taxable year under  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Periodic payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Periodic payments are  payments made or received pursuant to a notional principal contract that  are payable at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of  the contract (including any extension periods provided for in the  contract), that are based on a specified index described in paragraph  (c)(2)(i), (iii), or (iv) of this section (appropriately adjusted for  the length of the interval), and that are based on either a single  notional principal amount or a notional principal amount that varies  over the term of the contract in the same proportion as the notional  principal amount that measures the other party's payments. Payments to  purchase or sell a cap or a floor, however, are not periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recognition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. All taxpayers, regardless of  their method of accounting, must recognize the ratable daily portion of  a periodic payment for the taxable year to which that portion relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and the corresponding portion  of the actual payment that becomes fixed under the contract is taken  into account as an adjustment to the net income or net deduction from  the notional principal contract for the taxable year during which the  payment becomes fixed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notional principal amount set in arrears. Rules similar to the  rules of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section apply if the amount of a  periodic payment is not determinable at the end of a taxable year  because the notional principal amount is not fixed until a date that  occurs after the end of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On April 1, 1995,  A enters into a contract with unrelated counterparty B under which, for  a term of five years, A is obligated to make a payment to B each April  1, beginning April 1, 1996, in an amount equal to the London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR), as determined on the immediately preceding April  1, multiplied by a notional principal amount of $100 million. Under the  contract, B is obligated to make a payment to A each April 1, beginning  April 1, 1996, in an amount equal to 8% multiplied by the same notional  principal amount. A and B are calendar year taxpayers that use the  accrual method of accounting. On April 1, 1995, LIBOR is 7.80%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This contract is a notional principal contract as defined by  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and both LIBOR and a fixed interest  rate of 8% are specified indices under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  All of the payments to be made by A and B are periodic payments under  paragraph (e)(1) of this section because each party's payments are based  on a specified index described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (c)(2)(i)  of this section, respectively, are payable at periodic intervals of one  year or less throughout the term of the contract, and are based on a  single notional principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under the terms of the swap agreement, on April 1, 1996, B is  obligated to make a payment to A of $8,000,000 (8%x$100,000,000) and A  is obligated to make a payment to B of $7,800,000 (7.80%x$100,000,000).  Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the ratable daily portions  for 1995 are the amounts of these periodic payments that are  attributable to A's and B's taxable year ending December 31, 1995. The  ratable daily portion of the 8% fixed leg is $6,010,929 (275 days/366  daysx$8,000,000), and the ratable daily portion of the floating leg is  $5,860,656 (275 days/366 daysx$7,800,000). The net amount for the  taxable year is the difference between the ratable daily portions of the  two periodic payments, or $150,273 ($6,010,929--$5,860,656).  Accordingly, A has net income of $150,273 from this swap for 1995, and B  has a corresponding net deduction of $150,273.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The $49,727 unrecognized balance of the $200,000 net periodic  payment that is made on April 1, 1996, is included in A's and B's net  income or net deduction from the contract for 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section,  neither party would accrue any income or deduction from the swap for the  period from February 1, 1995, through March 31, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On April 1, 1995, C enters into a contract with unrelated  counterparty D under which, for a period of five years, C is obligated  to make a fixed payment to D each April 1, beginning April 1, 1996, in  an amount equal to 8% multiplied by a notional principal amount of $100  million. D is obligated to make semi-annual payments to C each April 1  and October 1, beginning October 1, 1995, in an amount equal to one-half  of the LIBOR amount as of the first day of the preceding 6-month period  multiplied by the notional principal amount. The payments are to be  calculated using a 30/360 day convention. C is a calendar year taxpayer  that uses the accrual method of accounting. D is a calendar year  taxpayer that uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of  accounting. LIBOR is 7.80% on April 1, 1995, and 7.46% on October 1,  1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This contract is a notional principal contract as defined by  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and LIBOR and the fixed interest rate  of 8% are each specified indices under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  All of the payments to be made by C and D are periodic payments under  paragraph (e)(1) of this section because they are each based on  appropriate specified indices, are payable at periodic intervals of one  year or less   throughout the term of the contract, and are based on a single notional  principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under the terms of the swap agreement, D pays C $3,900,000  (0.5x7.8%x$100,000,000) on October 1, 1995. In addition, D is obligated  to pay C $3,730,000 (0.5x7.46%x$100,000,000) on April 1, 1996. C is  obligated to pay D $8,000,000 on April 1, 1996. Under paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section, C's and D's ratable daily portions for 1995  are the amounts of the periodic payments that are attributable to their  taxable year ending December 31, 1995. The ratable daily portion of the  8% fixed leg is $6,000,000 (270 days/360 daysx$8,000,000), and the  ratable daily portion of the floating leg is $5,765,000 ($3,900,000 +  (90 days/180 daysx$3,730,000)). Thus, C's net deduction from the  contract for 1995 is $235,000 ($6,000,000--$5,765,000) and D reports  $235,000 of net income from the contract for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The net unrecognized balance of $135,000 ($2,000,000 balance of  the fixed leg--$1,865,000 balance of the floating leg) is included in  C's and D's net income or net deduction from the contract for 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The  facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A's obligation to make  payments based upon LIBOR is determined by reference to LIBOR on the day  each payment is due. LIBOR is 8.25% on December 31, 1995, and 8.16% on  April 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> On December 31, 1995, the amount that A is obligated to pay B is  not known because it will not become fixed until April 1, 1996. Under  paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the ratable daily portion of the  periodic payment from A to B for 1995 is based on the value of LIBOR on  December 31, 1995 (unless A or B determines that the value of LIBOR on  that day does not reasonably estimate the value of the specified index).  Thus, the ratable daily portion of the floating leg is $6,198,770 (275  days/366 daysx8.25%x$100,000,000), while the ratable daily portion of  the fixed leg is $6,010,929 (275 days/366 daysx$8,000,000). The net  amount for 1995 on this swap is $187,841 ($6,198,770--$6,010,929).  Accordingly, B has $187,841 of net income from the swap in 1995, and A  has a net deduction of $187,841.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> On April 1, 1996, A makes a net payment to B of $160,000  ($8,160,000 payment on the floating leg--$8,000,000 payment on the fixed  leg). For purposes of determining their net income or net deduction from  this contract for the year ended December 31, 1996, B and A must adjust  the net income and net deduction they recognized in 1995 by $67,623 (275  days/366 daysx($8,250,000 presumed payment on the floating leg-- $8,160,000 actual payment on the floating leg)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Nonperiodic payments--(1) Definition. A nonperiodic payment is  any payment made or received with respect to a notional principal  contract that is not a periodic payment (as defined in paragraph (e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  of this section) or a termination payment (as defined in paragraph (h)  of this section). Examples of nonperiodic payments are the premium for a  cap or floor agreement (even if it is paid in installments), the payment  for an off-market swap agreement, the prepayment of part or all of one  leg of a swap, and the premium for an option to enter into a swap if and  when the option is exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recognition rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. All taxpayers, regardless of  their method of accounting, must recognize the ratable daily portion of  a nonperiodic payment for the taxable year to which that portion  relates. Generally, a nonperiodic payment must be recognized over the  term of a notional principal contract in a manner that reflects the  economic substance of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rule for swaps. A nonperiodic payment that relates to a  swap must be recognized over the term of the contract by allocating it  in accordance with the forward rates (or, in the case of a commodity,  the forward prices) of a series of cash-settled forward contracts that  reflect the specified index and the notional principal amount. For  purposes of this allocation, the forward rates or prices used to  determine the amount of the nonperiodic payment will be respected, if  reasonable. See paragraph (f)(4) Example 7 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section) for swaps entered into or acquired in its  capacity as a dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prepaid swaps. An upfront payment on a swap may be amortized by  assuming that the nonperiodic payment represents the present value of a  series of equal payments made throughout the term of the swap contract  (the level payment method), adjusted as appropriate to take account   of increases or decreases in the notional principal amount. The discount  rate used in this calculation must be the rate (or rates) used by the  parties to determine the amount of the nonperiodic payment. If that rate  is not readily ascertainable, the discount rate used must be a rate that  is reasonable under the circumstances. Under this method, an upfront  payment is allocated by dividing each equal payment into its principal  recovery and time value components. The principal recovery components of  the equal payments are treated as periodic payments that are deemed to  be made on each of the dates that the swap contract provides for  periodic payments by the payor of the nonperiodic payment or, if none,  on each of the dates that the swap contract provides for periodic  payments by the recipient of the nonperiodic payment. The time value  component is needed to compute the amortization of the nonperiodic  payment, but is otherwise disregarded. See paragraph (f)(4) Example 5 of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other nonperiodic swap payments. Nonperiodic payments on a swap  other than an upfront payment may be amortized by treating the contract  as if it provided for a single upfront payment (equal to the present  value of the nonperiodic payments) and a loan between the parties. The  discount rate (or rates) used in determining the deemed upfront payment  and the time value component of the deemed loan is the same as the rate  (or rates) used in the level payment method. The single upfront payment  is then amortized under the level payment method described in paragraph  (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The time value component of the loan is  not treated as interest, but, together with the amortized amount of the  deemed upfront payment, is recognized as a periodic payment. See  paragraph (f)(4) Example 6 of this section. If both parties make  nonperiodic payments, this calculation is done separately for the  nonperiodic payments made by each party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, straight-line or accelerated amortization of  a cap premium is generally not permitted. See paragraph (f)(4) Examples  1 and 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, adjusted as appropriate to take account of  increases or decreases in the notional principal amount. The alternative  methods may not be used by a dealer in notional principal contracts (as  defined in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section) for caps or floors  entered into or acquired in its capacity as a dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section. See paragraph (f)(4) Example 3  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section. Under the level payment  method, a cap or floor premium paid in level annual installments over  the term of the contract is effectively included or deducted from income  ratably, in accordance with the level payments. See paragraph (f)(4)  Example 4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special method for collars. A taxpayer may also treat a cap and  a floor   that comprise a collar as a single notional principal contract and may  amortize the net nonperiodic payment to enter into the cap and floor  over the term of the collar in accordance with the methods prescribed in  this paragraph (f)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additional methods. The Commissioner may, by a revenue ruling  or a revenue procedure published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin,  provide alternative methods for allocating nonperiodic payments that  relate to a notional principal contract to each year of the contract.  See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Term of extendible or terminable contracts. For purposes of this  paragraph (f), the term of a notional principal contract that is subject  to extension or termination is the reasonably expected term of the  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On January  1, 1995, when LIBOR is 8%, F pays unrelated party E $600,000 for a  contract that obligates E to make a payment to F each quarter equal to  one-quarter of the excess, if any, of three-month LIBOR over 9% with  respect to a notional principal amount of $25 million. Both E and F are  calendar year taxpayers. E provides F with a schedule of allocable  premium amounts indicating that the cap was priced according to a  reasonable variation of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula and  that the total premium is allocable to the following periods:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Pricing</p><p class="depth0">allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1995....................................................         $55,000 1996....................................................         225,000 1997....................................................         320,000</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">$600,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This contract is a notional principal contract as defined by  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and LIBOR is a specified index under  paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Any payments made by E to F are  periodic payments under paragraph (e)(1) of this section because they  are payable at periodic intervals of one year or less throughout the  term of the contract, are based on an appropriate specified index, and  are based on a single notional principal amount. The $600,000 cap  premium paid by F to E is a nonperiodic payment as defined in paragraph  (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Black-Scholes model is recognized in the financial industry  as a standard technique for pricing interest rate cap agreements.  Therefore, because E has used a reasonable option pricing model, the  schedule generated by E is consistent with the economic substance of the  cap, and may be used by both E and F for calculating their ratable daily  portions of the cap premium. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section,  E recognizes the ratable daily portion of the cap premium as income, and  F recognizes the ratable daily portion of the cap premium as a deduction  based on the pricing schedule.

When the termination payment is recognized, the party also  recognizes any other payments that have been made or received pursuant  to the notional principal contract, but that have not been recognized  under paragraph (d) of this section. If only a proportionate part of a  party's rights and obligations is extinguished, assigned, or exchanged,  then only that proportion of the unrecognized payments is recognized  under the previous sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxable year of inclusion and deduction by assignees. A  termination payment made or received by an assignee pursuant to an  assignment of a notional principal contract is recognized by the  assignee under the rules of paragraphs (f) and (g)(4) or (g)(5) of this  section as a nonperiodic payment for the notional principal contract  that is in effect after the assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> applies whether or not the original  notional principal contract is terminated as a result of the assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substance over form. Any economic benefit that is given or  received by a taxpayer in lieu of a termination payment is a termination  payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (h). The contracts in the examples are not hedging  transactions as defined in Sec. 1.1221-2(b), and all of the examples  assume that no loss-deferral rules apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On January 1, 1995, P  enters into an interest rate swap agreement with unrelated counterparty  Q under which, for a term of seven years, P is obligated to make annual  payments based on 10% and Q is obligated to make semi-annual payments  based on LIBOR and a notional principal amount of $100 million. P and Q  are both calendar year taxpayers. On January 1, 1997, when the fixed  rate on a comparable LIBOR swap has fallen to 9.5%, P pays Q $1,895,393  to terminate the swap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The payment from P to Q extinguishes the swap contract and is a  termination payment, as defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for  both parties. Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, P  recognizes a loss of $1,895,393 in 1997 and Q recognizes $1,895,393 of  gain in 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as  in Example 1, except that on January 1, 1997, P pays unrelated party R  $1,895,393 to assume all of P's rights and obligations under the swap  with Q. In return for this payment, R agrees to pay 10% of $100 million  annually to Q and to receive LIBOR payments from Q for the remaining  five years of the swap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The payment from P to R terminates P's interest in the swap  contract with Q and is a termination payment, as defined in paragraph  (h)(1) of this section, for P. Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, P  recognizes a loss of $1,895,393 in 1997. Whether Q also has a  termination payment with respect to the payment from P to R is  determined under section 1001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the assignment payment  that R receives from P is a nonperiodic payment for an interest rate  swap. Because the assignment payment is not a significant nonperiodic  payment within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, R  amortizes the $1,895,393 over the five year term of the swap agreement  under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The  facts are the same as in Example 2, except that on January 1, 1995, Q  paid P a yield adjustment fee to enter into the seven year interest rate  swap. In accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, P and Q  included the ratable daily portions of that nonperiodic payment in their  net income or net deduction from the contract for 1995 and 1996. On  January 1, 1997, $300,000 of the nonperiodic payment has not yet been  recognized by P and Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, P recognizes a loss of  $1,595,393 ($1,895,393-$300,000) in 1997. R accounts for the termination  payment in the same way it did in Example 2; the existence of an  unamortized payment with respect to the original swap has no effect on  R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On January 1, 1995,  S enters into an interest rate swap agreement with unrelated  counterparty T under which, for a term of five years, S will make annual  payments at 10% and T will make annual payments at LIBOR on a notional  principal amount of $50 million. On January 1, 1996, unrelated party U  pays T $15,849,327 for the right to receive the four remaining  $5,000,000 payments from S. Under the terms of the agreement between S  and T, S is notified of this assignment, and S is contractually bound  thereafter to make its payments to U on the appropriate payment dates.  S's obligation to pay U is conditioned on T making its LIBOR payment to  S on the appropriate payment dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because T has assigned to U its rights to the fixed rate  payments, but not its floating rate obligations under the notional  principal contract, U's payment to T is not a termination payment as  defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, but is covered by paragraph  (h)(4)(i) of this section. The economic substance of the transaction  between T and U is a loan that does not affect the way that S and T  account for the notional principal contract under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Anti-abuse rule. If a taxpayer enters into a transaction with a  principal purpose of applying the rules of this section to produce a  material distortion of income, the Commissioner may depart from the  rules of this section as necessary to reflect the appropriate timing of  income and deductions from the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date. These regulations are effective for notional  principal contracts entered into on or after December 13, 1993.  [T.D. 8491, 58 FR 53128, Oct. 14, 1993; 59 FR 9411, Feb. 28, 1994, as  amended by T.D. 8554, 59 FR 36358, July 18, 1994]</p>
