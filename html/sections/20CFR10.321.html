                                Sec. 10.321  What happens if the opinion of the physician selected   employee?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If one medical opinion holds more probative value, OWCP will  base its determination of entitlement on that medical conclusion (see  Sec. 10.502). A difference in medical opinion sufficient to be  considered a conflict occurs when two reports of virtually equal weight  and rationale reach opposing conclusions (see James P. Roberts, 31 ECAB  1010 (1980)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a conflict exists between the medical opinion of the  employee's physician and the medical opinion of either a second opinion  physician or an OWCP medical adviser or consultant, OWCP shall appoint a  third physician to make an examination (see Sec. 10.502). This is  called a referee or impartial examination. OWCP will select a physician  who is qualified in the appropriate specialty and who has had no prior  connection with the case. The employee is not entitled to have anyone  present at the examination unless OWCP decides that exceptional  circumstances exist. For example, where a hearing-impaired employee  needs an interpreter, the presence of an interpreter would be allowed.  Also, a case file may be sent for referee or impartial medical review  where there is no need for an actual examination, or where the employee  is deceased.</p>
