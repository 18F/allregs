                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under ACEP-ALE, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity with which NRCS has entered into an ACEP-ALE cooperative agreement. The easement deed will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with ACEP-ALE goals and objectives for the term of the easement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Written pending offers by an eligible entity must be for acquiring an easement in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent easement. In such cases where State law limits the term of a conservation easement, the easement term will be for the maximum duration allowed under State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The eligible entity may use its own terms and conditions in the agricultural land easement deed, but the agricultural land easement deed must contain the minimum deed requirements as specified by NRCS in the cooperative agreement, either in the deed or through an addendum that is incorporated therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For eligible entities that have not been certified, the deed document must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use as provided herein:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The eligible entity must submit individual agricultural land easement deeds to NRCS at least 90 days before the planned easement purchase date and be approved by NRCS in advance of use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligible entities with multiple eligible parcels in a cooperative agreement may submit an agricultural land easement deed template for review and approval. The deed templates must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS may conduct an additional review of the agricultural land easement deeds for individual parcels prior to the execution of the easement deed by the landowner and the eligible entity to ensure that they contain the same language as approved by National Headquarters and that the appropriate site-specific information has been included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NRCS reserves the right to require additional specific language or require removal of language in the agricultural land easement deed to ensure the enforceability of the easement deed, protect the interests of the United States, or to otherwise ensure ALE purposes will be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Among the minimum deed requirements specified in the cooperative agreement, the deed must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include a right of enforcement clause for NRCS. NRCS will specify the terms for the right of enforcement clause, including that such interest in the agricultural land easement remains in effect for the duration of the easement and any changes that affect NRCS's interest in the agricultural land easement must be reviewed and approved by NRCS under Sec. 1468.6 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure compliance with an agricultural land easement plan that is provided by the eligible entity in consultation with the landowner, approved by NRCS, and implemented according to NRCS requirements. NRCS may provide technical assistance for the development or implementation of the agricultural land easement plan. If the parcel contains highly erodible land, the conservation plan component of the agricultural land easement plan will be developed and managed in accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985 and its associated regulations. The access must be sufficient to provide the United States ingress and egress to the easement area to ensure compliance pursuant to its right of enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify that impervious surfaces will not exceed 2 percent of the ACEP-ALE easement area, excluding NRCS-approved conservation practices unless NRCS grants a waiver as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The eligible entity may request a waiver of the 2 percent impervious surface limitation at the time that a parcel is approved for funding,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> NRCS may waive the 2 percent impervious surface limitation on an individual easement basis, provided that no more than 10 percent of the easement area is covered by impervious surfaces,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before waiving the 2 percent limitation, NRCS will consider, at a minimum, population density; the ratio of open, prime, and other important farmland versus impervious surfaces on the easement area; the impact to water

quality concerns in the area; the type of agricultural operation; parcel size; and the purposes for which the easement was acquired,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Eligible entities may submit an impervious surface limitation waiver process to NRCS for review and consideration. The eligible entities must apply any approved impervious surface limitation waiver processes on an individual easement basis, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> NRCS will not approve blanket waivers or entity blanket waiver processes of the impervious surface limitation. All ACEP-ALE easements must include language limiting the amount of impervious surfaces within the easement area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include an indemnification clause requiring the landowner to indemnify and hold harmless the United States from any liability arising from or related to the property enrolled in ACEP-ALE. This provision cannot be waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include an amendment clause requiring that any changes to the easement deed after its recordation must be consistent with the purposes of the agricultural land easement and this part. Any substantive amendment, including any subordination of the terms of the easement or modifications, exchanges, or terminations of the easement area, must be approved by NRCS prior to recordation or else the action is null and void.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prohibit commercial and industrial activities except those activities that NRCS has determined are consistent with the agricultural use of the land.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Prohibit the subdivision of the property subject to the agricultural land easement, except where state or local regulations explicitly require subdivision to construct residences for employees working on the property or where otherwise authorized by NRCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Include specific protections related to the purposes for which the agricultural land easement is being purchased, including provisions to protect historic or archaeological resources or grasslands of special environmental significance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other minimum deed terms specified by NRCS to ensure that ACEP-ALE purposes are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NRCS will make available for an eligible entity's use a standard set of minimum deed terms that could be wholly incorporated along with the eligible entity's own deed terms into the agricultural land easement deed, or as an addendum that is attached and incorporated by reference into the deed. If an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms, NRCS and the eligible entity will identify in the cooperative agreement those minimum standard deed terms as a requirement and the review of individual deeds may not be required. The minimum standard deed terms will specify that if such terms conflict with other terms of the deed, the NRCS terms superseded and prevail. NRCS may place priority on applications where an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The eligible entity will acquire, hold, manage, monitor, and enforce the easement. The eligible entity may have the option to enter into an agreement with a governmental or private organizations that have no property rights or interests in the easement area to carry out easement monitoring, management and enforcement responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> All agricultural land easement deeds acquired with ACEP-ALE funds must be recorded. The eligible entity will provide proof of recordation to NRCS within the timeframe specified in the cooperative agreement.</p>
