                            <p class="depth0">Each appraiser selected under Sec. 403.26(a)(2) shall receive as compensation a reasonable fee not to exceed $15.00 per hour or portion thereof for the performance of such appraiser's duties in appraising property seized as subject to forfeiture under the internal revenue laws and this part.
Because this regulation is nonsubstantive, liberalizing and essentially procedural, it is found unnecessary to issue it with notice and public procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that section.
