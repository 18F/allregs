                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each provider of operator services shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify itself, audibly and distinctly, to the consumer at the  beginning of each telephone call and before the consumer incurs any  charge for the call;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permit the consumer to terminate the telephone call at no charge  before the call is connected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclose immediately to the consumer, upon request and at no  charge to the consumer--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A quotation of its rates or charges for the call;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The methods by which such rates or charges will be collected;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The methods by which complaints concerning such rates,  charges, or collection practices will be resolved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclose, audibly and distinctly to the consumer, at no charge  and before connecting any interstate non-access code operator service  call, how to obtain the total cost of the call, including any aggregator  surcharge, or the maximum possible total cost of the call, including any  aggregator surcharge, before providing further oral advice to the  consumer on how to proceed to make the call. The oral disclosure  required in this subsection shall instruct consumers that they may  obtain applicable rate and surcharge quotations either, at the option of  the provider of operator services, by dialing no more than two digits or  by remaining on the line. The phrase ``total cost of the call'' as used  in this paragraph means both the variable (duration-based) charges for  the call and the total per-call charges, exclusive of taxes, that the  carrier, or its billing agent, may collect from the consumer for the  call. It does not include additional charges that may be assessed and  collected without the involvement of the carrier, such as a hotel  surcharge billed by a hotel. Such charges are addressed in paragraph (b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each aggregator shall post on or near the telephone instrument,  in plain view of consumers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and toll-free telephone number of the  provider of operator services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for CMRS aggregators, a written disclosure that the rates  for all operator-assisted calls are available on request, and that  consumers have a right to obtain access to the interstate common carrier  of their choice and may contact their preferred interstate common  carriers for information on accessing that carrier's service using that  telephone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a pay telephone, the local coin rate for the pay  telephone location; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the Consumer Information Bureau of the  Commission (Federal Communications Commission, Consumer Information  Bureau, Consumer Complaints--Telephone, Washington, D.C. 20554), to  which the consumer may direct complaints regarding operator services. An   existing posting that displays the address that was required prior to  the amendment of this rules (i.e., the address of the Common Carrier  Bureau's Enforcement Division, which no longer exists) may remain until  such time as the posting is replaced for any other purpose. Any posting  made after the effective date of this amendment must display the updated  address (i.e., the address of the Consumer Information Bureau).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Updating of postings. The posting required by this section shall  be updated as soon as practicable following any change of the carrier  presubscribed to provide interstate service at an aggregator location,  but no later than 30 days following such change. This requirement may be  satisfied by applying to a payphone a temporary sticker displaying the  required posting information, provided that any such temporary sticker  shall be replaced with permanent signage during the next regularly  scheduled maintenance visit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of state law or regulation. The requirements of paragraph  (b) of this section shall not apply to an aggregator in any case in  which State law or State regulation requires the aggregator to take  actions that are substantially the same as those required in paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each provider of operator services shall ensure, by contract or  tariff, that each aggregator for which such provider is the  presubscribed provider of operator services is in compliance with the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
