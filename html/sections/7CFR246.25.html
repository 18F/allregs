Financial and Program reports shall be certified as to their completeness and accuracy by the person given that responsibility by the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Use of reports. FNS will use State agency reports to measure progress in achieving objectives set forth in the State Plan, and this part, or other State agency performance plans. If it is determined, through review of State agency reports, Program or financial analysis, or an audit, that a State agency is not meeting the objectives set forth in its State Plan, FNS may request additional information including, but not limited to, reasons for failure to achieve its objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Extension of reporting deadline. FNS may extend the due date for any Financial and Participation Report upon receiving a justified request from the State agency. The State agency should not wait until the due date if an extension is to be requested, but should submit the request as soon as the need is known. Failure by a State agency to

submit a report by its due date may result in appropriate enforcement actions by FNS in accordance with Sec. 246.19(a)(2), including withholding of further grant payments, suspension or termination of the grant.
