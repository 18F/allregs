That decision is solely within the ONRR Director's and the Secretary's discretion. The ONRR Director's decision, which the Secretary concurs in, is the final decision for the Department of the Interior. The ONRR Director may approve a State's request for delegation only if, based upon the State's delegation proposal and the hearing record, the ONRR Director finds that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is likely that the State will provide adequate resources to achieve the purposes of the Act;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State has demonstrated that it will effectively and faithfully administer the ONRR regulations under the Act in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of section 205 of the Act;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Such delegation will not create an unreasonable burden on any lessee;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State agrees to adopt standardized reporting procedures ONRR prescribes for royalty and production accounting purposes, unless the State and all affected parties (including ONRR) otherwise agree;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State agrees to follow and adhere to regulations and guidelines ONRR issues under the mineral leasing laws regarding valuation of production; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where necessary for a State to carry out and enforce a delegated activity, the State agrees to enact such laws and promulgate such regulations as are consistent with relevant Federal laws and regulations.
