                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of proposed determination of ineligibility. If SBA is unable to verify that the concern qualifies as an EDWOSB or WOSB, then the D/GC will send the concern a written notice explaining the reasons SBA believes the concern did not qualify at the time of certification or does not qualify as an EDWOSB or WOSB. The notice will advise the concern that it has fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the notice to respond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SBA determination. Following the fifteen (15) day response period, the D/GC or designee will consider the reasons of proposed ineligibility and any information the concern submitted in response, and will send the concern a written decision with its findings. The D/GC's decision is effective immediately and remains in full force and effect unless a new examination verifies the concern is an eligible EDWOSB or WOSB or the concern is certified by a third-party certifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If SBA determines that the concern does not qualify as an EDWOSB or WOSB, then the D/GC will send the concern a written decision explaining the basis of ineligibility, and will require that the concern remove its EDWOSB or WOSB designation in SAM (or any successor system) within five (5) calendar days after the date of the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the concern has already certified itself as a WOSB or EDWOSB on a pending procurement the concern must immediately inform the officials responsible for the procurement of the adverse determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If SBA determines that the concern did not qualify as an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time it submitted its initial offer for an EDWOSB or WOSB requirement, the contracting officer may terminate the contract, not exercise any option, or not award further task or delivery orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether or not a contracting officer decides to allow or not allow an ineligible concern to fully perform a contract under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the contracting officer cannot count the award as one to an EDWOSB or WOSB and must update the Federal

Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and other databases from the date of award accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A concern that has been found to be ineligible may not represent itself as a WOSB or EDWOSB until it cures the reason for its ineligibility and SBA determines that the concern qualifies as a WOSB or EDWOSB. A concern that believes in good faith that it has cured the reason(s) for its ineligibility may request an examination under the procedures set forth in this section.
