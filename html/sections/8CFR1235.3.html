                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Detention prior to inspection. All persons arriving at a port- of-entry in the United States by vessel or aircraft shall be detained  aboard the vessel or at the airport of arrival by the owner, agent,  master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of  such vessel or aircraft until admitted or otherwise permitted to land by  an officer of the Service. Notice or order to detain shall not be  required. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in  charge, purser, or consignee of such vessel or aircraft shall deliver  every alien requiring examination to an immigration officer for  inspection or to a medical officer for examination. The Service will not  be liable for any expenses related to such detention or presentation or  for any expenses of a passenger who has not been presented for  inspection and for whom a determination has not been made concerning  admissibility by a Service officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expedited removal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability. The expedited removal  provisions shall apply to the following classes of aliens who are  determined to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or (7) of the  Act:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arriving aliens, as defined in Sec. 1001.1(q) of this chapter,  except for citizens of Cuba arriving at a United States port-of-entry by  aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As specifically designated by the Commissioner, aliens who  arrive in, attempt to enter, or have entered the United States without  having been admitted or paroled following inspection by an immigration  officer at a designated port-of-entry, and who have not established to  the satisfaction of the immigration officer that they have been  physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year  period immediately prior to the date of determination of  inadmissibility. The Commissioner shall have the sole discretion to  apply the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act, at any time, to  any class of aliens described in this section. The Commissioner's  designation shall become effective upon publication of a notice in the  Federal Register. However, if the Commissioner determines, in the  exercise of discretion, that the delay caused by publication would  adversely affect the interests of the United States or the effective  enforcement of the immigration laws, the Commissioner's designation  shall become effective immediately upon issuance, and shall be published  in the Federal Register as soon as practicable thereafter. When these  provisions are in effect for aliens who enter without inspection, the  burden of proof rests with the alien to affirmatively show that he or  she has the required continuous physical presence in the United States.  Any absence from the United States shall serve to break the period of  continuous physical presence. An alien who was not inspected and  admitted or paroled into the United States but who establishes that he  or she has been continuously physically present in the United States for  the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of determination of  inadmissibility shall be detained in accordance with section 235(b)(2)  of the Act for a proceeding under section 240 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of inadmissibility--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Record of proceeding. An  alien who is arriving in the United States, or other alien as designated  pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, who is determined to  be inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act  (except an alien for whom documentary requirements are waived under  Sec. 1211.1(b)(3) or Sec. 1212.1 of this chapter), shall be ordered  removed from the United States in accordance with section 235(b)(1) of  the Act. In every case in which the expedited removal provisions will be  applied and before removing an alien from the United States pursuant to  this section, the examining immigration officer shall create a record of  the facts of the case and statements made by the alien. This shall be  accomplished by means of a sworn statement using Form I-867AB, Record of  Sworn Statement in Proceedings under Section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The  examining immigration officer shall read (or have read) to the alien all  information contained on Form I-867A. Following questioning and  recording of the alien's statement regarding identity, alienage, and  inadmissibility, the examining immigration officer shall record the  alien's response to the questions contained on Form I-867B, and have the  alien read (or have read to him or her) the statement, and the alien  shall sign and initial each page of the statement and each correction.  The examining immigration officer shall advise the alien of the charges  against him or her on Form I-860, Notice and Order of Expedited Removal,  and the alien shall be given an opportunity to respond to those charges  in the sworn statement. After obtaining supervisory concurrence in  accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the examining  immigration official shall serve the alien with Form I-860 and the alien  shall sign the reverse of the form acknowledging receipt. Interpretative  assistance shall be used if necessary to communicate with the alien.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No entitlement to hearings and appeals. Except as otherwise  provided in this section, such alien is not entitled to a hearing before  an immigration judge in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 240 of  the Act, or to an   appeal of the expedited removal order to the Board of Immigration  Appeals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Detention and parole of alien in expedited removal. An alien  whose inadmissibility is being considered under this section or who has  been ordered removed pursuant to this section shall be detained pending  determination and removal, except that parole of such alien, in  accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when  the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that  parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a  legitimate law enforcement objective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional charges of inadmissibility. In the expedited removal  process, the Service may not charge an alien with any additional grounds  of inadmissibility other than section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the  Act. If an alien appears to be inadmissible under other grounds  contained in section 212(a) of the Act, and if the Service wishes to  pursue such additional grounds of inadmissibility, the alien shall be  detained and referred for a removal hearing before an immigration judge  pursuant to sections 235(b)(2) and 240 of the Act for inquiry into all  charges. Once the alien is in removal proceedings under section 240 of  the Act, the Service is not precluded from lodging additional charges  against the alien. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Service  from pursuing such additional grounds of inadmissibility against the  alien in any subsequent attempt to reenter the United States, provided  the additional grounds of inadmissibility still exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> provide for referring an alien to an  asylum officer if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum  or expresses a fear of persecution or torture or a fear of return to his  or her country.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral. The referring officer shall provide the alien with a  written disclosure on Form M-444, Information About Credible Fear  Interview, describing:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The purpose of the referral and description of the credible fear  interview process;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The right to consult with other persons prior to the interview  and any review thereof at no expense to the United States Government;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The right to request a review by an immigration judge of the  asylum officer's credible fear determination; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The consequences of failure to establish a credible fear of  persecution or torture.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detention pending credible fear interview. Pending the credible  fear determination by an asylum officer and any review of that  determination by an immigration judge, the alien shall be detained.  Parole of such alien in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act may  be permitted only when the Attorney General determines, in the exercise  of discretion, that parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is  necessary for a legitimate law enforcement objective. Prior to the  interview, the alien shall be given time to contact and consult with any  person or persons of his or her choosing. Such consultation shall be  made available in accordance with the policies and procedures of the  detention facility where the alien is detained, shall be at no expense  to the government, and shall not unreasonably delay the process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claim to lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status or  U.S. citizenship--(i) Verification of status. If an applicant for  admission who is subject to expedited removal pursuant to section  235(b)(1) of the Act claims to have been lawfully admitted for permanent  residence, admitted as a refugee under section 207 of the Act, granted  asylum under section 208 of the Act, or claims to be a U.S. citizen, the  immigration officer shall attempt to verify the alien's claim. Such  verification shall include a check of all available Service data systems  and any other means available to the officer. An alien whose claim to  lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee status, or U.S. citizen  status cannot be verified will be advised of the penalties for perjury,  and will be placed under oath or allowed to make a declaration as  permitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, concerning his or her lawful admission  for permanent residence, admission as a refugee under section 207 of the  Act, grant of asylum status under section 208 of the Act, or   claim to U.S. citizenship. A written statement shall be taken from the  alien in the alien's own language and handwriting, stating that he or  she declares, certifies, verifies, or states that the claim is true and  correct. The immigration officer shall issue an expedited order of  removal under section 235(b)(1)(A)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of the Act and refer the alien to  the immigration judge for review of the order in accordance with  paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section and Sec. 1235.6(a)(2)(ii). The  person shall be detained pending review of the expedited removal order  under this section. Parole of such person, in accordance with section  212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when the Attorney General  determines, in the exercise of discretion, that parole is required to  meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a legitimate law  enforcement objective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Verified lawful permanent residents. If the claim to lawful  permanent resident status is verified, and such status has not been  terminated in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, the  examining immigration officer shall not order the alien removed pursuant  to section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The examining immigration officer will  determine in accordance with section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Act whether  the alien is considered to be making an application for admission. If  the alien is determined to be seeking admission and the alien is  otherwise admissible, except that he or she is not in possession of the  required documentation, a discretionary waiver of documentary  requirements may be considered in accordance with section 211(b) of the  Act and Sec. 1211.1(b)(3) of this chapter or the alien's inspection may  be deferred to an onward office for presentation of the required  documents. If the alien appears to be inadmissible, the immigration  officer may initiate removal proceedings against the alien under section  240 of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Verified refugees and asylees. If a check of Service records  or other means indicates that the alien has been granted refugee status  or asylee status, and such status has not been terminated in  deportation, exclusion, or removal proceedings, the immigration officer  shall not order the alien removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the  Act. If the alien is not in possession of a valid, unexpired refugee  travel document, the examining immigration officer may accept an  application for a refugee travel document in accordance with Sec.  223.2(b)(2)(ii) of 8 CFR chapter I. If accepted, the immigration officer  shall readmit the refugee or asylee in accordance with Sec.  223.3(d)(2)(i) of 8 CFR chapter I. If the alien is determined not to be  eligible to file an application for a refugee travel document the  immigration officer may initiate removal proceedings against the alien  under section 240 of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Review of order for claimed lawful permanent residents,  refugees, asylees, or U.S. citizens. A person whose claim to U.S.  citizenship has been verified may not be ordered removed. When an alien  whose status has not been verified but who is claiming under oath or  under penalty of perjury to be a lawful permanent resident, refugee,  asylee, or U.S. citizen is ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1)  of the Act, the case will be referred to an immigration judge for review  of the expedited removal order under section 235(b)(1)(C) of the Act and  Sec. 1235.6(a)(2)(ii). If the immigration judge determines that the  alien has never been admitted as a lawful permanent resident or as a  refugee, granted asylum status, or is not a U.S. citizen, the order  issued by the immigration officer will be affirmed and the Service will  remove the alien. There is no appeal from the decision of the  immigration judge. If the immigration judge determines that the alien  was once so admitted as a lawful permanent resident or as a refugee, or  was granted asylum status, or is a U.S. citizen, and such status has not  been terminated by final administrative action, the immigration judge  will terminate proceedings and vacate the expedited removal order. The  Service may initiate removal proceedings against such an alien, but not  against a person determined to be a U.S. citizen, in proceedings under  section 240 of the Act. During removal proceedings, the immigration  judge may consider any waivers, exceptions, or requests for relief for  which the alien is eligible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Opportunity for alien to establish that he or she was admitted  or paroled   into the United States. If the Commissioner determines that the  expedited removal provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act shall apply  to any or all aliens described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section,  such alien will be given a reasonable opportunity to establish to the  satisfaction of the examining immigration officer that he or she was  admitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a  port-of-entry. The alien will be allowed to present evidence or provide  sufficient information to support the claim. Such evidence may consist  of documentation in the possession of the alien, the Service, or a third  party. The examining immigration officer will consider all such evidence  and information, make further inquiry if necessary, and will attempt to  verify the alien's status through a check of all available Service data  systems. The burden rests with the alien to satisfy the examining  immigration officer of the claim of lawful admission or parole. If the  alien establishes that he or she was lawfully admitted or paroled, the  case will be examined to determine if grounds of deportability under  section 237(a) of the Act are applicable, or if paroled, whether such  parole has been, or should be, terminated, and whether the alien is  inadmissible under section 212(a) of the Act. An alien who cannot  satisfy the examining officer that he or she was lawfully admitted or  paroled will be ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Review of expedited removal orders. Any removal order entered by  an examining immigration officer pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the  Act must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate supervisor before  the order is considered final. Such supervisory review shall not be  delegated below the level of the second line supervisor, or a person  acting in that capacity. The supervisory review shall include a review  of the sworn statement and any answers and statements made by the alien  regarding a fear of removal or return. The supervisory review and  approval of an expedited removal order for an alien described in section  235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act must include a review of any claim of  lawful admission or parole and any evidence or information presented to  support such a claim, prior to approval of the order. In such cases, the  supervisor may request additional information from any source and may  require further interview of the alien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Removal procedures relating to expedited removal. An alien  ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the Act shall be  removed from the United States in accordance with section 241(c) of the  Act and 8 CFR part 1241.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Waivers of documentary requirements. Nothing in this section  limits the discretionary authority of the Attorney General, including  authority under sections 211(b) or 212(d) of the Act, to waive the  documentary requirements for arriving aliens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Applicant for admission under section 217 of the Act. The  provisions of Sec. 1235.3(b) do not apply to an applicant for admission  under section 217 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Arriving aliens placed in proceedings under section 240 of the  Act. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any arriving alien  who appears to the inspecting officer to be inadmissible, and who is  placed in removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act shall  be detained in accordance with section 235(b) of the Act. Parole of such  alien shall only be considered in accordance with Sec. 1212.5(b) of  this chapter. This paragraph shall also apply to any alien who arrived  before April 1, 1997, and who was placed in exclusion proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service custody. The Service will assume custody of any alien  subject to detention under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. In its  discretion, the Service may require any alien who appears inadmissible  and who arrives at a land border port-of-entry from Canada or Mexico, to  remain in that country while awaiting a removal hearing. Such alien  shall be considered detained for a proceeding within the meaning of  section 235(b) of the Act and may be ordered removed in absentia by an  immigration judge if the alien fails to appear for the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Detention in non-Service facility. Whenever an alien is taken  into Service custody and detained at a facility   other than at a Service Processing Center, the public or private  entities contracted to perform such service shall have been approved for  such use by the Service's Jail Inspection Program or shall be performing  such service under contract in compliance with the Standard Statement of  Work for Contract Detention Facilities. Both programs are administered  by the Detention and Deportation section having jurisdiction over the  alien's place of detention. Under no circumstances shall an alien be  detained in facilities not meeting the four mandatory criteria for  usage. These are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 24-Hour supervision,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conformance with safety and emergency codes,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Food service, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Availability of emergency medical care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Privilege of communication. The mandatory notification  requirements of consular and diplomatic officers pursuant to Sec.  1236.1(e) of this chapter apply when an inadmissible alien is detained  for removal proceedings, including for purpose of conducting the  credible fear determination.
