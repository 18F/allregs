                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As stated in Sec. 779.338, the special exceptions provided in the 1961 amendments for hotels, motels, restaurants, hospitals, institutions for the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or defective, and schools for physically or mentally handicapped or gifted children have been removed. Seasonally operated amusement or recreational establishments and motion picture theaters also no longer are specifically exempt under section 13(a)(2), but have specific exemptions set out for them in sections 13(a)(3) and 13(a)(9) of the Act as amended in 1966.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hotels, motels, and restaurants continue to be eligible for exemption under section 13(a)(2), but must meet all the requirements of that section for exemption in the same manner as other retail or service establishments. However, a special overtime exemption is provided for such establishments, regardless of size, in the first part of section 13(b)(8). Hospitals, residential care establishments, and schools for physically or mentally handicapped or gifted children are specifically excluded by the Act from consideration for exemption under section 13(a)(2); however, residential care establishments are exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Act under the second part of section 13(b)(8) as long as overtime premium of not less than one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay is paid to him for time worked in excess of 48 hours in the workweek. In addition, section 7(j) of the amended Act provides a special overtime arrangement for hospital employees whereby overtime pay is due an employee after 8 hours in a day or 80 hours in a 14-day work period rather than on the basis of the 7-day workweek as is normally required by the Act. This provision, though, requires an agreement or understanding on the part of both the employer and the employee prior to the performance of the work. See Sec. 778.601 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amendments of 1966 also repealed the exemption from both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions which was in the Act for certain food service employees employed by retail or service establishments that were not exempt under section 13(a)(2). This exemption (formerly found in section 13(a)(20) is now an exemption from the overtime provisions only and is set out in section 13(b)(18). Those establishments now excluded by the Act from consideration for exemption under section 13(a)(2) (hospitals, residential care establishments, etc.) may utilize this exemption where they meet the Act's definition of retail or service establishment in the last sentence of section 13(a)(2) and the conditions set out in section 13(b)(18). Likewise, the special exemption for any employee of a retail or service establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling automobiles, trucks, or farm implements was repealed by the 1966 amendments. In its stead the overtime exemption set out in section 13(b)(10) and previously discussed in Sec. 779.372 was provided for certain employees of any

nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements, or aircraft to the ultimate consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A special exemption from the overtime pay requirements is also included in the amended Act for bowling establishments which do not meet the tests under section 13(a)(2) for exemption as a retail or service establishment. Section 13(b)(19) states that the overtime pay requirements of the Act shall not apply with respect to ``any employee of a bowling establishment if such employee receives compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.'' Unlike the overtime pay exemption in section 13(b)(18), this exemption is not dependent upon the establishment meeting the definition of retail or service establishment.</p><p class="depth2">Hotels and Motels</p>
