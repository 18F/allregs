                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(9)</em> of the Act as amended  in 1966.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(8)</em> as long as overtime premium of not less than one and one-half  times the employee's regular rate of pay is paid to him for time worked  in excess of 48 hours in the workweek. In addition, section 7(j) of the  amended Act provides a special overtime arrangement for hospital  employees whereby overtime pay is due an employee after 8 hours in a day  or 80 hours in a 14-day work period rather than on the basis of the 7- day workweek as is normally required by the Act. This provision, though,  requires an agreement or understanding on the part of both the employer  and the employee prior to the performance of the work. See Sec. 778.601  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amendments of 1966 also repealed the exemption from both the  minimum wage and overtime pay provisions which was in the Act for  certain food service employees employed by retail or service  establishments that were not exempt under section 13(a)(2). This  exemption (formerly found in section 13(a)(20) is now an exemption from  the overtime provisions only and is set out in section 13(b)(18). Those  establishments now excluded by the Act from consideration for exemption  under section 13(a)(2) (hospitals, residential care establishments,  etc.) may utilize this exemption where they meet the Act's definition of  retail or service establishment in the last sentence of section 13(a)(2)  and the conditions set out in section 13(b)(18). Likewise, the special  exemption for any employee of a retail or service establishment  primarily engaged in the business of selling automobiles, trucks, or  farm implements was repealed by the 1966 amendments. In its stead the  overtime exemption set out in section 13(b)(10) and previously discussed  in Sec. 779.372 was provided for certain employees of any   nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of  selling automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements, or aircraft to  the ultimate consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A special exemption from the overtime pay requirements is also  included in the amended Act for bowling establishments which do not meet  the tests under section 13(a)(2) for exemption as a retail or service  establishment. Section 13(b)(19) states that the overtime pay  requirements of the Act shall not apply with respect to ``any employee  of a bowling establishment if such employee receives compensation for  employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not less than  one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.''  Unlike the overtime pay exemption in section 13(b)(18), this exemption  is not dependent upon the establishment meeting the definition of retail  or service establishment.</p><p class="depth2">Hotels and Motels</p>
