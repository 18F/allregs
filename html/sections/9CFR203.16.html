In cases when the seller does not intend to  be present, he may use the following form of notification to the  purchaser:</p><p class="depth2">I do not intend to be present at the point of transfer of possession  of livestock sold by me to (name of packer, market agency, or dealer)  for the purpose of receiving a check in payment for such livestock.</p><p class="depth2">I hereby direct (name of packer, market agency, or dealer) to make  payment for livestock purchased from me, by mailing a check for the full  amount of the purchase price before the close of the next business day  following the purchase of livestock and transfer of possession thereof  or, in the case of a purchase on a ``carcass'' or ``grade and   yield'' basis, not later than the close of the first business day  following determination of the purchase price.</p><p class="depth2">This does not constitute an extension of credit to (name of packer,  market agency or dealer). This is subject to cancellation by me at any  time, and if not cancelled by (date), it shall terminate on that date.   If the seller, for reasons other than not being present to receive  payment, prefers to have the packer, market agency, or dealer make  payment by mailing a check within the time limit as provided in section  409(a), he may use the above form but should not include the statement  in the first sentence that he does not intend to be present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration  (Packers and Stockyards Programs) believes that such an agreement would  not constitute an extension of credit within the meaning of section 206  of the Act because it would not give the purchaser any more time to  issue a check than is provided in section 409(a).
