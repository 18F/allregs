                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) is a policy covering all  individuals named by a State as recipients under section 408 of the  Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174) of an Individuals and Households Program  (IHP) award for   flood damage as a result of major disaster declaration by the President.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The premium for the GFIP is a flat fee of $600 per insured. We  may adjust the premium to reflect NFIP loss experience and any  adjustment of benefits under the IHP program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of coverage is equivalent to the maximum grant amount  established under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term of the GFIP is for 36 months and begins 60 days after  the date of the disaster declaration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coverage for individual grantees begins on the thirtieth day  after the NFIP receives the required data for individual grantees and  their premium payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> We will send a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each individual  insured under the GFIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The GFIP is the Standard Flood Insurance Policy Dwelling Form (a  copy of which is included in Appendix A(1) of this part), except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> VI. DEDUCTIBLES does not apply to the GFIP. A special deductible  of $200 (applicable separately to any building loss and any contents  loss) applies to insured flood-damage losses sustained by the insured  property in the course of any subsequent flooding event during the term  of the GFIP. The deductible does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> III. C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> VII. GENERAL CONDITIONS, E. Cancellation of Policy by You, does  not apply to the GFIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> VII. GENERAL CONDITIONS, H. Policy Renewal, does not apply to  the GFIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> We will send a notice to the GFIP certificate holders  approximately 60 days before the end of the thirty-six month term of the  GFIP. The notice will encourage them to contact a local insurance agent  or producer or a private insurance company selling NFIP policies under  the Write Your Own program of the NFIP Standard Flood Insurance Policy,  and advise them as to the amount of coverage they must maintain in order  not to jeopardize their eligibility for future disaster assistance. The  IHP program will provide the NFIP the amount of flood insurance coverage  to be maintained by certificate holders.

Food freezers, other than walk-in, and food in any freezer.</p><p class="depth0">4. If you are a tenant and have insured personal property under  Coverage B in this policy, we will cover such property, including your  cooking stove or range and refrigerator. The policy will also cover  improvements made or acquired solely at your expense in the dwelling or  apartment in which you reside, but for not more than 10% of the limit of  liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of  this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit  of liability.</p><p class="depth0">5.

General.</p><p class="depth0">This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain  management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a  structure suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for  payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any  combination of these activities) of your structure. Eligible  floodproofing activities are limited to:</p><p class="depth0">a. Non-residential structures.</p><p class="depth0">b. Residential structures with basements that satisfy FEMA's  standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b)  or (c)].</p><p class="depth0">2. Limit of Liability.</p><p class="depth0">We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D--Increased Cost  of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage  (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to  the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which  appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under  this policy for both Coverage A--Building Property and Coverage D-- Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under  the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under  Coverage D.</p><p class="depth0">3. Eligibility</p><p class="depth0">a. A structure covered under Coverage A--Building Property  sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be a ``repetitive loss structure.'' A repetitive loss structure  is one that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The structure is covered by a contract of flood insurance issued  under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The structure has suffered flood damage on two occasions during  a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or  exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each  flood loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the  previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a  cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in  its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the  structure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be a structure that has had flood damage in which the cost to  repair equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the  time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage  provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced  against the structure.</p><p class="depth0">b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain  management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the  National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal  Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed  those standards under these conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or  advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local  government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in  such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones  which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also  includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are  being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the  higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance  coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the  community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or  floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations  derived solely by the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to  meet State or local ``freeboard'' requirements, i.e., that a structure  must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and  communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in  unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is  obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance  activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</p><p class="depth0">d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after  demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure  during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local  floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g.  below.</p><p class="depth0">e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure  into compliance with state or local floodplain management laws or  ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the  present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</p><p class="depth0">4. Conditions.</p><p class="depth0">a. When a structure covered under Coverage A--Building Property  sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this  Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof,  relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by  the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management  ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible   demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the  site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the  enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances  or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will  include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and  ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.</p><p class="depth0">b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for  the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by  current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</p><p class="depth0">5. Exclusions.</p><p class="depth0">Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) we will not pay  for:</p><p class="depth0">a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or  ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.</p><p class="depth0">b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that  requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove,  contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or  assess the effects of pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">c. The loss in value to any insured building or other structure due  to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</p><p class="depth0">d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building  demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local  floodplain management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated on the same or to another premises; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed  two years.</p><p class="depth0">f. Any code upgrade requirements, e.g., plumbing or electrical  wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain  management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or  improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or  local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</p><p class="depth0">h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply  with before the current loss.</p><p class="depth0">i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's  minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has  received from the State or community a variance in connection with the  current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the  base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</p><p class="depth0">k. Any structure insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth0">l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual  condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly  owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local  floodplain management ordinances or laws.</p><p class="depth0">6. Other Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the  calculation to determine whether coverage meets the 80% insurance-to- value requirement for replacement cost coverage as set forth in VII.  General Conditions, V. Loss Settlement.</p><p class="depth0">b. All other conditions and provisions of the policy apply.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Property Not Covered</p><p class="depth0">We do not cover any of the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. Personal property not inside a building;</p><p class="depth0">2.

Personal property you own in common with other unit owners  comprising the membership of a condominium association.</p><p class="depth0">V. Exclusions</p><p class="depth0">A. We only pay for direct physical loss by or from flood, which  means that we do not pay you for:</p><p class="depth0">1. Loss of revenue or profits;</p><p class="depth0">2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;</p><p class="depth0">3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</p><p class="depth0">4.

This  exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in  Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance; or</p><p class="depth0">7. Any other economic loss you suffer.</p><p class="depth0">B. We do not insure a loss directly or indirectly caused by a flood  that is already in progress at the time and date:</p><p class="depth0">1. The policy term begins; or</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage is added at your request.</p><p class="depth0">C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth  movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of  earth movement that we do not cover are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0">2. Landslide;</p><p class="depth0">3. Land subsidence;</p><p class="depth0">4. Sinkholes;</p><p class="depth0">5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from  accumulation of water in subsurface land area; or</p><p class="depth0">6.

We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property  located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or  incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where  the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood  insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</p><p class="depth0">F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants  unless required by law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Deductibles</p><p class="depth0">A. When a loss is covered under this policy, we will pay only that  part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the  limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the  Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair  does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof  at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the  deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</p><p class="depth0">B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the  building and personal property insured by this policy.</p><p class="depth0">C. The deductible does NOT apply to:</p><p class="depth0">1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures;</p><p class="depth0">2. III.C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments; or</p><p class="depth0">3. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0">VII. General Conditions</p><p class="depth0">A. Pair and Set Clause</p><p class="depth0">In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will  have the option of paying you:</p><p class="depth0">1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or  destroyed article, minus its depreciation, or</p><p class="depth0">2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value  of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to  the pair or set.</p><p class="depth0">B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance</p><p class="depth0">1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy:</p><p class="depth0">a. Is void;</p><p class="depth0">b. Has no legal force or effect;</p><p class="depth0">c. Cannot be renewed; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Cannot be replaced by a new NFIP policy, if, before or after a  loss, you or any other insured or your agent have at any time:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or  circumstance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Made false statements; relating to this policy or any other NFIP  insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. This policy will be void as of the date wrongful acts described  in B.1.above were committed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal  laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</p><p class="depth0">4. This policy is also void for reasons other than fraud,  misrepresentation, or wrongful act. This policy is void from its  inception and has no legal force under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the property is located in a community that was not  participating in the NFIP on the policy's inception date and did not  join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss  occurred; or</p><p class="depth0">b. If the property listed on the application is otherwise not  eligible for coverage under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">C. Other Insurance</p><p class="depth0">1. If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other  insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will  not pay more than the amount of insurance you are entitled to for lost,  damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the  following:</p><p class="depth0">a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of  insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of  insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. immediately below  applies.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess  insurance, this policy will be primary.</p><p class="depth0">c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible)  up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as  described in C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached,  this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of  insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies,  for the remainder of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">2. If there is other insurance in the name of your condominium  association covering the same property covered by this policy, then this  policy will be in excess over the other insurance.</p><p class="depth0">D. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</p><p class="depth0">This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be  waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance  Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy  constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in  writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except  under these conditions:</p><p class="depth0">1. When this policy covers only personal property; or</p><p class="depth0">2. When this policy covers a structure during the course of  construction.</p><p class="depth0">E. Cancellation of the Policy by You</p><p class="depth0">1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the applicable  rules and regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or  partial refund of premium also under the applicable rules and  regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">F. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</p><p class="depth0">Your policy will not be renewed:</p><p class="depth0">1. If the community where your covered property is located stops  participating in the NFIP, or</p><p class="depth0">2. If your building has been declared ineligible under section 1316  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">G. Reduction and Reformation of Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. If the premium we received from you was not enough to buy the  kind and amount of coverage you requested, we will provide only the  amount of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we  received.</p><p class="depth0">2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount of coverage  resulting from the reduction described in G.1. above to the amount you  requested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information Before a Loss:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion  of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount  of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional  premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the  policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested  amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or  subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term,  we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional  information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be  increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information After a Loss:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms.  If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30  days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the  amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the  beginning of the prior policy term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior  policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is  due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced  amount of coverage. The amount of coverage can only be increased by  endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not  tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did  anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of  Condition B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance apply.</p><p class="depth0">H. Policy Renewal</p><p class="depth0">1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the  policy term.</p><p class="depth0">2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium  within 30 days of the expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice  into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,  e.g., we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which  delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium,  then we will follow these procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after  the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non- receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium,  and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph  apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which  will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</p><p class="depth0">b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by  the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case,  the policy will remain an expired policy as of the expiration date shown  on the Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you  during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire  we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most  recent application for or renewal of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">I. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance</p><p class="depth0">We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that  is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</p><p class="depth0">J. Requirements in Case of Loss</p><p class="depth0">In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</p><p class="depth0">1. Give prompt written notice to us;</p><p class="depth0">2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and  undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may  examine it;</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity,  description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills,  receipts, and related documents;</p><p class="depth0">4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is  your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed  and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following  information:</p><p class="depth0">a. The date and time of loss;</p><p class="depth0">b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</p><p class="depth0">c. Your interest (for example, ``owner'') and the interest, if any,  of others in the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</p><p class="depth0">e. Changes in title or occupancy of the covered property during the  term of the policy;</p><p class="depth0">f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair  estimates;</p><p class="depth0">g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or  claim against the insured property;</p><p class="depth0">h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of  loss and for what purpose; and</p><p class="depth0">i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in J.3.  above.</p><p class="depth0">5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment  concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</p><p class="depth0">6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the  investigation of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may  furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you  complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must  still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the  adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</p><p class="depth0">8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove  claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</p><p class="depth0">9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss  instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include  information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign  the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the  report.</p><p class="depth0">K. Our Options After a Loss</p><p class="depth0">Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include  the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you  must:</p><p class="depth0">a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of  another insured, and sign the same; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and  the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Condominium association documents including the Declarations of  the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws,  rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit  owner in a condominium building; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or  certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are  lost.</p><p class="depth0">2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete  inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:</p><p class="depth0">a. Quantities and costs;</p><p class="depth0">b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is  appropriate);</p><p class="depth0">c. Amounts of loss claimed;</p><p class="depth0">d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged  property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive  your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or  destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or  its functional equivalent; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we  agree upon or its appraised value.</p><p class="depth0">L. No Benefit to Bailee</p><p class="depth0">No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered  property will benefit from this insurance.</p><p class="depth0">M. Loss Payment</p><p class="depth0">1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some  other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to  receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your  proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the  adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss)  and:</p><p class="depth0">a. We reach an agreement with you;</p><p class="depth0">b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</p><p class="depth0">c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in  VII. P.</p><p class="depth0">2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Accept our denial of your claim;</p><p class="depth0">b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</p><p class="depth0">c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60  days of the date of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">N. Abandonment</p><p class="depth0">You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured  under this policy.</p><p class="depth0">O. Salvage</p><p class="depth0">We may permit you to keep damaged property insured under this policy  after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable  to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.</p><p class="depth0">P. Appraisal</p><p class="depth0">If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if  applicable, replacement cost of your damaged property to settle upon the  amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this  event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser  within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two  appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire  within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge  of a court of record in the state where the covered property is located.  The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the  replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers  submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon  will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit  their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will  set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the  replacement cost and loss.</p><p class="depth0">Each party will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Pay its own appraiser; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</p><p class="depth0">Q. Mortgage Clause</p><p class="depth0">The word ``mortgagee'' includes trustee.</p><p class="depth0">Any loss payable under Coverage A--Building Property will be paid to  any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other  mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and  you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order  of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim  of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</p><p class="depth0">1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or  substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</p><p class="depth0">2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have  neglected to pay the premium; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after  receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</p><p class="depth0">All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth0">The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the  mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</p><p class="depth0">If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in  effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify  the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</p><p class="depth0">If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are  subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage  on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee  to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</p><p class="depth0">R. Suit Against Us</p><p class="depth0">You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you  have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue,  you must start the suit within one year after the date of the written  denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the  United States District Court of the district in which the covered  property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to  any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that  you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</p><p class="depth0">S. Subrogation</p><p class="depth0">Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are  subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person.  That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or  totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to  the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to  acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give  up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us  from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused  your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you  may keep any of that money.</p><p class="depth0">T. Continuous Lake Flooding</p><p class="depth0">1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters  continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that  a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the  insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits  plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one  building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without  waiting for the   further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</p><p class="depth0">a. To make no further claim under this policy;</p><p class="depth0">b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</p><p class="depth0">c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property  at the described location; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</p><p class="depth0">If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded  continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will  apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy  term ends.</p><p class="depth0">2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding  from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either  paragraph T.1. above or T.2. (A ``closed basin lake'' is a natural lake  from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface  area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the  recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the  western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds  annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject  to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These  lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph  T.2., we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even  though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to  the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage  your building.</p><p class="depth0">b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the  salvage on a negotiated basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's ``Policy  Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes'' to be recorded in the office of the  local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in  which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas  of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood  damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the  agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that  portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural  and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on  any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple  agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable  structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under  the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph  T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project  or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the  property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas  protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then  no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.</p><p class="depth0">c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your  building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an  additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to  extend the time.</p><p class="depth0">d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an  elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local  floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</p><p class="depth0">e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having  jurisdiction over your building must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium  for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a  permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions  specified in the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to  FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of  1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible  with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected  property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions  must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above, except  that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use  restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance  Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property  as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed- restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</p><p class="depth0">f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take  all action set forth in FEMA's ``Policy Guidance for Closed Basin  Lakes.''</p><p class="depth0">g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in  effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under  paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into  effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in  coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this  continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim  under this paragraph T.2, we will not consider to be in effect any  increased coverage that became effective after the date established by  FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount  suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the  FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the  community, in writing, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance  with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</p><p class="depth0">U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed</p><p class="depth0">1. We will not insure your property under more than one NFIP policy.</p><p class="depth0">If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will  give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose  one of several options under the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased  coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will  the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage  under the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will  make a refund to you, according to applicable NFIP rules, of the premium  for the policy not being kept in effect.</p><p class="depth0">2. Your option under Condition U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed to  elect which NFIP policy to keep in effect does not apply when duplicates  have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such circumstances  will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of the earlier  policy. The policy with the later effective date must be canceled.</p><p class="depth0">V. Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement  Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is  used for a different type of property, as explained in a-c. below.</p><p class="depth0">a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in V.2. below,  applies to a single-family dwelling provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is your principal residence, which means that, at the time of  loss, you or your spouse lived there for 80% of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The 365 days immediately preceding the loss; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The period of your ownership, if you owned the dwelling for less  than 365 days; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy that  applies to the dwelling is 80% or more of its full replacement cost  immediately before the loss, or is the maximum amount of insurance  available under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">b. Special Loss Settlement, described in V.3. below, applies to a  single-family dwelling that is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel  trailer.</p><p class="depth0">c. Actual Cash Value loss settlement applies to a single-family  dwelling not subject to replacement cost or special loss settlement, and  to the property listed in V.4. below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family  dwelling described in V.1.a. above:</p><p class="depth0">a. We will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after  application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation,  but not more than the least of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged, with  materials of like kind and quality and for like use; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the  damaged part of the dwelling for like use.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the dwelling is rebuilt at a new location, the cost described  above is limited to the cost that would have been incurred if the  dwelling had been rebuilt at its former location.</p><p class="depth0">c. When the full cost of repair or replacement is more than $1,000,  or more than 5% of the whole amount of insurance that applies to the  dwelling, we will not be liable for any loss under V.2.a. above or  V.4.a.(2) below unless and until actual repair or replacement is  completed.</p><p class="depth0">d. You may disregard the replacement cost conditions above and make  claim under this policy for loss to dwellings on an actual cash value  basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to  V.2.a., b., and c. above, provided you notify us of your intent to do so  within 180 days after the date of loss.</p><p class="depth0">e. If the community in which your dwelling is located has been  converted from the Emergency Program to the Regular Program during the  current policy term, then we will consider the maximum amount of  available NFIP insurance to be the amount that was available at the  beginning of the current policy term.</p><p class="depth0">3. Special Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family  dwelling that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer, as defined  in II.B.6.b. and c.,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has an area of  at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully  assembled, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> is your principal residence as specified in V.1.a.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0">b. If such a dwelling is totally destroyed or damaged to such an  extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair,  at least to its pre-damage condition, we will, at our discretion pay the  least of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The lesser of the replacement cost of the dwelling or 1.5 times  the actual cash value, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">c. If such a dwelling is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it  is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damage condition, we  will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost conditions in  V.2.above.</p><p class="depth0">4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value  (or in the case of V.4.a.(2), below, proportional) loss settlement.</p><p class="depth0">a. A dwelling, at the time of loss, when the amount of insurance on  the dwelling is both less than 80% of its full replacement cost  immediately before the loss and less than the maximum amount of  insurance available under the NFIP. In that case, we will pay the  greater of the following amounts, but not more than the amount of  insurance that applies to that dwelling:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The actual cash value, as defined in II.B.2., of the damaged  part of the dwelling; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A proportion of the cost to repair or replace the damaged part  of the dwelling, without deduction for physical depreciation and after  application of the deductible.</p><p class="depth0">This proportion is determined as follows: If 80% of the full  replacement cost of the dwelling is less than the maximum amount of  insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by  dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the amount of  insurance that represents 80% of its full replacement cost. But if 80%  of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is greater than the maximum  amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is  determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by  the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">b. A two-, three-, or four-family dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">c. A unit that is not used exclusively for single-family dwelling  purposes.</p><p class="depth0">d. Detached garages.</p><p class="depth0">e. Personal property.</p><p class="depth0">f. Appliances, carpets, and carpet pads.</p><p class="depth0">g. Outdoor awnings, outdoor antennas or aerials of any type, and  other outdoor equipment.</p><p class="depth0">h. Any property covered under this policy that is abandoned after a  loss and remains as debris anywhere on the described location.</p><p class="depth0">i. A dwelling that is not your principal residence.</p><p class="depth0">5. Amount of Insurance Required</p><p class="depth0">To determine the amount of insurance required for a dwelling  immediately before the loss, we do not include the value of:</p><p class="depth0">a. Footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices  that are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor and support  all or part of the dwelling;</p><p class="depth0">b. Those supports listed in V.5.a. above, that are below the surface  of the ground inside the foundation walls if there is no basement; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Excavations and underground flues, pipes, wiring, and drains.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance limit of  liability is not included in the determination of the amount of  insurance required.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Liberalization Clause</p><p class="depth0">If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition  of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that  change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we  implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls  within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the  Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">IX. What Law Governs</p><p class="depth0">This policy and all disputes arising from the handling of any claim  under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance  regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as  amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and Federal common law.</p><p class="depth0">In Witness Whereof, we have signed this policy below and hereby  enter into this Insurance Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator, Federal Insurance Administration.

Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance</p><p class="depth0">1. General.</p><p class="depth0">This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain  management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a  structure suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for  payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any  combination of these activities) of your structure. Eligible  floodproofing activities are limited to:</p><p class="depth0">a. Non-residential structures. b. Residential structures with  basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal  Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].</p><p class="depth0">2. Limit of Liability.</p><p class="depth0">We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D--Increased Cost  of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage  (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to  the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which  appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under  this policy for both Coverage A (Building Property) and Coverage D  (Increased Cost of Compliance) cannot exceed the maximum permitted under  the Act. We do NOT charge a separate deductible for a claim under  Coverage D.</p><p class="depth0">3. Eligibility.</p><p class="depth0">a. A structure covered under Coverage A--Building Property  sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be a ``repetitive loss structure.'' A ``repetitive loss  structure'' is one that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The structure is covered by a contract of flood insurance issued  under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The structure has suffered flood damage on 2 occasions during a  10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or  exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each  flood loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the  previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a  cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in  its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the  structure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be a structure that has had flood damage in which the cost to  repair equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the  time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage  provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced  against the structure.</p><p class="depth0">b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain  management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the  National Flood Insurance   Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay  for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or  advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local  government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged structures in  such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones  which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also  includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are  being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the  higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance  coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the  community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or  floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations  derived solely by the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to  meet State or local ``freeboard'' requirements, i.e., that a structure  must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and  communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in  unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is  obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance  activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</p><p class="depth0">d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after  demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure  during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local  floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g.  below.</p><p class="depth0">e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure  into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or  ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the  present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</p><p class="depth0">4. Conditions.</p><p class="depth0">a. When a structure covered under Coverage A--Building Property  sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this  Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof,  relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by  the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management  ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will  be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or  a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local  floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the  cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue  utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site  utilities.</p><p class="depth0">b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for  the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by  current floodplain management ordinances or laws.</p><p class="depth0">5. Exclusions.</p><p class="depth0">Under this Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance, we will not pay  for:</p><p class="depth0">a.

The loss in value to any insured building or other structure due  to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</p><p class="depth0">d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building  demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local  floodplain management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated on the same or to another premises; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed  two years.</p><p class="depth0">f. Any code upgrade requirements, e.g., plumbing or electrical  wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain  management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or  improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or  local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</p><p class="depth0">h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply  with before the current loss.</p><p class="depth0">i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's  minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has  received from the State or community a variance in connection with the  current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the  base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">j.

Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</p><p class="depth0">4. Loss from interruption of business or production;</p><p class="depth0">5. Any additional expenses incurred while the insured building is  being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;</p><p class="depth0">6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or  regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation or  repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This  exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities that we describe in  Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance; or</p><p class="depth0">7. Any other economic loss you suffer.</p><p class="depth0">B. We do not insure a loss directly or indirectly caused by a flood  that is already in progress at the time and date:</p><p class="depth0">1. The policy term begins; or</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage is added at your request.</p><p class="depth0">C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth  movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of  earth movement that we do not cover are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0">2. Landslide;</p><p class="depth0">3. Land subsidence;</p><p class="depth0">4. Sinkholes;</p><p class="depth0">5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from  accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or</p><p class="depth0">6. Gradual erosion.</p><p class="depth0">We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a  result of erosion that are specifically covered under our definition of  flood (see A.1.c. and II.A.2.).</p><p class="depth0">D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or  indirectly by:</p><p class="depth0">1. The pressure or weight of ice;</p><p class="depth0">2. Freezing or thawing;</p><p class="depth0">3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;</p><p class="depth0">4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily  from any condition:</p><p class="depth0">a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or</p><p class="depth0">b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Design, structural, or mechanical defects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines,  drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood  recedes;</p><p class="depth0">5. Water or water-borne material that:</p><p class="depth0">a. Backs up through sewers or drains;</p><p class="depth0">b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related  equipment; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Seeps or leaks on or through the covered property; unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause  of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the  seepage of water;</p><p class="depth0">6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the  area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the  pressure or weight of water;</p><p class="depth0">7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results  from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling  equipment situated on the described location;</p><p class="depth0">8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;</p><p class="depth0">9. Anything that you or your agents do or conspire to do to cause  loss by flood deliberately; or</p><p class="depth0">10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases  the risk of flooding.</p><p class="depth0">E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property  located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or  incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where  the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood  insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Deductibles</p><p class="depth0">A. When a loss is covered under this policy, we will pay only that  part of the loss that exceeds the applicable deductible amount, subject  to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown  on the Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair  does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof  at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the  deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</p><p class="depth0">B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the  building and personal property insured by this policy.</p><p class="depth0">C. No deductible applies to:</p><p class="depth0">1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or</p><p class="depth0">2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0">VII. General Conditions</p><p class="depth0">A. Pair and Set Clause</p><p class="depth0">In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will  have the option of paying you:</p><p class="depth0">1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or  destroyed article, less depreciation, or</p><p class="depth0">2. An amount which represents the fair proportion of the total value  of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to  the pair or set.</p><p class="depth0">B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance</p><p class="depth0">1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy:</p><p class="depth0">a. Is void,</p><p class="depth0">b. Has no legal force or effect,</p><p class="depth0">c. Cannot be renewed, and</p><p class="depth0">d. Cannot be replaced by a new NFIP policy, if, before or after a  loss, you or any other insured or your agent have at any time:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or  circumstance,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engaged in fraudulent conduct, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Made false statements relating to this policy or any other NFIP  insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. This policy will be void as of the date wrongful acts described  in B.1. above were committed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal  laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</p><p class="depth0">4. This policy is also void for reasons other than fraud,  misrepresentation, or wrongful act. This policy is void from its  inception and has no legal force under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the property is located in a community that was not  participating in the NFIP on the policy's inception date and did not  join or re-enter the program during the policy term and before the loss  occurred; or</p><p class="depth0">b. If the property listed on the application is otherwise not  eligible for coverage under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">C. Other Insurance</p><p class="depth0">1. If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other  insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will  not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for  lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject  to the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of  insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of  insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. below applies.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess  insurance, this policy will be primary.</p><p class="depth0">c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible)  up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as  described in C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached,  this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of  insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies,  for the remainder of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where this policy covers a condominium association and there is a  flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same  loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.</p><p class="depth0">D. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment</p><p class="depth0">This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be  waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance  Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy can  constitute a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in  writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except  under these conditions:</p><p class="depth0">1. When this policy covers only personal property; or</p><p class="depth0">2. When this policy covers a structure during the course of  construction.</p><p class="depth0">E. Cancellation of Policy by You</p><p class="depth0">1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the applicable  rules and regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or  partial refund of premium also under the applicable rules and  regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">F. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us</p><p class="depth0">Your policy will not be renewed:</p><p class="depth0">1. If the community where your covered property is located stops  participating in the NFIP; or</p><p class="depth0">2. If your building has been declared ineligible under section 1316  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">G. Reduction and Reformation of Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. If the premium we received from you was not enough to buy the  kind and amount of coverage that you requested, we will provide only the  amount of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we  received.</p><p class="depth0">2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount of coverage  resulting from the reduction described in G.1. above to the amount you  requested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information Before a Loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion  of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount  of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional  premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the  policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested  amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or  subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term,  we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional  information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be  increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information After a Loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms.  If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30  days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the  amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the  beginning of the prior policy term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior  policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is  due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced  amount of coverage. The amount of coverage can only be increased by  endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not  tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did  anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of  Condition B. above apply.</p><p class="depth0">H. Policy Renewal</p><p class="depth0">1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the  policy term.</p><p class="depth0">2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium  within 30 days of the expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice  into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,  e.g., we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which  delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium,  then we will follow these procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after  the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of  nonreceipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal  premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding  paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due  date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</p><p class="depth0">b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by  the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case,  the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date  shown on the Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you  during the policy term to re-certify, on a Recertification Questionnaire  that we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your  most recent application for or renewal of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">I. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance</p><p class="depth0">We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that  is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</p><p class="depth0">J. Requirements in Case of Loss</p><p class="depth0">In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</p><p class="depth0">1. Give prompt written notice to us;</p><p class="depth0">2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and  undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may  examine it;</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity,  description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills,  receipts, and related documents;</p><p class="depth0">4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is  your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed  and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following  information:</p><p class="depth0">a. The date and time of loss;</p><p class="depth0">b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</p><p class="depth0">c. Your interest (for example, ``owner'') and the interest, if any,  of others in the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</p><p class="depth0">e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the  term of the policy;</p><p class="depth0">f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair  estimates;</p><p class="depth0">g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or  claim against the insured property;</p><p class="depth0">h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of  loss and for what purpose; and</p><p class="depth0">i. The inventory of damaged property described in J.3. above.</p><p class="depth0">5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment  concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</p><p class="depth0">6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the  investigation of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may  furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you  complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must  still send us a proof of loss within sixty days after the loss even if  the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</p><p class="depth0">8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove  claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</p><p class="depth0">9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss  instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include  information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign  the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the  report.</p><p class="depth0">K. Our Options After a Loss</p><p class="depth0">Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include  the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you  must:</p><p class="depth0">a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of  another insured, and sign the same; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and  the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Condominium association documents including the Declarations of  the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws,  and rules and regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All books of accounts, bills, invoices, and other vouchers, or  certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are  lost.</p><p class="depth0">2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete  inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:</p><p class="depth0">a. Quantities and costs;</p><p class="depth0">b. Actual cash values;</p><p class="depth0">c. Amounts of loss claimed;</p><p class="depth0">d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged  property that you can reasonably make available to us; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive  your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or  destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or  its functional equivalent; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we  agree upon or its appraised value.</p><p class="depth0">L. No Benefit to Bailee</p><p class="depth0">No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered  property will benefit from this insurance.</p><p class="depth0">M. Loss Payment</p><p class="depth0">1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some  other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to  receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your  proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files an  adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss)  and:</p><p class="depth0">a. We reach an agreement with you;</p><p class="depth0">b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</p><p class="depth0">c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in  VII. P.</p><p class="depth0">2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Accept such denial of your claim;</p><p class="depth0">b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</p><p class="depth0">c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60  days of the date of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">N. Abandonment</p><p class="depth0">You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.</p><p class="depth0">O. Salvage</p><p class="depth0">We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and  we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the  policy by the value of the salvage.</p><p class="depth0">P. Appraisal</p><p class="depth0">If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value of the damaged  property so as to determine the amount of loss, either may demand an  appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a  competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a  written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an  umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we  may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in  the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will  separately state the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each  item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us,  the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to  agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision  agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss.</p><p class="depth0">Each party will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Pay its own appraiser; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</p><p class="depth0">Q. Mortgage Clause</p><p class="depth0">The word ``mortgagee'' includes trustee.</p><p class="depth0">Any loss payable under Coverage A--Building Property will be paid to  any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other  mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and  you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order  of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.  If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of  the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</p><p class="depth0">1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or  substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;</p><p class="depth0">2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have  neglected to pay the premium; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after  receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</p><p class="depth0">All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth0">The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the  mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</p><p class="depth0">If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in  effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify  the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</p><p class="depth0">If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are  subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage  on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee  to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</p><p class="depth0">R. Suit Against Us</p><p class="depth0">You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you  have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If   you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the  written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit  in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured  property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to  any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that  you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</p><p class="depth0">S. Subrogation</p><p class="depth0">Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are  subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person.  That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or  totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to  the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to  acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give  up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us  from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused  your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you  may keep any of that money.</p><p class="depth0">T. Continuous Lake Flooding</p><p class="depth0">1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters  continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that  a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the  insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits  plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one  building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without  waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</p><p class="depth0">a. To make no further claim under this policy;</p><p class="depth0">b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</p><p class="depth0">c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property  at the described location; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</p><p class="depth0">If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded  continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will  apply when as the insured building suffers a covered loss before the  policy term ends.</p><p class="depth0">2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding  from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either  paragraph T.1. above or this paragraph T.2. (A ``closed basin lake'' is  a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and  whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any  time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are  in the western half of the United States, where annual evaporation  exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are  subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the  climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under  this paragraph T.2 we will pay your claim as if the building is a total  loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days,  subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage  your building.</p><p class="depth0">b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the  salvage on a negotiated basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's ``Policy  Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,'' to be recorded in the office of the  local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in  which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas  of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood  damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the  agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that  portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural  and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will  allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain, simple  agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable  structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under  the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph  T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project  or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the  property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas  protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then  no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.</p><p class="depth0">c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your  building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an  additional 30 days to move if you show that there is sufficient reason  to extend the time.</p><p class="depth0">d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an  elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local  floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</p><p class="depth0">e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having  jurisdiction over your building must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium  for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a  permanent land use ordinance,   that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement  required in paragraph T.2.b. above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to  FEMA so that under Sec. 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of  1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible  with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected  property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions  must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above except  that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use  restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance  Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property  as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed- restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</p><p class="depth0">f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take  all action set forth in FEMA's ``Policy Guidance for Closed Basin  Lakes.''</p><p class="depth0">g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in  effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this  paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into  effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in  coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this  continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim  under this paragraph T.2, we will not consider to be in effect any  increased coverage that became effective after the date established by  FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount  suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the  FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the  community, in writing, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance  with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</p><p class="depth0">U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed</p><p class="depth0">1. Property may not be insured under more than one NFIP policy.</p><p class="depth0">If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will  give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose  one of several options under the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased  coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will  the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage  under the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will  make a refund to you, according to applicable NFIP rules, of the premium  for the policy not being kept in effect.</p><p class="depth0">2. Your option under this Condition U. Duplicate Policies Not  Allowed to elect which NFIP policy to keep in effect does not apply when  duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such  circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of  the earlier policy. The policy with the later effective date must be  canceled.</p><p class="depth0">V. Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">We will pay the least of the following amounts after application of  the deductible:</p><p class="depth0">1. The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;</p><p class="depth0">2. The actual cash value; or</p><p class="depth0">3. The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with  material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the  loss.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Liberalization Clause</p><p class="depth0">If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition  of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that  change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we  implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls  within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the  Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">IX.

This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain  management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the  National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal  Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3.

(This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones  which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also  includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are  being increased, and a flood-damaged structure must comply with the  higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance  coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the  community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or  floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged structures to elevations  derived solely by the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to  meet State or local ``freeboard'' requirements, i.e., that a structure  must be elevated above the base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and  communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of structures in  unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is  obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance  activities are also eligible for Coverage D.</p><p class="depth0">d. This coverage will also pay for the incremental cost, after  demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a structure  during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local  floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion  D.5.g.below relating to improvements.</p><p class="depth0">e. This coverage will also pay to bring a flood-damaged structure  into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or  ordinances even if the structure had received a variance before the  present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.</p><p class="depth0">4. Conditions.</p><p class="depth0">a. When a structure covered under Coverage A--Building Property  sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this  Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof,  relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by  the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management  ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will  be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or  a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local  floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the  cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue  utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site  utilities.</p><p class="depth0">b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for  the same occupancy   as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain  management ordinances or laws.</p><p class="depth0">5. Exclusions.</p><p class="depth0">Under this Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance, we will not pay  for:</p><p class="depth0">a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or  ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.</p><p class="depth0">b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that  requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove,  contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or  assess the effects of pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">c. The loss in value to any insured building or other structure due  to the requirements of any ordinance or law.</p><p class="depth0">d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building  demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local  floodplain management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated on the same or to another premises; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or  relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed  two years.</p><p class="depth0">f. Any code upgrade requirements, e.g., plumbing or electrical  wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain  management law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or  improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or  local floodplain management laws or ordinances.</p><p class="depth0">h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply  with before the current loss.</p><p class="depth0">i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's  minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has  received from the State or community a variance in connection with the  current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the  base flood elevation.</p><p class="depth0">j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.</p><p class="depth0">k. Any structure insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.</p><p class="depth0">l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual  condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly  owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local  floodplain management ordinances or laws.</p><p class="depth0">6. Other Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the  calculation to determine whether coverage meets the coinsurance  requirement for replacement cost coverage under VIII. General  Conditions, V. Loss Settlement.</p><p class="depth0">b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Property Not Covered</p><p class="depth0">We do not cover any of the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. Personal property not inside the fully enclosed building;</p><p class="depth0">2. A building, and personal property in it, located entirely in, on,  or over water or seaward of mean high tide, if constructed or  substantially improved after September 30, 1982;</p><p class="depth0">3.

Buildings and all their contents if more than 49% of the actual  cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is  at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of  earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy  efficient building techniques;</p><p class="depth0">12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers,  bridges, and docks;</p><p class="depth0">13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment;</p><p class="depth0">14.

Personal property used in connection with any incidental  commercial occupancy or use of the building.</p><p class="depth0">V. Exclusions</p><p class="depth0">A. We only pay for direct physical loss by or from flood, which  means that we do not pay you for:</p><p class="depth0">1. Loss of revenue or profits;</p><p class="depth0">2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;</p><p class="depth0">3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;</p><p class="depth0">4.

The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or  regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or  repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This  exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities that we describe in  Coverage D--Increased Cost of Compliance; or</p><p class="depth0">7. Any other economic loss.</p><p class="depth0">B. We do not insure a loss directly or indirectly caused by a flood  that is already in progress at the time and date:</p><p class="depth0">1. The policy term begins; or</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage is added at your request.</p><p class="depth0">C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth  movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of  earth movement that we do not cover are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0">2. Landslide;</p><p class="depth0">3. Land subsidence;</p><p class="depth0">4. Sinkholes;</p><p class="depth0">5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from  accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or</p><p class="depth0">6. Gradual erosion.</p><p class="depth0">We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a  result of erosion that are specifically covered under our definition of  flood (see II.A.1.c. and II.A.2.).</p><p class="depth0">D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or  indirectly by:</p><p class="depth0">1. The pressure or weight of ice;</p><p class="depth0">2. Freezing or thawing;</p><p class="depth0">3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;</p><p class="depth0">4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily  from any condition:</p><p class="depth0">a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or</p><p class="depth0">b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Design, structural, or mechanical defects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines,  drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood  recedes;</p><p class="depth0">5. Water or water-borne material that:</p><p class="depth0">a. Backs up through sewers or drains;</p><p class="depth0">b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related  equipment; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Seeps or leaks on or through insured property; unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause  of the sewer, drain, or sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage  of water;</p><p class="depth0">6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the  area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the  pressure or weight of water.</p><p class="depth0">7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results  from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating or cooling  equipment situated on the described location;</p><p class="depth0">8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;</p><p class="depth0">9. Anything you or your agents do or conspire to do to cause loss by  flood deliberately; or</p><p class="depth0">10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases  the risk of flooding.</p><p class="depth0">E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property  located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or  incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where  the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood  insurance issued under any Federal Government program.</p><p class="depth0">F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants  unless required by law or ordinance.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Deductibles</p><p class="depth0">A. When a loss is covered under this policy, we will pay only that  part of the loss that exceeds the applicable deductible amount, subject  to the limit of insurance that applies. The deductible amount is shown  on the Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair  does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof  at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the  deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.</p><p class="depth0">B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the  building and personal property insured by this policy.</p><p class="depth0">C. No deductible applies to:</p><p class="depth0">1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or</p><p class="depth0">2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Coinsurance</p><p class="depth0">A. This Coinsurance Section applies only to coverage on the  building.</p><p class="depth0">B. We will impose a penalty on loss payment unless the amount of  insurance applicable to the damaged building is:</p><p class="depth0">1. At least 80% of its replacement cost; or</p><p class="depth0">2. The maximum amount of insurance available for that building under  the NFIP, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">C. If the actual amount of insurance on the building is less than  the required amount in accordance with the terms of VII. B. above, then  loss payment is determined as follows (subject to all other relevant  conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to valuation,  adjustment, settlement, and payment of loss):</p><p class="depth0">1. Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the building by  the required amount of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the  deductible, by the figure determined in C.1. above.</p><p class="depth0">3. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in C.2. above.</p><p class="depth0">We will pay the amount determined in C.3. above, or the amount of  insurance carried, whichever is less. The amount of insurance carried,  if in excess of the applicable maximum amount of insurance available  under the NFIP, is reduced accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">Examples</p><p class="depth0">Example 1 (Inadequate Insurance)  Replacement value of the building--$250,000 Required amount of insurance--$200,000</p><p class="depth0">(80% of replacement value of $250,000) Actual amount of insurance carried--$180,000 Amount of the loss--$150,000 Deductible--$500 Step 1:180,000 / 200,000 = .90</p><p class="depth0">(90% of what should be carried.) Step 2: 150,000 x .90 = 135,000 Step 3: 135,000 - 500 = 134,500</p><p class="depth0">We will pay no more than $134,500. The remaining $15,500 is not  covered due to the coinsurance penalty ($15,000) and application of the  deductible ($500).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2 (Adequate Insurance)  Replacement value of the building--$500,000 Required amount of insurance--$400,000</p><p class="depth0">(80% of replacement value of $500,000) Actual amount of insurance carried--$400,000 Amount of the loss--$200,000 Deductible--$500</p><p class="depth0">In this example there is no coinsurance penalty, because the actual  amount of insurance carried meets the required amount. We will pay no  more than $199,500 ($200,000 amount of loss minus the $500 deductible).</p><p class="depth0">D. In calculating the full replacement cost of a building:</p><p class="depth0">1. The replacement cost value of any covered building property will  be included;</p><p class="depth0">2. The replacement cost value of any building property not covered  under this policy will not be included; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Only the replacement cost value of improvements installed by the  condominium association will be included.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. General Conditions</p><p class="depth0">A. Pair and Set Clause.</p><p class="depth0">In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will  have the option of paying you:</p><p class="depth0">1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or  destroyed article, less depreciation; or</p><p class="depth0">2. An amount which represents the fair proportion of the total value  of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to  the pair or set.</p><p class="depth0">B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance.</p><p class="depth0">1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy:</p><p class="depth0">a. Is void,</p><p class="depth0">b. Has no legal force or effect,</p><p class="depth0">c. Cannot be renewed, and</p><p class="depth0">d. Cannot be replaced by a new NFIP policy, if, before or after a  loss, you or any other insured or your agent have at any time:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or  circumstance,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engaged in fraudulent conduct, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Made false statements, relating to this policy or any other NFIP insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. This policy will be void as of the date the wrongful acts  described in B.1. above were committed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal  laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.</p><p class="depth0">4. This policy is also void for reasons other than fraud,  misrepresentation, or wrongful act. This policy is void from its  inception and has no legal force under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the property is located in a community that was not  participating in the NFIP on the policy's inception date and did not  join or re-enter the program during the policy term and before the loss  occurred; or</p><p class="depth0">b. If the property listed on the application is not otherwise  eligible for coverage under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">C. Other Insurance.</p><p class="depth0">1. If a loss covered by this policy is also covered by other  insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will  not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for  lost, damaged or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to  the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of  insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of  insurance covering the loss, unless C.1.b. or c. immediately below  applies.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess  insurance, this policy will be primary.</p><p class="depth0">c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible)  up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as  described in C.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached,  this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of  insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies,  for the remainder of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">2. If there is a flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner  that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be  primary.</p><p class="depth0">D. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment.</p><p class="depth0">This policy cannot be changed nor can any of its provisions be  waived without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance  Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy  constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in  writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except  under these conditions:</p><p class="depth0">1. When this policy covers only personal property; or</p><p class="depth0">2. When this policy covers a structure during the course of  construction.</p><p class="depth0">E. Cancellation of Policy by You.</p><p class="depth0">1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the applicable  rules and regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or  partial refund of premium also under the applicable rules and  regulations of the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">F. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us.</p><p class="depth0">Your policy will not be renewed:</p><p class="depth0">1. If the community where your covered property is located stops  participating in the NFIP, or</p><p class="depth0">2. Your building has been declared ineligible under section 1316 of  the Act.</p><p class="depth0">G. Reduction and Reformation of Coverage.</p><p class="depth0">1. If the premium we received from you was not enough to buy the  kind and amount of coverage you requested, we will provide only the  amount of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we  received.</p><p class="depth0">2. The policy can be reformed to increase the amount of coverage  resulting from the reduction described in G.1. above the amount that you  requested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information Before a Loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover before you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion  of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount  of coverage). If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional  premium within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the  policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested  amount effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or  subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we determine before you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information within 60 days of our request. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term,  we will follow the procedure in G.2.a.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium (or additional  information) by the date it is due, the amount of coverage can only be  increased by endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Incomplete Rating  Information After a Loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that your premium  payment was not enough to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will  send you and any mortgagee or trustee known to us a bill for the  required additional premium for the current and the prior policy terms.  If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional premium within 30  days of the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the  amount of coverage to the originally requested amount effective to the  beginning of the prior policy term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If we discover after you have a flood loss that the rating  information we have is incomplete and prevents us from calculating the  additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information.  You must submit the information before your claim can be paid. Once we  determine the amount of additional premium for the current and prior  policy terms, we will follow the procedure in G.2.b.(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we do not receive the additional premium by the date it is  due, your flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced  amount of coverage. The amount of coverage can only be increased by  endorsement subject to any appropriate waiting period.</p><p class="depth0">3. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not  tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did  anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of  Condition B. Concealment or Fraud and Policy Voidance above apply.</p><p class="depth0">H. Policy Renewal.</p><p class="depth0">1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the  policy term.</p><p class="depth0">2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium  within 30 days of the expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice  into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,  e.g., we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which  delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium,  then we will follow these procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after  the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of  nonreceipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal  premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding  paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due  date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.</p><p class="depth0">b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by  the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case,  the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date  shown on the Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you  during the policy term to re-certify, on a Recertification Questionnaire  that we will provide you, the rating information used to rate your most  recent application for or renewal of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">I. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance.</p><p class="depth0">We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that  is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.</p><p class="depth0">J. Requirements in Case of Loss.</p><p class="depth0">In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:</p><p class="depth0">1. Give prompt written notice to us;</p><p class="depth0">2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and  undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may  examine it;</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepare an inventory of damaged personal property showing the  quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all  bills, receipts and related documents;</p><p class="depth0">4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is  your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed  and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following  information:</p><p class="depth0">a. The date and time of loss;</p><p class="depth0">b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;</p><p class="depth0">c. Your interest (for example, ``owner'') and the interest, if any,  of others in the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;</p><p class="depth0">e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the  term of the policy;</p><p class="depth0">f. Specifications of damaged insured buildings and detailed repair  estimates;</p><p class="depth0">g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or  claim against the insured property;</p><p class="depth0">h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of  loss and for what purpose; and</p><p class="depth0">i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in J.3.  above.</p><p class="depth0">5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment  concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.</p><p class="depth0">6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the  investigation of the claim.</p><p class="depth0">7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may  furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you  complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must  still send us a proof of loss within sixty days after the loss even if  the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.</p><p class="depth0">8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove  claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.</p><p class="depth0">9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss  instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include  information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign  the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the  report.</p><p class="depth0">K. Our Options After a Loss.</p><p class="depth0">Options that we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss  include the following:</p><p class="depth0">1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you  must:</p><p class="depth0">a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;</p><p class="depth0">b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of  another insured, and sign the same; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and  the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Condominium association documents including the Declarations of  the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws,  and rules and regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or  certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are  lost.</p><p class="depth0">2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete  inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:</p><p class="depth0">a. Quantities and costs;</p><p class="depth0">b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is  appropriate);</p><p class="depth0">c. Amounts of loss claimed;</p><p class="depth0">d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged  property that you can make reasonably available to us; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.</p><p class="depth0">3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive  your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or  destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or  its functional equivalent; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value we  agree upon or its appraised value.</p><p class="depth0">L. No Benefit to Bailee.</p><p class="depth0">No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered  property will benefit from this insurance.</p><p class="depth0">M. Loss Payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some  other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to  receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your  proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files an  adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss)  and:</p><p class="depth0">a. We reach an agreement with you;</p><p class="depth0">b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or</p><p class="depth0">c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in  VIII. P.</p><p class="depth0">2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:</p><p class="depth0">a. Accept such denial of your claim;</p><p class="depth0">b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or</p><p class="depth0">c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60  days of the date of the loss.</p><p class="depth0">N. Abandonment.</p><p class="depth0">You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.</p><p class="depth0">O. Salvage.</p><p class="depth0">We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and  we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the  policy by the value of the salvage.</p><p class="depth0">P. Appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if  applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so as to determine  the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In  this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial  appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the  other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree  upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be  made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured  property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual  cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item.  If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the  amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree,  they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to  by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it  applies, the replacement cost and loss.</p><p class="depth0">Each party will:</p><p class="depth0">1. Pay its own appraiser; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.</p><p class="depth0">Q. Mortgage Clause.</p><p class="depth0">The word ``mortgagee'' includes trustee.</p><p class="depth0">Any loss payable under Coverage A--Building will be paid to any  mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee  or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as  interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of  payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim  of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:</p><p class="depth0">1. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or  substantial change in risk, of which the mortgagee is aware;</p><p class="depth0">2. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have  neglected to pay the premium; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after  receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.</p><p class="depth0">All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth0">The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the  mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.</p><p class="depth0">If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in  effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify  the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.</p><p class="depth0">If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are  subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage  on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee  to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.</p><p class="depth0">R. Suit Against Us.</p><p class="depth0">You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you  have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue,  you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written  denial of all or part of the claim and you must file the suit in the  United States District Court of the district in which the insured  property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to  any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that  you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.</p><p class="depth0">S. Subrogation.</p><p class="depth0">Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are  subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person.  That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or  totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to  the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to  acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give  up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us  from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused  your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you  may keep any of that money.</p><p class="depth0">T. Continuous Lake Flooding.</p><p class="depth0">1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters  continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that  a continuation of this flooding will result in a covered loss to the  insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits  plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one  building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without  waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:</p><p class="depth0">a. To make no further claim under this policy;</p><p class="depth0">b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;</p><p class="depth0">c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property  at the described location; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.</p><p class="depth0">If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded  continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph T.1. will  apply as long as the insured building suffers a covered loss before the  policy term ends.</p><p class="depth0">2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding  from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either  paragraph T.1. above or this paragraph T.2. (A ``closed basin lake'' is  a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and  whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any  time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are  in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation  exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are  subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the  climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under  this paragraph T.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total  loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days,  subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0">a. Lake flood waters must damage or imminently threaten to damage  your building.</p><p class="depth0">b. Before approval of your claim, you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the  salvage on a negotiated basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grant the conservation easement contained in FEMA's ``Policy  Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,'' to be recorded in the office of the  local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in  which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas  of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood  damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the  agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that  portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural  and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will  allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple  agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable  structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under  the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph  T.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project  or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the  property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas  protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then  no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Comply with paragraphs T.1.a. through T.1.d. above.</p><p class="depth0">c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your  building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an  additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to  extend the time.</p><p class="depth0">d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an  elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local  floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.</p><p class="depth0">e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having  jurisdiction over your building must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium  for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a  permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions  specified in the easement required in paragraph T.2.b. above;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to  FEMA so that under Sec. 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of  1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible  with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected  property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions  must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above, except  that even if a certified   project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to  apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant  Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land  trust organization receives the property as a donation, that  organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent  with the provisions of paragraph T.2.b. above.</p><p class="depth0">f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take  all action set forth in FEMA's ``Policy Guidance for Closed Basin  Lakes.''</p><p class="depth0">g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in  effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this  paragraph T.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into  effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in  coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this  continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim  under this paragraph T.2., we will not consider to be in effect any  increased coverage that became effective after the date established by  FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount  suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">h. This paragraph T.2. will be in effect for a community when the  FEMA Regional Director for the affected region provides to the  community, in writing, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance  with the conditions in paragraphs T.2.e. and T.2.f. above, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.</p><p class="depth0">U. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed.</p><p class="depth0">1. We will not insure your property under more than one NFIP policy.</p><p class="depth0">If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will  give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose  one of several options under the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0">a. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the earlier  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  later policy to the limits of the earlier policy. The change will become  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">b. If you choose to keep in effect the policy with the later  effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the  earlier policy to the limits of the later policy. The change will be  effective as of the effective date of the later policy.</p><p class="depth0">In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased  coverage limits within 30 days of the written notice. In no event will  the resulting coverage limits exceed the permissible limits of coverage  under the Act or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will  make a refund to you, according to applicable NFIP rules, of the premium  for the policy not being kept in effect.</p><p class="depth0">2. The insured's option under this condition U. Duplicate Policies  Not Allowed to elect which NFIP policy to keep in effect does not apply  when duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such  circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of  the earlier policy. The policy with the later effective date must be  canceled.</p><p class="depth0">V. Loss Settlement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement  Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is  used for a different type of property, as explained in a.-c. below.</p><p class="depth0">a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement described in V.2. below applies  to buildings other than manufactured homes or travel trailers.</p><p class="depth0">b. Special Loss Settlement described in V.3. below applies to a  residential condominium building that is a travel trailer or a  manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">c. Actual Cash Value loss settlement applies to all other property  covered under this policy, as outlined in V.4. below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">a. We will pay to repair or replace a damaged or destroyed building,  after application of the deductible and without deduction for  depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the  building;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The replacement cost of that part of the building damaged, with  materials of like kind and quality, and for like occupancy and use; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the  damaged part of the building for like occupancy and use.</p><p class="depth0">b. We will not be liable for any loss on a Replacement Cost Coverage  basis unless and until actual repair or replacement of the damaged  building or parts thereof, is completed.</p><p class="depth0">c. If a building is rebuilt at a location other than the described  location, we will pay no more than it would have cost to repair or  rebuild at the described location, subject to all other terms of  Replacement Cost Loss Settlement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Special Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a residential  condominium building that is: (1) a manufactured home or travel trailer,  as defined in II.B.6.b. and c., and (2) at least 16 feet wide when fully  assembled and has at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls  when fully assembled.</p><p class="depth0">b. If such a building is totally destroyed or damaged to such an  extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair,  at least to its pre-damaged condition, we will, at our discretion, pay  the least of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The lesser of the replacement cost of the manufactured home or  travel trailer or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Building Limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">c. If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is partially  damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it  to its pre-damaged condition, we will settle the loss according to the  Replacement Cost Loss Settlement conditions in V.2. above.</p><p class="depth0">4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement</p><p class="depth0">a. The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash  value loss settlement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Personal property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Insured property abandoned after a loss and that remains as  debris at the described location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Outside antennas and aerials, awning, and other outdoor  equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carpeting and pads;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Appliances; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A manufactured home or mobile home or a travel trailer as  defined in II.B.6.b. or c. that does not meet the conditions for special  loss settlement in V.3. above.</p><p class="depth0">b. We will pay the least of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The actual cash value (as defined in II.B.2.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with  material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the  loss.</p><p class="depth0">IX. Liberalization Clause</p><p class="depth0">If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition  of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that  change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we  implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls  within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the  Declarations Page.</p><p class="depth0">X. What Law Governs</p><p class="depth0">This policy and all disputes arising from the handling of any claim  under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance  regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as  amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and Federal common law.</p><p class="depth0">In Witness Whereof, we have signed this policy below and hereby  enter into this Insurance Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator, Federal Insurance Administration.
