                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Validity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reentry permit. Except as provided in Sec.  223.2(c)(2), a reentry permit issued to a permanent resident shall be  valid for 2 years from the date of issuance. A reentry permit issued to  a conditional permanent resident shall be valid for 2 years from the  date of issuance, or to the date the conditional permanent resident must  apply for removal of the conditions on his or her status, whichever  comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refugee travel document. A refugee travel document shall be  valid for 1 year, or to the date the refugee or asylee status expires,  whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Invalidation. A document issued under this part is invalid if  obtained through material false representation or concealment, or if the  person is ordered excluded or deported. A refugee travel document is  also invalid if the United Nations Convention of July 28, 1951, ceases  to apply or does not apply to the person as provided in Article 1C, D,  E, or F of the convention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension. A reentry permit or refugee travel document may not  be extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect on admissibility--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reentry permit. A permanent  resident or conditional permanent resident in possession of a valid  reentry permit who is otherwise admissible shall not be deemed to have  abandoned status based solely on the duration of an absence or absences  while the permit is valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refugee travel document--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and immigration status.  Upon arrival in the United States, an alien who presents a valid  unexpired refugee travel document, or who has been allowed to file an  application for a refugee travel document and this application has been  approved under the procedure set forth in Sec. 223.2(b)(2)(ii), shall  be examined as to his or her admissibility under the Act. An alien shall  be accorded the immigration status endorsed in his or her refugee travel  document, or (in the case of an alien discussed in Sec.  223.2(b)(2)(ii)) which will be endorsed in such document, unless he or  she is no longer eligible for that status, or he or she applies for and  is found eligible for some other immigration status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inadmissibility. If an alien who presents a valid unexpired  refugee travel document appears to the examining immigration officer to  be inadmissible, he or she shall be referred for proceedings under  section 240 of the Act. Section 235(c) of the Act shall not be  applicable.  [59 FR 1464, Jan. 11, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 10353, Mar. 6, 1997]</p>
