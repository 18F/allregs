                            <p class="depth0">You can demonstrate that your facility is not a major source by  using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emission option. You must demonstrate that your facility does  not emit, and does not have the potential to emit as defined in Sec.  63.2, considering federally enforceable permit limits, 9.1 megagrams (10  tons) or more per year of a single HAP or 22.7 megagrams (25 tons) or  more per year of a combination of HAP. To calculate your facility's  potential to emit, you must include emissions from the boat  manufacturing facility and all other sources that are collocated and  under common ownership or control with the boat manufacturing facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>, (2), or (3) of this section to become an area  source, but then exceed the relevant limit (without first obtaining and  complying with other limits that keep your potential to emit HAP below  major source levels), your facility will then become a major source, and  you must comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart beginning  on the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.5695. Nothing in this  paragraph is intended to preclude you from limiting your facility's  potential to emit through other federally enforceable mechanisms  available through your permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If your facility is primarily a fiberglass boat manufacturing  facility, you must demonstrate that you consume less than 45.4 megagrams  per rolling 12-month period of all combined polyester-and vinylester- based resins and gel coats (including tooling and production resins and  gel coats, and clear gel coats), and you must demonstrate that at least  90 percent of   total annual HAP emissions at the facility (including emissions from  aluminum recreational boat manufacturing or other source categories)  originate from the fiberglass boat manufacturing materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your facility is primarily an aluminum recreational boat  manufacturing facility, you must demonstrate that it consumes less than  18.2 megagrams per rolling 12-month period of all combined surface  coatings, aluminum wipedown solvents, application gun cleaning solvents,  and carpet and fabric adhesives; and you must demonstrate that at least  90 percent of total annual HAP emissions at the facility (including  emissions from fiberglass boat manufacturing or other source categories)  originate from the aluminum recreational boat manufacturing materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your facility is a fiberglass boat or an aluminum  recreational boat manufacturing facility, you must demonstrate that the  boat manufacturing materials consumed per rolling 12-month period  contain a total of less than 4.6 megagrams of any single HAP and less  than 11.4 megagrams of all combined HAP, and you must demonstrate that  at least 90 percent of total annual HAP emissions at the facility  (including emissions from other source categories) originate from these  boat manufacturing materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em>  through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If your facility has HAP emissions that do not originate from  boat manufacturing operations or materials described in paragraph (b),  then you must keep any records necessary to demonstrate that the 90  percent criterion is met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A rolling 12-month period includes the previous 12 months of  operation. You must maintain records of the total amount of materials  described in paragraph (b) of this section used each month, and, if  necessary, the HAP content of each material and the calculation of the  total HAP consumed each month. Because records are needed for a 12-month  period, you must keep records beginning no later than 12 months before  the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.5695. Records must be kept for  5 years after they are created.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining whether the 90 percent criterion included in  paragraph (b) of this section is met, you do not need to include  materials used in routine janitorial, building, or facility grounds  maintenance; personal uses by employees or other persons; or products  used for maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility.</p>
