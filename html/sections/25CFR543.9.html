(1) Controls must be established and procedures implemented to record, track, and reconcile all redeemed pull tabs and pull tab payouts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The redeemed pull tabs must be defaced so that they cannot be redeemed for payment again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pull tabs that are uniquely identifiable with a machine readable code (including, but not limited to a

barcode) may be redeemed, reconciled, and stored by kiosks without the need for defacing, so long as the redeemed pull tabs are secured and destroyed after removal from the kiosk in accordance with the procedures approved by the TGRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At least two agents must document and verify all prize payouts above $600, or lower threshold as authorized by management and approved by the TGRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An automated method may substitute for one verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The predetermined threshold must be authorized by management, approved by the TGRA, documented, and maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Total payout must be calculated and recorded by shift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Pull tab operating funds.

These investigations must be documented, maintained for inspection, and provided to the TGRA upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Revenue audit. Standards for revenue audit of pull tabs are contained in Sec. 543.24, Revenue Audit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Variances. The operation must establish, as approved by the TGRA, the threshold level at which a variance must be reviewed to determine the cause. Any such review must be documented.</p>
