                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the rules for calculating the  credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction or a securities  financing transaction entered into by a national bank or savings  association for purposes of determining the bank's or savings  association's lending limit pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 84 or 12 U.S.C.  1464(u), as applicable, and this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Derivative transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-credit derivatives. Subject to  paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, a national bank or  savings association shall calculate the credit exposure to a  counterparty arising from a derivative transaction by one of the  following methods. Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a  national bank or savings association shall use the same method for  calculating counterparty credit exposure arising from all of its  derivative transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Model Method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Credit exposure. The credit exposure of a  derivative transaction under the Internal Model Method shall equal the  sum of the current credit exposure of the derivative transaction and the  potential future credit exposure of the derivative transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Calculation of current credit exposure. A bank or savings  association shall determine its current credit exposure by the mark-to- market value of the derivative contract. If the mark-to-   market value is positive, then the current credit exposure equals that  mark-to-market value. If the mark to market value is zero or negative,  than the current credit exposure is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Calculation of potential future credit exposure. (1) A bank or  savings association shall calculate its potential future credit exposure  by using either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An internal model the use of which has been approved in writing  for purposes of 12 CFR 3.132(d) or 324.132(d), as appropriate, provided  that the bank or savings association provides prior written notice to  the appropriate Federal banking agency of its use for purposes of this  section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other appropriate model the use of which has been approved  in writing for purposes of this section by the appropriate Federal  banking agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any substantive revisions to a model made after the bank or  savings association has provided notice of the use of the model to the  appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(C)(1)(i) of this section or after the appropriate Federal  banking agency has approved the use of the model pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(C)(1)(ii) of this section must be approved by the agency  before a bank or savings association may use the revised model for  purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Net credit exposure. A bank or savings association that  calculates its credit exposure by using the Internal Model Method  pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)(i) may net credit exposures of  derivative transactions arising under the same qualifying master netting  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conversion Factor Matrix Method. The credit exposure arising  from a derivative transaction under the Conversion Factor Matrix Method  shall equal and remain fixed at the potential future credit exposure of  the derivative transaction which shall equal the product of the notional  amount of the derivative transaction and a fixed multiplicative factor  determined by reference to Table 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Conversion Factor Matrix for Calculating Potential Future Credit Exposure \1\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Other \3\</p><p class="depth0">(includes</p><p class="depth0">Original maturity \2\           Interest rate     Foreign exchange         Equity         commodities and</p><p class="depth0">rate and gold                         precious metals</p><p class="depth0">except gold) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 year or less...................                .015                .015                .20                 .06 Over 1 to 3 years................                .03                 .03                 .20                 .18 Over 3 to 5 years................                .06                 .06                 .20                 .30 Over 5 to 10 years...............                .12                 .12                 .20                 .60 Over ten years...................                .30                 .30                 .20                1.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ For an OTC derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by</p><p class="depth0">the number of remaining payments in the derivative contract. \2\ For an OTC derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is</p><p class="depth0">settled and the terms are reset so that the market value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity</p><p class="depth0">equals the time until the next reset date. For an interest rate derivative contract with a remaining maturity</p><p class="depth0">of greater than one year that meets these criteria, the minimum conversion factor is 0.005. \3\ Transactions not explicitly covered by any other column in the Table are to be treated as ``Other.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Current Exposure Method. The credit exposure arising from a  derivative transaction (other than a credit derivative transaction)  under the Current Exposure Method shall be calculated pursuant to 12 CFR  3.132(c)(5), (6), and (7) or 324.132(c)(5), (6), and (7), as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Credit Derivatives--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Counterparty exposure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section and subject to  paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a national bank or savings  association that uses the Conversion Factor Matrix Method or the Current  Exposure Method, or that uses the Model Method without entering an  effective margining arrangement as defined in Sec. 32.2(l), shall  calculate the counterparty credit exposure arising from credit  derivatives entered by the bank or savings association by adding the net  notional value of all protection purchased from the counterparty on each  reference entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for certain effective margining arrangements. A  bank or savings association must add the EMA threshold amount to the  counterparty   credit exposure arising from credit derivatives calculated under the  Model Method. The EMA threshold is the amount under an effective  margining arrangement with respect to which the counterparty is not  required to post variation margin to fully collateralize the amount of  the bank's or savings association's net credit exposure to the  counterparty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reference entity exposure. A national bank or savings  association shall calculate the credit exposure to a reference entity  arising from credit derivatives entered into by the bank or savings  association by adding the net notional value of all protection sold on  the reference entity. A bank or savings association may reduce its  exposure to a reference entity by the amount of any eligible credit  derivative purchased on that reference entity from an eligible  protection provider.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for central counterparties. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In addition to  amounts calculated under Sec. 32.9(b)(1) and (2), the measure of  counterparty exposure to a central counterparty shall also include the  sum of the initial margin posted by the bank or savings association,  plus any contributions made by it to a guaranty fund at the time such  contribution is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to a  national bank or saving association that uses an internal model pursuant  to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if such model reflects the  initial margin and any contributions to a guaranty fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mandatory or alternative method. The appropriate Federal banking  agency may in its discretion require or permit a national bank or  savings association to use a specific method or methods set forth in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section to calculate the credit exposure  arising from all derivative transactions or any specific, or category  of, derivative transactions if it finds, in its discretion, that such  method is consistent with the safety and soundness of the bank or  savings association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Securities financing transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a national bank or savings  association shall calculate the credit exposure arising from a  securities financing transaction by one of the following methods. A  national bank or savings association shall use the same method for  calculating credit exposure arising from all of its securities financing  transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Model Method. (A) A national bank or savings association may  calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing transaction by  using either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An internal model the use of which has been approved in writing  by the appropriate Federal banking agency for purposes of 12 CFR  3.132(b) or 324.132(b), as appropriate, provided the bank or savings  association provides prior written notice to the appropriate Federal  banking agency of its use for purposes of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any other appropriate model the use of which has been approved  in writing for purposes of this section by the appropriate Federal  banking agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any substantive revisions to a model made after the bank or  savings association has provided notice of the use of the model to the  appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1)  of this section or after the appropriate Federal banking agency has  approved the use of the model pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of  this section must be approved by the agency before a bank or savings  association may use the revised model for purposes of part 32.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basic Method. A national bank or savings association may  calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing transaction as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Repurchase agreement. The credit exposure arising from a  repurchase agreement shall equal and remain fixed at the market value at  execution of the transaction of the securities transferred to the other  party less cash received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Securities lending-- (1) Cash collateral transactions. The  credit exposure arising from a securities lending transaction where the  collateral is cash shall equal and remain fixed at the market value at  execution of the transaction of securities transferred less cash  received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-cash collateral transactions. The credit exposure arising  from a securities lending transaction where the collateral is other  securities shall   equal and remain fixed as the product of the higher of the two haircuts  associated with the two securities, as determined in Table 2 of this  section, and the higher of the two par values of the securities. Where  more than one security is provided as collateral, the applicable haircut  is the higher of the haircut associated with the security lent and the  notional-weighted average of the haircuts associated with the securities  provided as collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reverse repurchase agreements. The credit exposure arising from  a reverse repurchase agreement shall equal and remain fixed as the  product of the haircut associated with the collateral received, as  determined in Table 2 of this section, and the amount of cash  transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Securities borrowing-- (1) Cash collateral transactions. The  credit exposure arising from a securities borrowed transaction where the  collateral is cash shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the  haircut on the collateral received, as determined in Table 2 of this  section, and the amount of cash transferred to the other party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-cash collateral transactions. The credit exposure arising  from a securities borrowed transaction where the collateral is other  securities shall equal and remain fixed as the product of the higher of  the two haircuts associated with the two securities, as determined in  Table 2 of this section, and the higher of the two par values of the  securities. Where more than one security is provided as collateral, the  applicable haircut is the higher of the haircut associated with the  security borrowed and the notional-weighted average of the haircuts  associated with the securities provided as collateral.</p><p class="depth0">TABLE 2--Collateral Haircuts ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">SOVEREIGN ENTITIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Residual maturity     Haircut without</p><p class="depth0">currency mismatch</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ OECD Country Risk               < = 1 year...........             0.005.</p><p class="depth0">Classification \2\ 0-1.</p><p class="depth0">>1 year, <= 5 years..              0.02.</p><p class="depth0">>5 years.............              0.04.

A national bank or savings  association may calculate the credit exposure of a securities financing  transaction pursuant to 12 CFR 3.132(b)(2)(i) and (ii) or  324.132(b)(2)(i) and (ii), as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mandatory or alternative method. The appropriate Federal banking  agency may in its discretion require or permit a national bank or  savings association to use a specific method or methods set forth in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate the credit exposure  arising from all securities financing transactions or any specific, or  category of, securities financing transactions if the appropriate  Federal banking agency finds, in its discretion, that such method is  consistent with the safety and soundness of the bank or savings  association.  [77 FR 37280, June 21, 2012, as amended at 78 FR 37944, June 25, 2013;  79 FR 11312, Feb. 28, 2014]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 32--Interpretations  Section 1. Interrelation of General Limitation With Exception for Loans</p><p class="depth0">To Develop Domestic Residential Housing Units</p><p class="depth0">1. The Sec. 32.3(d)(2) exception for loans to one borrower to  develop domestic residential housing units is characterized in the  regulation as an ``alternative'' limit. This exceptional $30,000,000 or  30 percent limitation does not operate in addition to the 15 percent  General Limitation or the 10 percent additional amount a savings  association may loan to one borrower secured by readily marketable  collateral, but serves as the uppermost limitation on a savings  association's lending to any one person once a savings association  employs this exception.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Savings Association A's lending limitation as calculated  under the 15 percent General Limitation is $800, 000. If Savings  Association A lends Y $800,000 for commercial purposes, Savings  Association A cannot lend Y an additional $1,600,000, or 30 percent of  capital and surplus, to develop residential housing units under the  paragraph Sec. 32.3(d)(2) exception. The Sec. 32.3(d)(2) exception  operates as the uppermost limitation on all lending to one borrower (for  savings associations that may employ this exception) and includes any  amounts loaned to the same borrower under the General Limitation.  Savings Association A, therefore, may lend only an additional $800,000  to Y, provided Sec. 32.3(d)(2) prerequisites have been met. The amount  loaned under the authority of the General Limitation ($800,000), when  added to the amount loaned under the exception ($800,000), yields a sum  that does not exceed the 30 percent uppermost limitation ($1,600,000).</p><p class="depth0">2. a. This result does not change even if the facts are altered to  assume that some or all of the $800,000 amount of lending permissible  under the General Limitation's 15 percent basket is not used, or is  devoted to the development of domestic residential housing units.</p><p class="depth0">b. In other words, using the above example, if Savings Association A  lends Y $400,000 for commercial purposes and $300,000 for residential  purposes--both of which would be permitted under its $800,000 General  Limitation--Savings Association A's remaining permissible lending to Y  would be: first, an additional $100,000 under the General Limitation,  and then another $800,000 to develop domestic residential housing units  if the savings association meets the paragraph Sec. 32.3(d)(2)  prerequisites. (The latter is $800,000 because in no event may the total  lending to Y exceed 30 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired  surplus). If Savings Association A did not lend Y the remaining $100,000  permissible under the General Limitation, its permissible loans to  develop domestic residential housing units under Sec. 32.3(d)(2) would  be $900,000 instead of $800,000 (the total loans to Y would still equal  $1,600,000).</p><p class="depth0">3. In short, under the Sec. 32.3(d)(2) exception, the 30 percent or  $30,000,000 limit will always operate as the uppermost limitation,  unless the savings association does not avail itself of the exception  and merely relies upon its General Limitation.  Section 2. Interrelationship Between the General Limitation and the 150</p><p class="depth0">Percent Aggregate Limit on Loans to All Borrowers To Develop Domestic</p><p class="depth0">Residential Housing Units</p><p class="depth0">Numerous questions have been received regarding the allocation of  loans between the different lending limit ``baskets,'' i.e., the 15  percent General Limitation basket and the 30 percent Residential  Development basket. In general, the inquiries concern the manner in  which a savings association may ``move'' a loan from the General  Limitation basket to the Residential Development basket. The following  example is intended to provide guidance:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Savings Association A's General Limitation under  Sec. 32.3(a) is $15 million. In January, Savings Association A makes a  $10 million loan to Borrower to develop domestic residential housing  units. At the time the loan was made, Savings Association A had not  received approval under an order issued by the appropriate Federal  banking agency to avail itself of the residential development exception  to lending limits. Therefore, the $10 million loan is made under Savings  Association A's General Limitation.</p><p class="depth0">2. In June, Savings Association A receives authorization to lend  under the Residential Development exception. In July, Savings  Association A lends $3 million to Borrower to develop domestic  residential housing units. In August, Borrower seeks an additional $12  million commercial loan from Savings Association A. Savings Association  A cannot make the loan to Borrower, however, because it already has an  outstanding $10 million loan to Borrower that counts against Savings  Association A's General Limitation of $15 million. Thus, Savings  Association A may lend only up to an additional $5 million to Borrower  under the General Limitation.</p><p class="depth0">3. However, Savings Association A may be able to reallocate the $10  million loan it made to Borrower in January to its Residential  Development basket provided that: (1) Savings Association A has obtained  authority under an order issued by the appropriate Federal banking  agency to avail itself of the additional lending authority for  residential development and maintains compliance with all prerequisites  to such lending authority; (2) the original $10 million loan made in  January constitutes a loan to develop domestic residential housing units  as defined; and (3) the housing unit(s) constructed with the funds from  the January loan remain in a stage of ``development'' at the time  Savings Association A reallocates the loan to the domestic residential  housing basket. The project must be in a stage of acquisition,  development, construction, rehabilitation, or conversion in order for  the loan to be reallocated.</p><p class="depth0">4. If Savings Association A is able to reallocate the $10 million  loan made to Borrower in January to its Residential Development basket,  it may make the $12 million commercial loan requested by Borrower in  August. Once the January loan is reallocated to the Residential  Development basket, however, the $10 million loan counts towards Savings  Association A's 150 percent aggregate limitation on loans to all  borrowers under the residential development basket (Sec. 32.3(d)(2)).</p><p class="depth0">5. If Savings Association A reallocates the January loan to its  domestic residential housing basket and makes an additional $12 million  commercial loan to Borrower, Savings Association A's totals under the  respective limitations would be: $12 million under the General  Limitation; and $13 million under the Residential Development  limitation. The full $13 million residential development loan counts  toward Savings Association A's aggregate 150 percent limitation.  [77 FR 37282, June 21, 2012]</p>
