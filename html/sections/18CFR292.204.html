Facilities meeting the criteria in section 3(17)(E)  of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(17)(E)) have no maximum size,  and the power production capacity of such facilities shall be excluded  from consideration when determining the maximum size of other small  power production facilities within one mile of such facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fuel use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The primary energy source of the facility must  be biomass, waste, renewable resources, geothermal   resources, or any combination thereof, and 75 percent or more of the  total energy input must be from these sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any primary energy source which, on the basis of its energy  content, is 50 percent or more biomass shall be considered biomass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of oil, natural gas and coal by a facility, under section  3(17)(B) of the Federal Power Act, is limited to the minimum amounts of  fuel required for ignition, startup, testing, flame stabilization, and  control uses, and the minimum amounts of fuel required to alleviate or  prevent unanticipated equipment outages, and emergencies, directly  affecting the public health, safety, or welfare, which would result from  electric power outages. Such fuel use may not, in the aggregate, exceed  25 percent of the total energy input of the facility during the 12-month  period beginning with the date the facility first produces electric  energy and any calendar year subsequent to the year in which the  facility first produces electric energy.
