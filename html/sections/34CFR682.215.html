year the borrower certifies family size, if the children receive more than half their support from the borrower. A borrower's family size includes other individuals if, at the time the borrower certifies family size, the other individuals--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Live with the borrower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receive more than half their support from the borrower and will continue to receive this support from the borrower for the year the borrower certifies family size.

If a borrower is not a resident of a State identified in the poverty guidelines, the poverty guideline to be used for the borrower is the poverty guideline (for the relevant family size) used for the 48 contiguous States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Repayment plan. (1) A borrower may elect the income-based repayment plan only if the borrower has a partial financial hardship. The borrower's aggregate monthly loan payments are limited to no more than 15 percent of the amount by which the borrower's AGI exceeds 150 percent of the poverty line income applicable to the borrower's family size, divided by 12.

Each loan holder must apply the payment calculation rules in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section to loans they hold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a borrower elects the income-based repayment plan on or after July 1, 2013, the loan holder must, unless the borrower has some loans that are eligible for repayment under the income-based repayment plan and other loans that are not eligible for repayment under that plan, require that all eligible loans owed by the borrower to that holder be repaid under the income-based repayment plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the borrower's subsidized Stafford Loans or the subsidized portion of the borrower's Federal Consolidation loan, the Secretary pays to the holder the remaining accrued interest for a period not to exceed three consecutive years from the established repayment period start date on each loan repaid under the income-based repayment plan. On a Consolidation Loan that repays loans on which the Secretary has paid accrued interest under this section, the three-year period includes the period for which the Secretary paid accrued interest on the underlying loans. The three-year period does not include any period during which the borrower receives an economic hardship deferment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, accrued interest is capitalized at the time the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the borrower's monthly payment amount is not sufficient to pay any principal due, the payment of that principal is postponed until the borrower chooses to leave the income-based repayment plan or no longer has a partial financial hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The special allowance payment to a lender during the period in which the borrower has a partial financial hardship under the income-based repayment plan is calculated on the principal balance of the loan and any accrued interest unpaid by the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The repayment period for a borrower under the income-based repayment plan may be greater than 10 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment application and prepayment.
