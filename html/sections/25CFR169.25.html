                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act of March 11, 1904 (33 Stat. 65), as amended by the Act of March 2, 1917 (39 Stat. 973; 25 U.S.C. 321), authorizes right-of-way grants for oil and gas pipelines across tribal, individually owned and Government-owned land. Rights-of-way granted under that act shall be subject to the provisions of this section as well as other pertinent sections of this part 169. Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, rights-of-way granted for such purposes under the Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328) shall also be

subject to the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rights-of-way, granted under aforesaid Act of March 11, 1904, as amended, for oil and gas pipelines, pumping stations or tank sites shall not extend beyond a term of 20 years and may be extended for another period of not to exceed 20 years following the procedures set out in Sec. 169.19 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All oil or gas pipelines, including connecting lines, shall be buried a sufficient depth below the surface of the land so as not to interfere with cultivation. Whenever the line is laid under a road or highway, the right-of-way for which has been granted under an approved application pursuant to an act of Congress, its construction shall be in compliance with the applicable Federal and State laws; during the period of construction, at least one-half the width of the road shall be kept open to travel; and, upon completion, the road or highway shall be restored to its original condition and all excavations shall be refilled. Whenever the line crosses a ravine, canyon, or waterway, it shall be laid below the bed thereof or upon such superstructure as will not interfere with the use of the surface.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The size of the proposed pipeline must be shown in the application, on the maps, and in the engineer's affidavit and applicant's certificate. The application and maps shall specify whether the pipe is welded, screw-joint, dresser, or other type of coupling. Should the grantee of an approved right-of-way desire at any time to lay additional line or lines of pipe in the same trench, or to replace the original line with larger or smaller pipe, written permission must first be obtained from the Secretary and all damages to be sustained by the owners must be paid in advance in the amount fixed and determined by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicants for oil or gas pipeline rights-of-way may apply for additional land for pumping stations or tank sites. The maps shall show clearly the location of all structures and the location of all lines connecting with the main line. Applicants for lands for pumping stations or tank sites shall execute and file a stipulation agreeing as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon abandonment of the right-of-way to level all dikes, fire-guards, and excavations and to remove all concrete masonry foundations, bases, and structural works and to restore the land as nearly as may be possible to its original condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That a grant for pumping station or tank site purposes shall be subservient to the owner's right to remove or authorize the removal of oil, gas, or other mineral deposits; and that the structures for pumping station or tank site will be removed or relocated if necessary to avoid interference with the exploration for or recovery of oil, gas, or other minerals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Purely lateral lines connecting with oil or gas wells on restricted lands may be constructed upon filing with the Secretary a copy of the written consent of the Indian owners and a blueprint copy of a map showing the location of the lateral. Such lateral lines may be of any diameter or length, but must be limited to those used solely for the transportation of oil or gas from a single tract of tribal or individually owned land to another lateral or to a branch of the main line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The applicant, by accepting a pipeline right-of-way, thereby agrees that the books and records of the applicant shall be open to inspection by the Secretary at all reasonable times, in order to obtain information pertaining in any way to oil or gas produced from tribal or individually owned lands or other lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>
