                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags)  which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in  countries other than the United States may be authorized either (1)  through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation  by an approved method in that part of the United States within the  generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a  northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum  fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the  covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization.  When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant  in California for utilization, or from a California port to another  California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for  movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made  by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20  pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved  overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is  not available. Such overland movement may be made   only after approved surface treatment or under such other conditions as  may be deemed necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such  covers arrive at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican  border port they will be required to be transported therefrom  immediately in bond by an all-water route to a northern or California  port where approved vacuum fumigation facilities are available for  vacuum fumigation thereat by an approved method or for forwarding  therefrom to an approved mill or plant for utilization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which  has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United  States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon  compliance with Sec. Sec. 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or  other treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics  when attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the  judgment of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live  pink bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been  used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as  containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate  treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector  may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be  effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and  subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by  the inspector pursuant to Sec. 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in  regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the  place of treatment: Provided, That such covers may be authorized entry  from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the  covers are found to be contaminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been  used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so  processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that  have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during  the process of screening, and which arrive from a country named in Sec.  319.59-2(a)(2) of this part, if intended for reuse in this country as  grain containers may be authorized entry, subject to immediate treatment  at the port of arrival. If such covers are not intended to be reused in  this country as grain containers their entry may be authorized subject  to movement for utilization to an approved mill or plant the owner or  operator of which has executed an appropriate agreement with the Plant  Protection and Quarantine Programs similar to that described in Sec.  319.8-8(a)(2). Covers coming within this paragraph only, may be entered  without permit other than the authorization provided in this paragraph  and without other restriction under this subpart upon presentation to an  inspector of satisfactory evidence that they have been used only for  grains exported from the United States and are being returned empty  without use abroad and that while abroad they have been handled in a  manner to prevent their contamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit  bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more  bales containing material the importation of which is regulated by  paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any  portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as  specified in the applicable paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified  by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this  section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such  requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem  necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect  pests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this  section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags,  and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon  compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the  inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that  would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is  otherwise no   plant pest risk associated with their entry.
