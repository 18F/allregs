                            <p class="depth0">When a port director makes a preliminary determination that a new CES should be established, or when the term of an existing CES is about to expire and the port director believes that the need for a CES still exists, he will announce, by written notice posted at the customhouse and by any other written methods he may consider appropriate (such as normal port information distribution channels, trade bulletins or local newspapers), that applications to operate a CES are being accepted. This notice will include the general criteria together with any local criteria that applicants must meet (see Sec. 118.11 of this part), and will invite the public to submit any relevant written comments on whether a new CES should be established or on whether there is still a need for a CES. Applications will be accepted only in response to the port notice and must be received within 60 calendar days from the date of the notice. Public comments must be received within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice.</p>
