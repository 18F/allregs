                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Protection for floor openings. (1) Every stairway floor opening shall be guarded by a standard railing constructed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The railing shall be provided on all exposed sides (except at entrance to stairway). For infrequently used stairways where traffic across the opening prevents the use of fixed standard railing (as when located in aisle spaces, etc.), the guard shall consist of a hinged floor opening cover of standard strength and construction and removable standard railings on all exposed sides (except at entrance to stairway).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every ladderway floor opening or platform shall be guarded by a standard railing with standard toeboard on all exposed sides (except at entrance to opening), with the passage through the railing either provided with a swinging gate or so offset that a person cannot walk directly into the opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Every hatchway and chute floor opening shall be guarded by one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hinged floor opening cover of standard strength and construction equipped with standard railings or permanently attached thereto so as to leave only one exposed side. When the opening is not in use, the cover shall be closed or the exposed side shall be guarded at both top and intermediate positions by removable standard railings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A removable railing with toeboard on not more than two sides of the opening and fixed standard railings with toeboards on all other exposed sides. The removable railings shall be kept in place when the opening is not in use.




Where operating conditions necessitate the feeding of material into any hatchway or chute opening, protection shall be provided to prevent a person from falling through the opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Every skylight floor opening and hole shall be guarded by a standard skylight screen or a fixed standard railing on all exposed sides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Every pit and trapdoor floor opening, infrequently used, shall be guarded by a floor opening cover of standard strength and construction. While the cover is not in place, the pit or trap opening shall be constantly attended by someone or shall be protected on all exposed sides by removable standard railings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Every manhole floor opening shall be guarded by a standard manhole cover which need not be hinged in place. While the cover is not in place, the manhole opening shall be constantly attended by someone or shall be protected by removable standard railings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Every temporary floor opening shall have standard railings, or shall be constantly attended by someone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Every floor hole into which persons can accidentally walk shall be guarded by either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A standard railing with standard toeboard on all exposed sides, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A floor hole cover of standard strength and construction. While the cover is not in place, the floor hole shall be constantly attended by someone or shall be protected by a removable standard railing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Every floor hole into which persons cannot accidentally walk (on account of fixed machinery, equipment, or walls) shall be protected by a cover that leaves no openings more than 1 inch wide. The cover shall be securely held in place to prevent tools or materials from falling through.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Where doors or gates open directly on a stairway, a platform shall be provided, and the swing of the door shall not reduce the effective width to less than 20 inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Protection for wall openings and holes. (1) Every wall opening from which there is a drop of more than 4 feet shall be guarded by one of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rail, roller, picket fence, half door, or equivalent barrier. Where there is exposure below to falling materials, a removable toe board or the equivalent shall also be provided. When the opening is not in use for handling materials, the guard shall be kept in position regardless of a door on the opening. In addition, a grab handle shall be provided on each side of the opening with its center approximately 4 feet above floor level and of standard strength and mounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extension platform onto which materials can be hoisted for handling, and which shall have side rails or equivalent guards of standard specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every chute wall opening from which there is a drop of more than 4 feet shall be guarded by one or more of the barriers specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or as required by the conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Every window wall opening at a stairway landing, floor, platform, or balcony, from which there is a drop of more than 4 feet, and where the bottom of the opening is less than 3 feet above the platform or landing, shall be guarded by standard slats, standard grill work (as specified in paragraph (e)(11) of this section), or standard railing.

Where the window opening is below the landing, or platform, a standard toe board shall be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Every temporary wall opening shall have adequate guards but these need not be of standard construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where there is a hazard of materials falling through a wall hole, and the lower edge of the near side of the hole is less than 4 inches above the floor, and the far side of the hole more than 5 feet above the next lower level, the hole shall be protected by a standard toeboard, or an enclosing screen either of solid construction, or as specified in paragraph (e)(11) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protection of open-sided floors, platforms, and runways. (1) Every open-sided floor or platform 4 feet or more above adjacent floor or ground level shall be guarded by a standard railing (or the equivalent as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) on all open sides except where there is entrance to a ramp, stairway, or fixed ladder. The railing shall be provided with a

toeboard wherever, beneath the open sides,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Persons can pass,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is moving machinery, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is equipment with which falling materials could create a hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Every runway shall be guarded by a standard railing (or the equivalent as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) on all open sides 4 feet or more above floor or ground level. Wherever tools, machine parts, or materials are likely to be used on the runway, a toeboard shall also be provided on each exposed side.
Runways used exclusively for special purposes (such as oiling, shafting, or filling tank cars) may have the railing on one side omitted where operating conditions necessitate such omission, providing the falling hazard is minimized by using a runway of not less than 18 inches wide. Where persons entering upon runways become thereby exposed to machinery, electrical equipment, or other danger not a falling hazard, additional guarding than is here specified may be essential for protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Regardless of height, open-sided floors, walkways, platforms, or runways above or adjacent to dangerous equipment, pickling or galvanizing tanks, degreasing units, and similar hazards shall be guarded with a standard railing and toe board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Stairway railings and guards. (1) Every flight of stairs having four or more risers shall be equipped with standard stair railings or standard handrails as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (v) of this section, the width of the stair to be measured clear of all obstructions except handrails:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On stairways less than 44 inches wide having both sides enclosed, at least one handrail, preferably on the right side descending.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On stairways less than 44 inches wide having one side open, at least one stair railing on open side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On stairways less than 44 inches wide having both sides open, one stair railing on each side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On stairways more than 44 inches wide but less than 88 inches wide, one handrail on each enclosed side and one stair railing on each open side.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> On stairways 88 or more inches wide, one handrail on each enclosed side, one stair railing on each open side, and one intermediate stair railing located approximately midway of the width.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Winding stairs shall be equipped with a handrail offset to prevent walking on all portions of the treads having width less than 6 inches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Railing, toe boards, and cover specifications. (1) A standard railing shall consist of top rail, intermediate rail, and posts, and shall have a vertical height of 42 inches nominal from upper surface of top rail to floor, platform, runway, or ramp level. The top rail shall be smooth-surfaced throughout the length of the railing. The intermediate rail shall be approximately halfway between the top rail and the floor, platform, runway, or ramp. The ends of the rails shall not overhang the terminal posts except where such overhang does not constitute a projection hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A stair railing shall be of construction similar to a standard railing but the vertical height shall be not more than 34 inches nor less than 30 inches from upper surface of top rail to surface of tread in line with face of riser at forward edge of tread.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For wood railings, the posts shall be of at least 2-inch by 4-inch stock spaced not to exceed 6 feet; the top and intermediate rails shall be of at least 2-inch by 4-inch stock.
