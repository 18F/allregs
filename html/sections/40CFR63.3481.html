                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the source category to which this subpart applies is surface coating of metal cans and ends (including decorative tins) and metal crowns and closures. It includes the subcategories listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. Surface coating is the application of coatings to a substrate using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One- and two-piece draw and iron can body coating. The one- and two-piece draw and iron can body coating subcategory includes all coating processes involved in the manufacture of can bodies by the draw and iron process. This subcategory includes three distinct coating type segments reflecting the coatings appropriate for cans with different end uses. Those are two-piece beverage can body coatings, two-piece food can body coatings, and one-piece aerosol can body coatings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sheetcoating. The sheetcoating subcategory includes all of the flat metal sheetcoating operations associated with the manufacture of three-piece cans, decorative tins, crowns, and closures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Three-piece can body assembly coating. The three-piece can body assembly coating subcategory includes all of the coating processes involved in the assembly of three-piece metal can bodies. The subcategory includes five distinct coating type segments reflecting the coatings appropriate for cans with different end uses. Those are inside spray on food cans, aseptic side seam stripes on food cans, nonaseptic side seam stripes on food cans, side seam stripes on general line nonfood cans, and side seam stripes on aerosol nonfood cans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> End coating. The end coating subcategory includes the application of end seal compounds and repair spray coatings to metal can ends. This subcategory includes three distinct coating type segments reflecting the end seal compounds and repair sprays appropriate for can ends with different end uses. Those are aseptic end seal

compounds, nonaseptic end seal compounds, and repair spray coatings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in Sec. 63.3482, that uses 5,700 liters (1,500 gallons (gal)) per year, or more, of coatings in the source category defined in paragraph (a) of this section and that is a major source, is located at a major source, or is part of a major source of emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart does not apply to surface coating that meets the criteria of paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface coating conducted at a source that uses only coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials that contain no organic HAP, as determined according to Sec. 63.3521(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface coating subject to any other NESHAP in this part as of November 13, 2003.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surface coating and cleaning activities that use research or laboratory equipment or that are part of janitorial, building, and facility maintenance operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Surface coating of continuous metal coil that may subsequently be used in manufacturing cans. Subpart SSSS of this part covers surface coating performed on a continuous metal coil substrate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Surface coating of metal pails, buckets, and drums. Future subpart MMMM of this part will cover surface coating of all miscellaneous metal parts and products not explicitly covered by another subpart.
