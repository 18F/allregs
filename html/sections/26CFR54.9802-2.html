                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exception for certain church plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Church plans in general.  A church plan described in paragraph (b) of this section is not treated  as failing to meet the requirements of section 9802 or Sec. 54.9802-1  solely because the plan requires evidence of good health for coverage of  individuals under plan provisions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Health insurance issuers. See sections 2702 and 2721(b)(1)(B) of  the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-2 and 300gg-21(b)(1)(B))  and 45 CFR 146.121, which require health insurance issuers providing  health insurance coverage under a church plan that is a group health  plan to comply with nondiscrimination requirements similar to those that  church plans are required to comply with under section 9802 and Sec.  54.9802-1 except that those nondiscrimination requirements do not  include an exception for health insurance issuers comparable to the  exception for church plans under section 9802(c) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Church plans to which this section applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Church plans  with certain coverage provisions in effect on July 15, 1997. This  section applies to any church plan (as defined in section 414(e)) for a  plan year if, on July 15, 1997 and at all times thereafter before the  beginning of the plan year, the plan contains either the provisions  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or the provisions  described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan provisions applicable to individuals employed by employers  of 10 or fewer employees and self-employed individuals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan  contains the provisions described in this paragraph (b)(2) if it  requires evidence of good health of both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any employee of an employer of 10 or fewer employees (determined  without regard to section 414(e)(3)(C), under which a church or  convention or association of churches is treated as the employer); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any self-employed individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A plan does not contain the provisions described in this  paragraph (b)(2) if the plan contains only one of the provisions  described in this paragraph (b)(2). Thus, for example, a plan that  requires evidence of good health of any self-employed individual, but  not of any employee of an employer with 10 or fewer employees, does not  contain the provisions described in this paragraph (b)(2). Moreover, a  plan does not contain the provision described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)  of this section if the plan requires evidence of good health of any  employee of an employer of fewer than 10 (or greater than 10) employees.  Thus, for example, a plan does not contain the provision described in  paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section if the plan requires evidence of  good health of any employee of an employer with five or fewer employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan provisions applicable to individuals who enroll after the  first 90 days of initial eligibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan contains the provisions  described in this paragraph (b)(3) if it requires evidence of good  health of any individual who enrolls after the first 90 days of initial  eligibility under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A plan does not contain the provisions described in this  paragraph (b)(3) if it provides for a longer (or shorter) period than 90  days. Thus, for example, a plan requiring evidence of good health of any  individual who enrolls after the first 120 days of initial eligibility  under the plan does not contain the provisions described in this  paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A church organization maintains two church  plans for entities affiliated with the church. One plan is a group  health plan that provides health coverage to all employees (including  ministers and lay workers) of any affiliated church entity that has more  than 10 employees. The other plan is Plan O, which is a group health  plan that is not funded through insurance coverage and that provides  health coverage to any employee (including ministers and lay workers) of  any affiliated church entity that has 10 or fewer employees and any  self-employed individual affiliated with the church (including a self- employed minister of the church). Plan O requires evidence of good  health in order for any individual of a church entity that has 10 or  fewer employees to be covered and in order for any self-employed  individual to be covered. On July 15, 1997 and at all times thereafter  before the beginning of the plan year, Plan O has contained all the  preceding provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, because Plan O contains the plan  provisions described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and because  those provisions were in the plan on July 15, 1997 and at all times  thereafter before the beginning of the plan year, Plan O will not be  treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 9802 or Sec.  54.9802-1 for the plan year solely because the plan requires evidence of  good health for coverage of the individuals described in those plan  provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A church organization maintains Plan P, which  is a church plan that is not funded through insurance coverage and that  is a group health plan providing health coverage to individuals employed  by entities affiliated with the church and self-employed individuals  affiliated with the church (such as ministers). On July 15, 1997 and at  all times thereafter before the beginning of the plan year, Plan P has  required evidence of good health for coverage of any individual who  enrolls after the first 90 days of initial eligibility under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, because Plan P contains the plan  provisions described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and because  those provisions were in the plan on July 15, 1997 and at all times  thereafter before the beginning of the plan year, Plan P will not be  treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 9802 or Sec.  54.9802-1 for the plan year solely because the plan requires evidence of  good health for coverage of individuals enrolling after the first 90  days of initial eligibility under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Applicability date. This section is applicable to plan years  beginning on or after July 1, 2007.  [T.D. 9299, 71 FR 75056, Dec. 13, 2006]    Sec. 54.9802-3T  Additional requirements prohibiting discrimination  based on genetic information (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> govern in applying the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Collect means, with respect to information, to request, require,  or purchase such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Family member means, with respect to an individual --</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A dependent (as defined for purposes of Sec. 54.9801-2) of the  individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other person who is a first-degree, second-degree, third- degree, or fourth-degree relative of the individual or of a dependent of  the individual. Relatives by affinity (such as by marriage or adoption)  are treated the same as relatives by consanguinity (that is, relatives  who share a common biological ancestor). In determining the degree of  the relationship, relatives by less than full consanguinity (such as  half-siblings, who share only one parent) are treated the same as  relatives by full consanguinity (such as siblings who share both  parents).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First-degree relatives include parents, spouses, siblings, and  children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Second-degree relatives include grandparents, grandchildren,  aunts, uncles, nephews, and nieces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Third-degree relatives include great-grandparents, great- grandchildren, great aunts, great uncles, and first cousins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fourth-degree relatives include great-great grandparents, great- great grandchildren, and children of first cousins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Genetic information means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subject to paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this  section, with respect to an individual, information about--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual's genetic tests (as defined in paragraph (a)(5)  of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The genetic tests of family members of the individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manifestation (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this  section) of a disease or disorder in family members of the individual;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any request for, or receipt of, genetic services (as defined in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section), or participation   in clinical research which includes genetic services, by the individual  or any family member of the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term genetic information does not include information about  the sex or age of any individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term genetic information includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With respect to a pregnant woman (or a family member of the  pregnant woman), genetic information of any fetus carried by the  pregnant woman; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to an individual (or a family member of the  individual) who is utilizing an assisted reproductive technology,  genetic information of any embryo legally held by the individual or  family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Genetic services means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A genetic test, as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Genetic counseling (including obtaining, interpreting, or  assessing genetic information); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Genetic education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Genetic test means an analysis of human DNA, RNA,  chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites, if the analysis detects  genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes. However, a genetic test  does not include an analysis of proteins or metabolites that is directly  related to a manifested disease, disorder, or pathological condition.  Accordingly, a test to determine whether an individual has a BRCA1 or  BRCA2 variant is a genetic test. Similarly, a test to determine whether  an individual has a genetic variant associated with hereditary  nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is a genetic test. However, an HIV test,  complete blood count, cholesterol test, liver function test, or test for  the presence of alcohol or drugs is not a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of this paragraph (a)(5) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A is a newborn covered under a group  health plan. A undergoes a phenylketonuria (PKU) screening, which  measures the concentration of a metabolite, phenylalanine, in A's blood.  In PKU, a mutation occurs in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene  which contains instructions for making the enzyme needed to break down  the amino acid phenylalanine. Individuals with the mutation, who have a  deficiency in the enzyme to break down phenylalanine, have high  concentrations of phenylalanine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example, the PKU screening is a genetic  test with respect to A because the screening is an analysis of  metabolites that detects a genetic mutation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manifestation or manifested means, with respect to a disease,  disorder, or pathological condition, that an individual has been or  could reasonably be diagnosed with the disease, disorder, or  pathological condition by a health care professional with appropriate  training and expertise in the field of medicine involved. For purposes  of this section, a disease, disorder, or pathological condition is not  manifested if a diagnosis is based principally on genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rules of this paragraph (a)(6) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A has a family medical history of  diabetes. A begins to experience excessive sweating, thirst, and  fatigue. A's physician examines A and orders blood glucose testing  (which is not a genetic test). Based on the physician's examination, A's  symptoms, and test results that show elevated levels of blood glucose,  A's physician diagnoses A as having adult onset diabetes mellitus (Type  2 diabetes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, A has been diagnosed by a health  care professional with appropriate training and expertise in the field  of medicine involved. The diagnosis is not based principally on genetic  information. Thus, Type 2 diabetes is manifested with respect to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B has several family members with  colon cancer. One of them underwent genetic testing which detected a  mutation in the MSH2 gene associated with hereditary nonpolyposis  colorectal cancer (HNPCC). B's physician, a health care professional  with appropriate training and expertise in the field of medicine  involved, recommends that B undergo a targeted genetic test to look for  the specific mutation found in B's relative to determine if B has an  elevated risk for cancer. The genetic test with respect to B showed that  B also carries the mutation and is at increased risk to develop  colorectal and other cancers associated with HNPCC. B has a colonoscopy  which indicates no signs of disease, and B has no symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, because B has no signs or  symptoms of colorectal cancer, B has not been and could not reasonably  be diagnosed with HNPCC. Thus, HNPCC is not manifested with respect to  B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 2, except that B's  colonoscopy and subsequent tests indicate the presence of HNPCC. Based  on the colonoscopy and subsequent test results, B's physician makes a  diagnosis of HNPCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, HNPCC is manifested with respect  to B because a health care professional with appropriate training and  expertise in the field of medicine involved has made a diagnosis that is  not based principally on genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual C has a family member that has been  diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. A genetic test indicates that C has  the Huntington's Disease gene variant. At age 42, C begins suffering  from occasional moodiness and disorientation, symptoms which are  associated with Huntington's Disease. C is examined by a neurologist (a  physician with appropriate training and expertise for diagnosing  Huntington's Disease). The examination includes a clinical neurological  exam. The results of the examination do not support a diagnosis of  Huntington's Disease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, C is not and could not  reasonably be diagnosed with Huntington's Disease by a health care  professional with appropriate training and expertise. Therefore,  Huntington's Disease is not manifested with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except that C  exhibits additional neurological and behavioral symptoms, and the  results of the examination support a diagnosis of Huntington's Disease  with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, C could reasonably be diagnosed  with Huntington's Disease by a health care professional with appropriate  training and expertise. Therefore, Huntington's Disease is manifested  with respect to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Underwriting purposes has the meaning given in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No group-based discrimination based on genetic information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general. For purposes of this section, a group health plan must not  adjust premium or contribution amounts for any employer, or any group of  similarly situated individuals under the plan, on the basis of genetic  information. For this purpose, ``similarly situated individuals'' are  those described in Sec. 54.9802-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section) limits the  ability of a group health plan to increase the premium for an employer  or for a group of similarly situated individuals under the plan based on  the manifestation of a disease or disorder of an individual who is  enrolled in the plan. In such a case, however, the manifestation of a  disease or disorder in one individual cannot also be used as genetic  information about other group members to further increase the premium  for an employer or a group of similarly situated individuals under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that  provides coverage through a health insurance issuer. In order to  determine the premium rate for the upcoming plan year, the issuer  reviews the claims experience of individuals covered under the plan and  other health status information of the individuals, including genetic  information. The issuer finds that three individuals covered under the  plan had unusually high claims experience. In addition, the issuer finds  that the genetic information of two other individuals indicates the  individuals have a higher probability of developing certain illnesses  although the illnesses are not manifested at this time. The issuer  quotes the plan a higher per-participant rate because of both the  genetic information and the higher claims experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. See Example 1 in 29 CFR 2590.702-1(b)(3) or 45 CFR  146.122(b)(3) for a conclusion that the issuer violates the provisions  of 29 CFR 2590.702-1(b) or 45 CFR 146.122(b) similar to the requirements  of this paragraph (b) because the issuer adjusts the premium based on  genetic information. However, if the adjustment related solely to claims  experience, the adjustment would not violate the requirements of 29 CFR  2590.702-1 or 45 CFR 146.122 similar to the requirements of this section  (nor would it violate the requirements of paragraph (c) of 29 CFR  2590.702 or 45 CFR 146.121 similar to the requirements of paragraph (c)  of Sec. 54.9802-1, which prohibits discrimination in individual  premiums or contributions based on a health factor but permits increases  in the group rate based on a health factor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer sponsors a group health plan that  provides coverage through a health insurance issuer. In order to  determine the premium rate for the upcoming plan year, the issuer  reviews the claims experience of individuals covered under the plan and  other health status information of the individuals, including genetic  information. The issuer finds that Employee A has made claims for  treatment of polycystic kidney disease. A also has two dependent  children covered under the plan. The   issuer quotes the plan a higher per-participant rate because of both A's  claims experience and the family medical history of A's children (that  is, the fact that A has the disease).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. See Example 2 in 29 CFR 2590.702-1(b)(3) or 45 CFR  146.122(b)(3) for a conclusion that the issuer violates the provisions  of 29 CFR 2590.702-1(b) or 45 CFR 146.122(b) similar to the requirements  of this paragraph (b) because, by taking the likelihood that A's  children may develop polycystic kidney disease into account in computing  the rate for the plan, the issuer adjusts the premium based on genetic  information relating to a condition that has not been manifested in A's  children. However, the issuer does not violate the requirements of 29  CFR 2590.702-1(b) or 45 CFR 146.122(b) similar to the requirements of  this paragraph (b) by increasing the premium based on A's claims  experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on requesting or requiring genetic testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a  group health plan must not request or require an individual or a family  member of the individual to undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Health care professional may recommend a genetic test. Nothing  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section limits the authority of a health  care professional who is providing health care services to an individual  to request that the individual undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this  section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A goes to a physician for a routine  physical examination. The physician reviews A's family medical history  and A informs the physician that A's mother has been diagnosed with  Huntington's Disease. The physician advises A that Huntington's Disease  is hereditary and recommends that A undergo a genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the physician is a health care  professional who is providing health care services to A. Therefore, the  physician's recommendation that A undergo the genetic test does not  violate this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B is covered by a health  maintenance organization (HMO). B is a child being treated for leukemia.  B's physician, who is employed by the HMO, is considering a treatment  plan that includes six-mercaptopurine, a drug for treating leukemia in  most children. However, the drug could be fatal if taken by a small  percentage of children with a particular gene variant. B's physician  recommends that B undergo a genetic test to detect this variant before  proceeding with this course of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, even though the physician is  employed by the HMO, the physician is nonetheless a health care  professional who is providing health care services to B. Therefore, the  physician's recommendation that B undergo the genetic test does not  violate this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination regarding payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. As provided in  this paragraph (c)(4), nothing in paragraph (c)(1) of this section  precludes a plan from obtaining and using the results of a genetic test  in making a determination regarding payment. For this purpose,  ``payment'' has the meaning given such term in 45 CFR 164.501 of the  privacy regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act. Thus, if a plan conditions payment for an item or  service based on its medical appropriateness and the medical  appropriateness of the item or service depends on the genetic makeup of  a patient, then the plan is permitted to condition payment for the item  or service on the outcome of a genetic test. The plan may also refuse  payment if the patient does not undergo the genetic test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation. A plan is permitted to request only the minimum  amount of information necessary to make a determination regarding  payment. The minimum amount of information necessary is determined in  accordance with the minimum necessary standard in 45 CFR 164.502(b) of  the privacy regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. See paragraph (e) of this section for examples  illustrating the rules of this paragraph (c)(4), as well as other  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Research in accordance with Federal regulations and applicable  State or local law or regulations. The plan makes the request pursuant  to research, as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(d), that complies with 45 CFR  Part 46 or equivalent Federal regulations, and any applicable State or  local law or regulations for   the protection of human subjects in research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Written request for participation in research. The plan makes  the request in writing, and the request clearly indicates to each  participant or beneficiary (or, in the case of a minor child, to the  legal guardian of the beneficiary) that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Compliance with the request is voluntary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Noncompliance will have no effect on eligibility for benefits  (as described in Sec. 54.9802-1(b)(1)) or premium or contribution  amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prohibition on underwriting. No genetic information collected  or acquired under this paragraph (c)(5) can be used for underwriting  purposes (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Notice to Federal agencies. The plan completes a copy of the  ``Notice of Research Exception under the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act'' authorized by the Secretary and provides the  notice to the address specified in the instructions thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibitions on collection of genetic information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For  underwriting purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A group health plan must not  collect (as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) genetic  information for underwriting purposes. See paragraph (e) of this section  for examples illustrating the rules of this paragraph (d)(1), as well as  other provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Underwriting purposes defined. Subject to paragraph (d)(1)(iii)  of this section, underwriting purposes means, with respect to any group  health plan, or health insurance coverage offered in connection with a  group health plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rules for, or determination of, eligibility (including  enrollment and continued eligibility) for benefits under the plan or  coverage as described in Sec. 54.9802-1(b)(1)(ii) (including changes in  deductibles or other cost-sharing mechanisms in return for activities  such as completing a health risk assessment or participating in a  wellness program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The computation of premium or contribution amounts under the  plan or coverage (including discounts, rebates, payments in kind, or  other premium differential mechanisms in return for activities such as  completing a health risk assessment or participating in a wellness  program);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The application of any preexisting condition exclusion under the  plan or coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other activities related to the creation, renewal, or  replacement of a contract of health insurance or health benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, as well as other provisions of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior to or in connection with enrollment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  group health plan must not collect genetic information with respect to  any individual prior to that individual's effective date of coverage  under that plan, nor in connection with the rules for eligibility (as  defined in Sec. 54.9802-1(b)(1)(ii)) that apply to that individual.  Whether or not an individual's information is collected prior to that  individual's effective date of coverage is determined at the time of  collection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incidental collection exception--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a group  health plan obtains genetic information incidental to   the collection of other information concerning any individual, the  collection is not a violation of this paragraph (d)(2), as long as the  collection is not for underwriting purposes in violation of paragraph  (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitation. The incidental collection exception of this  paragraph (d)(2)(ii) does not apply in connection with any collection  where it is reasonable to anticipate that health information will be  received, unless the collection explicitly states that genetic  information should not be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan provides a premium  reduction to enrollees who complete a health risk assessment. The health  risk assessment is requested to be completed after enrollment. Whether  or not it is completed or what responses are given on it has no effect  on an individual's enrollment status, or on the enrollment status of  members of the individual's family. The health risk assessment includes  questions about the individual's family medical history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, the health risk assessment  includes a request for genetic information (that is, the individual's  family medical history). Because completing the health risk assessment  results in a premium reduction, the request for genetic information is  for underwriting purposes. Consequently, the request violates the  prohibition on the collection of genetic information in paragraph (d)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The same facts as Example 1, except there is  no premium reduction or any other reward for completing the health risk  assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the request is not for  underwriting purposes, nor is it prior to or in connection with  enrollment. Therefore, it does not violate the prohibition on the  collection of genetic information in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requests that enrollees  complete a health risk assessment prior to enrollment, and includes  questions about the individual's family medical history. There is no  reward or penalty for completing the health risk assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  there is no premium reduction or any other reward given for completion  of the health risk assessment. However, certain people completing the  health risk assessment may become eligible for additional benefits under  the plan by being enrolled in a disease management program based on  their answers to questions about family medical history. Other people  may become eligible for the disease management program based solely on  their answers to questions about their individual medical history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the request for information  about an individual's family medical history could result in the  individual being eligible for benefits for which the individual would  not otherwise be eligible. Therefore, the questions about family medical  history on the health risk assessment are a request for genetic  information for underwriting purposes and are prohibited under this  paragraph (d). Although the plan conditions eligibility for the disease  management program based on determinations of medical appropriateness,  the exception for determinations of medical appropriateness does not  apply because the individual is not seeking benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan requests enrollees to  complete two distinct health risk assessments (HRAs) after and unrelated  to enrollment. The first HRA instructs the individual to answer only for  the individual and not for the individual's family. The first HRA does  not ask about any genetic tests the individual has undergone or any  genetic services the individual has received. The plan offers a reward  for completing the first HRA. The second HRA asks about family medical  history and the results of genetic tests the individual has undergone.  The plan offers no reward for completing the second HRA and the  instructions make clear that completion of the second HRA is wholly  voluntary and will not affect the reward given for completion of the  first HRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, no genetic information is  collected in connection with the first HRA, which offers a reward, and  no benefits or other rewards are conditioned on the request for genetic  information in the second HRA. Consequently, the request for genetic  information in the second HRA is not for underwriting purposes, and the  two HRAs do not violate the prohibition on the collection of genetic  information in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan waives its annual  deductible for enrollees who complete an HRA. The HRA is requested to be  completed after enrollment. Whether   or not the HRA is completed or what responses are given on it has no  effect on an individual's enrollment status, or on the enrollment status  of members of the individual's family. The HRA does not include any  direct questions about the individual's genetic information (including  family medical history). However, the last question reads, ``Is there  anything else relevant to your health that you would like us to know or  discuss with you?''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, the plan's request for medical  information does not explicitly state that genetic information should  not be provided. Therefore, any genetic information collected in  response to the question is not within the incidental collection  exception and is prohibited under this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 6, except that the last  question goes on to state, ``In answering this question, you should not  include any genetic information. That is, please do not include any  family medical history or any information related to genetic testing,  genetic services, genetic counseling, or genetic diseases for which you  believe you may be at risk.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 7, the plan's request for medical  information explicitly states that genetic information should not be  provided. Therefore, any genetic information collected in response to  the question is within the incidental collection exception. However, the  plan may not use any genetic information it obtains incidentally for  underwriting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Issuer M acquires Issuer N. M requests N's  records, stating that N should not provide genetic information and  should review the records to excise any genetic information. N assembles  the data requested by M and, although N reviews it to delete genetic  information, the data from a specific region included some individuals'  family medical history. Consequently, M receives genetic information  about some of N's covered individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. See Example 8 in 29  CFR 2590.702-1(d)(3) or 45 CFR 146.122(d)(3) also for a caveat that M  may not use the genetic information it obtained incidentally for  underwriting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples regarding determinations of medical appropriateness.  The application of the rules of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section  to plan determinations of medical appropriateness is illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A's group health plan covers  genetic testing for celiac disease for individuals who have family  members with this condition. After A's son is diagnosed with celiac  disease, A undergoes a genetic test and promptly submits a claim for the  test to A's issuer for reimbursement. The issuer asks A to provide the  results of the genetic test before the claim is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. See Example 1 in 29 CFR 2590.702-1(e) or 45 CFR  146.122(e) for a conclusion under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of 29  CFR 2590.702-1 or 45 CFR 146.122 similar to the rules of paragraph  (c)(4) of this section that the issuer is permitted to request only the  minimum amount of information necessary to make a decision regarding  payment. Because the results of the test are not necessary for the  issuer to make a decision regarding the payment of A's claim, the  conclusion in Example 1 in 29 CFR 2590.702-1(e) or 45 CFR 146.122(e)  concludes that the issuer's request for the results of the genetic test  violates paragraph (c) of 29 CFR 2590.702-1 or 45 CFR 146.122 similar to  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual B's group health plan covers a  yearly mammogram for participants and beneficiaries starting at age 40,  or at age 30 for those with increased risk for breast cancer, including  individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. B is 33 years old and  has the BRCA2 mutation. B undergoes a mammogram and promptly submits a  claim to B's plan for reimbursement. Following an established policy,  the plan asks B for evidence of increased risk of breast cancer, such as  the results of a genetic test or a family history of breast cancer,  before the claim for the mammogram is paid. This policy is applied  uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and is not directed at  individuals based on any genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, the plan does not violate  paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section. Under paragraph (c), the plan is  permitted to request and use the results of a genetic test to make a  determination regarding payment, provided the plan requests only the  minimum amount of information necessary. Because the medical  appropriateness of the mammogram depends on the genetic makeup of the  patient, the minimum amount of information necessary includes the  results of the genetic test. Similarly, the plan does not violate  paragraph (d) of this section because the plan is permitted to request  genetic information in making a determination regarding the medical  appropriateness of a claim if the genetic information is necessary to  make the determination (and if the genetic information is not used for  underwriting purposes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual C was previously diagnosed with and  treated for breast cancer, which is currently in remission. In  accordance with the recommendation of C's physician, C has been taking a  regular dose of tamoxifen to help prevent a recurrence. C's group health  plan adopts a new policy requiring patients taking tamoxifen to undergo  a genetic test to ensure that tamoxifen is medically appropriate for  their genetic makeup. In accordance with, at the time, the latest  scientific research, tamoxifen is not helpful in up to 7 percent of  breast cancer patients, those with certain variations of the gene for  making the CYP2D6 enzyme. If a patient has a gene variant  making tamoxifen not medically appropriate, the plan does not pay for  the tamoxifen prescription.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the plan does not violate  paragraph (c) of this section if it conditions future payments for the  tamoxifen prescription on C's undergoing a genetic test to determine  what genetic markers C has for making the CYP2D6 enzyme. Nor  does the plan violate paragraph (c) of this section if the plan refuses  future payment if the results of the genetic test indicate that  tamoxifen is not medically appropriate for C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A group health plan offers a diabetes disease  management program to all similarly situated individuals for whom it is  medically appropriate based on whether the individuals have or are at  risk for diabetes. The program provides enhanced benefits related only  to diabetes for individuals who qualify for the program. The plan sends  out a notice to all participants that describes the diabetes disease  management program and explains the terms for eligibility. Individuals  interested in enrolling in the program are advised to contact the plan  to demonstrate that they have diabetes or that they are at risk for  diabetes. For individuals who do not currently have diabetes, genetic  information may be used to demonstrate that an individual is at risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, the plan may condition benefits  under the disease management program upon a showing by an individual  that the individual is at risk for diabetes, even if such showing may  involve genetic information, provided that the plan requests genetic  information only when necessary to make a determination regarding  whether the disease management program is medically appropriate for the  individual and only requests the minimum amount of information necessary  to make that determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except that the plan  includes a questionnaire that asks about the occurrence of diabetes in  members of the individual's family as part of the notice describing the  disease management program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 5, the plan violates the  requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because the requests  for genetic information are not limited to those situations in which it  is necessary to make a determination regarding whether the disease  management program is medically appropriate for the individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4, except the disease  management program provides an enhanced benefit in the form of a lower  annual deductible to individuals under the program; the lower deductible  applies with respect to all medical expenses incurred by the individual.  Thus, whether or not a claim relates to diabetes, the individual is  provided with a lower deductible based on the individual providing the  plan with genetic information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, because the enhanced benefits  include benefits not related to the determination of medical  appropriateness, making available the enhanced benefits is within the  meaning of underwriting purposes. Accordingly, the plan may not request  or require genetic information (including family history information) in  determining eligibility for enhanced benefits under the program because  such a request would be for underwriting purposes and would violate  paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies for plan  years beginning on or after December 7, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Expiration date. This section expires on or before October 1,  2012.
