                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The DOT creditor operating element shall send a debtor a total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals, unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal (see also Sec. 92.21(a)). Other information may also indicate that additional written demands are unnecessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis for the indebtedness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date by which payment is to be made:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The debtor's liability for interest, penalties and administrative charges in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and Sec. 92.35 of this part, if payment is not received within 30 days of the due date (see Sec. 92.35 for details regarding interest, penalties and administrative costs);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The intent of the agency to collect by salary offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has not made payment by the payment due date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set out in paragraph (b)(8) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The possible submission of claims to a collection agency or referral to the General Accounting Office or the Department of Justice for litigation in accordance with the procedures in 4 CFR part 105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim. Any reasonable costs associated with the inspection and copying of these records shall be borne by the debtor. The debtor shall give reasonable notice in advance to the agency of the date upon which he or she intends to inspect and copy the records involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The right of the debtor to a review of the claim within the agency. If the claim is disputed in full or in part, the debtor shall respond to the demand by making a request in writing for a review of the claim within the agency by the payment due date stated in the demand. The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion shall be paid by the due date. The DOT creditor operating element shall acknowledge receipt of the request for a review, and upon completion of consideration shall notify the debtor whether its determination has been sustained, amended, or canceled within 15 days of the receipt of the request for a review. If the DOT operating element either sustains or

amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect by salary offset unless payment is received within 15 days of the mailing of the notification of its decision following a review of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The right of the debtor to offer to make a written agreement to repay the amount of the claim (see Sec. 92.23). The acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency. If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because a payment of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the DOT creditor operating element will analyze the debtor's financial condition. Depending on its evaluation of the financial strength of the debtor, the DOT operating element may agree to a written installment repayment schedule with the debtor. The debtor shall execute a confession of judgment note which specifies all of the terms of the arrangement. The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Interest, penalties and administrative charges shall be provided in the note (see Sec. 92.35). The debtor shall be provided with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confession of judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation which shall recite that the statement was read and understood before execution of the note and that the note is being signed knowingly and voluntarily. Some form of evidence of these facts shall be maintained in the agency's file on the debtor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The right to an oral hearing or a hearing based on written submissions conducted by an administrative law judge or by a hearing official not under the control of the head of the Department in accordance with Sec. 92.13 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The consequences of any knowingly false statements, representations, or evidence provided by the employee, which may include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disciplinary procedures under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002, or any other applicable statute; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729, et seq., or any other applicable statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Proceedings under any other statutory authority for the collection of claims of the DOT operating element.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The fact that amounts paid on or deducted from the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the accounting or finance officer who may be contacted if the employee wishes to review the records or to obtain information.</p>
