                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the lender's responsibility to protect the guaranteed loan  debt and all the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These  responsibilities include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender will file a proof of claim where necessary and all  the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender will attend and where necessary participate in  meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender, whose collateral is subject to being used by the  trustee in   bankruptcy, will immediately seek adequate protection of the collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> or seek dismissal of the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request  modification of any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that  additional recoveries are likely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be  kept adequately and regularly informed in writing of all aspects of the  proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In a Chapter 11 reorganization, if an independent appraisal of  collateral is necessary in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354's opinion, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  and the lender will share such appraisal fee equally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Expenses on Chapter 11 reorganization, liquidating Chapter 11 or  Chapter 7 (unless the lender is directly handling the liquidation) cases  are not to be deducted from the collateral proceeds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Estimated loss payments. See paragraph XVI of Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-35.</p><p class="depth2">Administrative</p><p class="depth2">Refer to Appendix G of this subpart (available in any FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) for advice on how to  interact with the lender on liquidation and property management.</p><p class="depth2">A. It is the responsibility of the State Program Chief to see that  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is being fully  informed by the lender in all bankruptcy cases.</p><p class="depth2">B. All bankruptcy cases should be reported immediately to the  National Office by utilizing and completing a problem/delinquent status  report. The Regional Attorney must be informed promptly of the  proceedings.</p><p class="depth2">C. Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business  contemplating an ongoing business rather than a termination and  dissolution of the business where legal protection is afforded to the  business as defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Consequently, expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11  reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unless the proceeding  becomes a Liquidating 11. If the proceeding should become a Liquidating  11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted from  proceeds of collateral provided the lender is doing the actual  liquidation of the collateral as provided by the Lender's Agreement.  Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the borrower's assets. If and  when liquidation of the borrower's assets under Chapter 7 is conducted  by the bankruptcy trustee, the lender cannot claim expenses.</p><p class="depth2">D. The State Director may approve the repurchase of the unpaid  guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder(s) to reduce interest  accruals during Chapter 7 proceedings or after a Chapter 11 proceeding  becomes a liquidation proceeding. On loans in bankruptcy, any loss  payment must be halted in accordance with the Lender's Agreement and  carry the approval of the State Director.</p><p class="depth2">E. The State Director must approve in advance and in writing the  lender's estimated liquidation expenses on loans in liquidation  bankruptcy. These expenses must be reasonable and customary and not in- house expenses of the lender.</p><p class="depth2">F. The lender is responsible for advising FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 of the completion of the Chapter 11  reorganization plan; however, the FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 servicing office will monitor the lender's files to  ensure timely notification of servicing actions.</p><p class="depth2">G. If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the  reorganization plan, and the borrower repays in full the remaining  balance of the loan as set forth in the plan without an additional loss  sustained by the lender, a Final Report of Loss is not necessary. The  Finance Office will close out the estimated loss account as a Final Loss  at the time notification of payment in full is received.</p><p class="depth2">H. If the bankruptcy court attempts to direct that loss payments  will be applied to the account other than the unsecured principal first  and then to unsecured accrued interest, the lender is responsible for  notifying the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  servicing office immediately. The FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 servicing office will then obtain advice from OGC on  what actions FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  should take.</p><p class="depth2">I. Protective Advances--Authorized protective advances may be  included with the estimated loss payment associated with the Chapter 11  reorganization provided they were incurred in connection with  liquidation of the account prior to the borrower filing bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth2">J. Adequate Protection--The bankruptcy court can order protection of  the collateral while the borrower is in a reorganization bankruptcy. The  lender whose collateral is   subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy should immediately  seek adequate protection of the collateral, including petitioning for a  super priority.
