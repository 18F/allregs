                            <p class="depth0">Cooperative audit resolution means the use of audit follow-up techniques which promote prompt corrective action by improving communication, fostering collaboration, promoting trust, and developing an understanding between the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This approach is based upon:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A strong commitment by Federal agency and non-Federal entity leadership to program integrity;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal agencies strengthening partnerships and working cooperatively with non-Federal entities and their auditors; and non-Federal entities and their auditors working cooperatively with Federal agencies;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A focus on current conditions and corrective action going forward;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal agencies offering appropriate relief for past noncompliance when audits show prompt corrective action has occurred; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federal agency leadership sending a clear message that continued failure to correct conditions identified by audits which are likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, or abuse is unacceptable and will result in sanctions.</p>
