                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an application is received for the temporary closure of a  waterway for the construction of a structure or the performance of other  work in the waterway, the District Engineer will assure himself of the  necessity for the closure and arrange after informal communication with  any important navigation interests concerned the time and duration of  the closure which will enable the operations to be completed with the  least interference with navigation. If there is no question as to the  necessity and propriety of the closure, the District Engineer is  authorized to inform the applicant as follows: ``The Department of the  Army will interpose no objection to the closure for a stated period  beginning at a specified date: Provided, That prior thereto the  applicant will notify navigation interests by an advertisement in the  press or otherwise as the District Engineer may approve and on the  understanding that the waiver of objection   does not affect the liability of the applicant for any damages that may  arise by reason of the closure.'' The letter to the applicant will be  signed ``By Authority of the Secretary of the Army'' and distribution  made as prescribed for permits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> District Engineers will give careful consideration to the effect  of any closure on through navigation. Should coordination with other  districts be necessary the case will be forwarded to the Division  Engineer for such coordination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cases not falling within the authority above conferred will be  forwarded to the Chief of Engineers with the recommendations of the  Division and District Engineers.    Sec. 209.190  [Reserved]</p>
