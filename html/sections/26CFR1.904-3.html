                                Sec. 1.904-3  Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax by husband
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In General. This section provides rules, in addition to those  prescribed in Sec. 1.904-2, for the carryback and carryover of the  unused foreign tax paid or accrued to a foreign country or possession by  a husband and wife making a joint return for one or more of the taxable  years involved in the computation of the carryback or carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Joint unused foreign tax and joint excess limitation. In the  case of a husband and wife the joint unused foreign tax or the joint  excess limitation for a taxable year for which a joint return is made  shall be computed on the basis of the combined income, deductions,  taxes, and credit of both spouses as if the combined income, deductions,  taxes, and credit were those of one individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Continuous use of joint return. If a husband and wife make a  joint return for the current taxable year, and also make joint returns  for each of the other taxable years involved in the computation of the  carryback or carryover of the unused foreign tax to the current taxable  year, the joint carryback or the joint carryover to the current taxable  year shall be computed on the basis of the joint unused foreign tax and  the joint excess limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> From separate to joint return. If a husband and wife make a  joint return for the current taxable year, but make separate returns for  all of the other taxable years involved in the computation of the  carryback or carryover of   the unused foreign tax to the current taxable year, the separate  carrybacks or separate carryovers shall be a joint carryback or a joint  carryover to the current taxable year. If for such current year the per- country limitation applies, then only the unused foreign tax for a  taxable year of a spouse for which the per-country limitation applied to  such spouse may constitute a carryover or carryback to the current  taxable year. If for such current taxable year the overall limitation  applies, then only the unused foreign tax for a taxable year of a spouse  for which the overall limitation applied to such spouse may constitute a  carryover or carryback to the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amounts carried from or through a joint return year to or  through a separate return year. It is necessary to allocate to each  spouse his share of an unused foreign tax or excess limitation for any  taxable year for which the spouses filed a joint return if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The husband and wife file separate returns for the current  taxable year and an unused foreign tax is carried thereto from a taxable  year for which they filed a joint return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The husband and wife file separate returns for the current  taxable year and an unused foreign tax is carried to such taxable year  from a year for which they filed separate returns but is first carried  through a year for which they filed a joint return; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The husband and wife file a joint return for the current taxable  year and an unused foreign tax is carried from a taxable year for which  they filed joint returns but is first carried through a year for which  they filed separate returns.  In such cases, the separate carryback or carryover of each spouse to the  current taxable year shall be computed in the manner described in Sec.  1.904-2 but with the modifications set forth in paragraph (f) of this  section. Where applicable, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take  into account the fact that, for any taxable year involved in the  computation of the carryback or the carryover, either spouse has  interest income described in section 904(f)(2) with respect to which the  provisions of section 904(f) and Sec. 1.904-4 apply, or dividends  described in section 904(f)(1)(B) with respect to which the provisions  of section 904(f) and Sec. 1.904-5 apply, or foreign oil related income  described in section 907(c) with respect to which the separate  limitation in section 907(b) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Allocation of unused foreign tax and excess limitation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Limitation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Per-country limitation. The per-country limitation of a  particular spouse with respect to a foreign country or United States  possession for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be  the portion of the limitation on the joint return which bears the same  ratio to such limitation as such spouse's taxable income (with gross  income and deductions taken into account to the same extent as taken  into account on the joint return) from sources within such country or  possession (but not in excess of the joint taxable income from sources  within such country or possession) bears to the joint taxable income  from such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overall limitation. The overall limitation of a particular  spouse for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be the  portion of the limitation on the joint return which bears the same ratio  to such limitation as such spouse's taxable income (with gross income  and deductions taken into account to the same extent as taken into  account on the joint return) from sources without the United States (but  not in excess of the joint taxable income from such sources) bears to  the joint taxable income from such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unused foreign tax--(i) Per-country limitation. The unused  foreign tax of a particular spouse with respect to a foreign country or  United States possession for a taxable year for which a joint return is  made shall be the excess of his tax paid or accrued to such country or  possession over his limitation determined under subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Excess limitation--(i) Per-country limitation taxpayer. A  spouse's excess limitation with respect to a foreign country or  possession for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be  the excess of his limitation determined under subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of  this paragraph over his taxes paid or accrued to such country or  possession for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this paragraph over his taxes paid or accrued to  foreign countries and United States possessions for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Excess limitation to be applied. The excess limitation of the  particular spouse for any taxable year which is applied against the  unused foreign tax of that spouse for another taxable year in order to  determine the amount of the unused foreign tax which shall be carried  back or over to a third taxable year shall be, in a case in which the  excess limitation is determined on a joint return, the sum of the  following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reduction of excess limitation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The part of the excess  limitation which is attributable to each spouse for the taxable year, as  determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by  absorbing as taxes deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in that  year the unabsorbed separate unused foreign tax of such spouse, and the  unabsorbed unused foreign tax determined under subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph of such spouse, for taxable years which begin before the  beginning of the year of origin of the unused foreign tax of the  particular spouse against which the excess limitation so determined is  being applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition, the part of the excess limitation which is  attributable to the other spouse for the taxable year, as determined  under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by absorbing  as taxes deemed paid or accrued under section 904(d) in that year the  unabsorbed unused foreign tax, if any, of such other spouse for the  taxable year which begins on the same date as the beginning of the year  of origin of the unused foreign tax of the particular spouse against  which the excess limitation so determined is being applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Spouses using different limitations. If an unused foreign tax is  carried through a taxable year for which spouses made a joint return and  the credit under section 901 for such taxable year is not claimed, and  in the prior taxable year separate returns are made in which the per- country limitation applies to one spouse and the overall limitation  applies to the other spouse, the amount treated as absorbed in the  taxable year for which a joint return is made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  paragraph had the per-country limitation applied for such year to both  spouses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Illustrations. This section may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> H and W, calendar year taxpayers, file joint returns  for 1961 and 1963, and separate returns for 1962, 1964, and 1965; and  for each of those taxable years they choose to claim a credit under  section 901. For the taxable years involved, they had unused foreign  tax, excess limitations, and carrybacks and carryovers of unused foreign  tax as set forth below. The overall limitation applies to both spouses  for all taxable years involved in this example. Neither H nor W   had an unused foreign tax or excess limitation for any year before 1961  or after 1965. For purposes of this example, any reference to an excess  limitation means such a limitation as determined under paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.904-2 but without regard to any taxes deemed paid  or accrued under section 904(d):  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable year</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1961       1962       1963        1964        1965 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Return................................................

The  excess limitation of $300 for 1963 is not required first to be reduced  by any amount, since neither H nor W has any unused foreign tax for  taxable years beginning before 1961.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> H's part ($500) of the joint unused foreign tax for 1961 is  absorbed by his part ($650) of the joint excess limitation for 1963.

The remaining part  ($100) of H's unused foreign tax for 1962 is then absorbed by W's part  of the joint excess limitation for 1963, which must first be reduced  from $300 to $200 by the absorption as taxes deemed paid or accrued in  1963 of the unabsorbed part $100 of W's unused foreign tax for 1961,  which is a taxable year beginning before 1962.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> W's unused foreign tax of $150 for 1964 is first absorbed (to  the extent of $100) by W's part of the joint excess limitation for 1963,  which must first be reduced from $300 to $100 by the absorption as taxes  deemed paid or accrued in 1963 of the unabsorbed part ($100) of W's  unused foreign tax for 1961 and the unabsorbed part ($100) of H's unused  foreign tax for 1962, which are taxable years beginning before 1964. No  part of W's unused foreign tax for 1964 is absorbed by H's part of the  joint excess limitation for 1963, since H's part of that excess must  first be reduced from $650 to $0 by the absorption as taxes deemed paid  or accrued in 1963 of H's unused foreign tax of $500 for 1961 and of the  unabsorbed part ($150) of H's unused foreign tax for 1962, which are  taxable years beginning before 1964. The unabsorbed part ($50) of W's  unused foreign tax for 1964 is then absorbed by W's excess limitation of  $100 for 1965. No part of W's unused foreign tax for 1964 is absorbed by  W's excess limitation for 1962, since that excess limitation must first  be reduced from $200 to $0 by W's unused foreign tax for 1961, which is  a taxable year beginning before 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> No part of H's unused foreign tax of $400 for 1964 is absorbed  by H's part of the joint excess limitation for 1963, since H's part of  that excess must first be reduced from $650 to $0 by the absorption as  taxes deemed paid or accrued in 1963 of H's unused foreign tax of $500  for 1961 and of a part ($150) of H's unused foreign tax for 1962, which  are taxable years beginning before 1964. Moreover, no part of H's unused  foreign tax of $400 for 1964 is absorbed by W's part of the joint excess  limitation for 1963, since W's part of that excess must first be reduced  from $300 to $0 by the absorption as taxes deemed paid or accrued in  1963 of the unabsorbed part ($100) of   W's unused foreign tax for 1961 and of the unabsorbed part ($100) of H's  unused foreign tax for 1962, which are taxable years beginning before  1964, and also by the absorption of a part ($100) of W's unused foreign  tax of $150 for 1964, which is a taxable year beginning on the same date  as the beginning of H's taxable year 1964. The unabsorbed part ($400) of  H's unused foreign tax for 1964 is then absorbed by H's excess  limitation of $500 for 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume the same facts as those in example 1 except  that for 1964 W's unused foreign tax is $20, instead of $150. The  carrybacks and carryovers absorbed are the same as in example 1 except  as indicated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No part of W's unused foreign tax of $20 for 1964 is absorbed by  W's excess limitation for 1962, since that excess must first be reduced  from $200 to $0 by W's unused foreign tax for 1961, which is a taxable  year beginning before 1964. W's unused foreign tax of $20 for 1964 is  absorbed by W's part of the joint excess limitation for 1963, which must  first be reduced from $300 to $100 by the absorption as taxes deemed  paid or accrued in 1963 of the unabsorbed part ($100) of W's unused  foreign tax for 1961 and the unabsorbed part ($100) of H's unused  foreign tax for 1962, which are taxable years beginning before 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For the reason given in paragraph (f) of example 1, no part of  H's unused foreign tax of $400 for 1964 is absorbed by H's part of the  joint excess limitation for 1963. H's unused foreign tax of $400 for  1964 is first absorbed (to the extent of $80) by W's part of the joint  excess limitation for 1963, which must first be reduced from $300 to $80  by the absorption as taxes deemed paid or accrued in 1963 of the  unabsorbed part ($100) of W's unused foreign tax for 1961 and of the  unabsorbed part ($100) of H's unused foreign tax for 1962, which are  taxable years beginning before 1964, and also by the absorption of W's  unused foreign tax of $20 for 1964, which is a taxable year beginning on  the same date as the beginning of H's taxable year 1964. The unabsorbed  part ($320) of H's unused foreign tax for 1964 is then absorbed by H's  excess limitation of $500 for 1965.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the  per-country limitation applies to both spouses for all taxable years  involved in the example and that excess limitations and the unused  foreign taxes relate to a single foreign country. The carryovers and  carrybacks are the same as in example 1.
