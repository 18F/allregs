Logs must be established and properly maintained as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The log must be kept in an orderly manner. The log may be kept electronically or in writing. The required information for the particular class or category of station must be readily available. Key letters or abbreviations may be used if their proper meaning or explanation is contained elsewhere in the same log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Erasures, obliterations, or willful destruction of written logs, or deletions of data or willful destruction of computer files or computer hardware containing electronic logs, is prohibited during the retention period. Corrections may be made only by the person originating the entry by striking out the error, initialing the correction and indicating the date of correction. With respect to electronic logs, striking out the error is to be accomplished using a strike-through formatting effect or a similar software function, and the correction is to be acknowledged through a dated electronic signature at the location of the strike-through.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ship station logs must identify the vessel name, country of registry, and official number of the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The station licensee and the radio operator in charge of the station are

responsible for the maintenance of station logs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability and retention. Station logs must be made available to authorized Commission employees upon request and retained as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Logs must be retained by the licensee for a period of two years from the date of entry, and, when applicable, for such additional periods as required by the following paragraphs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Logs relating to a distress situation or disaster must be retained for three years from the date of entry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Commission has notified the licensee of an investigation, the related logs must be retained until the licensee is specifically authorized in writing to destroy them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Logs relating to any claim or complaint of which the station licensee has notice must be retained until the claim or complaint has been satisfied or barred by statute limiting the time for filing suits upon such claims.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Logs containing entries required by paragraph (c) of this section must be kept either at the principal control point of the station or electronically filed at the station licensee's primary office or available to the Commission via secured access to the licensee's Internet web site.
