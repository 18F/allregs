                            <p class="depth0">As a result of participation in the Federal catalog system, activities may receive data directly from DLSC tailored to their individual needs in support of their own supply management data system. The two basic categories of file maintenance are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Simplified file maintenance (SFM). Subscribers to this category of file maintenance are provided replacement files (magnetic tape) semiannually containing selected technical and supply management data for those items on which they are a registered user. The subscriber will also receive a monthly maintenance update and cumulative monthly basic records from DLSC

which may be used to maintain the semiannual basic file. Recipients of this form of file maintenance have latitude in selecting those items which meet the needs of their supply system from the categories of data available from the Federal Catalog System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regular file maintenance (RFM). This form of the file maintenance provides activities with data on a daily basis as transactions affect items upon which they are a registered user. It is used primarily by those activities which consider it essential to maintain file compatibility with the DLSC file at all times.
