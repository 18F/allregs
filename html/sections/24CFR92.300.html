                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within 24 months after the date that HUD notifies the  participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment  Partnerships Agreement, the participating jurisdiction must reserve not  less than 15 percent of the HOME allocation for investment only in  housing to be owned, developed or sponsored by community housing  development organizations. For a State, the HOME allocation includes  funds reallocated under Sec. 92.451(c)(2)(i) and, for a unit of general  local government, includes funds transferred from a State under Sec.  92.102(b). The participating jurisdiction must certify the organization  as meeting the definition of ``community housing development  organization'' and must document that the organization has capacity to  own, develop, or sponsor housing each time it commits funds to the  organization. For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funds are reserved when a participating jurisdiction enters into  a written agreement with the community housing development organization  (or project owner as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section)  committing the funds to a specific local project in accordance with  paragraph (2) of the definition of ``commitment'' in Sec. 92.2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rental housing is ``owned'' by the community housing development  organization if the community housing development organization is the  owner in fee simple absolute of multifamily or single family housing (or  has a long term ground lease) for rental to low-income families in  accordance with Sec. 92.252. If the housing is to be rehabilitated or  constructed, the community housing development organization hires and  oversees the developer that rehabilitates or constructs the housing. At  minimum, the community housing development organization must hire or  contract with an experienced project manager to oversee all aspects of  the development, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME  financing, selecting a developer or general contractor, overseeing the  progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. The  community housing development organization must own the rental housing  during development and for a period at least equal to the period of  affordability in Sec. 92.252. If the CHDO acquires housing that meets  the property standards in Sec. 92.251, the CHDO must own the rental  housing for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in  Sec. 92.252.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rental housing is ``developed'' by the community development  housing organization if the community housing development organization  is the owner of multifamily or single family housing in fee simple  absolute (or has a long term ground lease) and the developer of new  housing that will be constructed or existing substandard housing that  will be rehabilitated for rent to low-income families in accordance with  Sec. 92.252. To be the ``developer,'' the community development housing  organization must be in sole charge of all aspects of the development  process, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME financing,  selecting architects, engineers and general contractors, overseeing the  progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. At a  minimum, the community housing development organization must own the  housing during development and for a period at least equal to the period  of affordability in Sec. 92.252.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rental housing is ``sponsored'' by the community development  housing organization if it is rental housing ``owned'' or ``developed''  by a subsidiary of a community housing development organization, a  limited partnership of which the community housing development  organization or its subsidiary is the sole general partner, or a limited  liability company of which the community housing development   organization or its subsidiary is the sole managing member.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subsidiary of the community housing development organization  may be a for-profit or nonprofit organization and must be wholly owned  by the community housing development organization. If the limited  partnership or limited liability company agreement permits the community  housing development organization to be removed as general partner or  sole managing member, the agreement must provide that the removal must  be for cause and that the community housing development organization  must be replaced with another community housing development  organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The HOME funds must be provided to the entity that owns the  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em>, is  subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The private nonprofit organization may not be created by a  governmental entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The HOME funds must be invested in the project that is owned by  the community housing development organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before commitment of HOME funds, the community housing  development organization sponsor must select the nonprofit organization  that will obtain ownership of the property.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The nonprofit organization assumes the community housing  development organization's HOME obligations (including any repayment of  loans) for the rental project at a specified time after completion of  development.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the housing is not transferred to the nonprofit organization,  the community housing development organization sponsor remains  responsible for the HOME assistance and the HOME project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Housing for homeownership is ``developed'' by the community  development housing organization if the community housing development  organization is the owner (in fee simple absolute) and developer of new  housing that will be constructed or existing substandard housing that  will be rehabilitated for sale to low-income families in accordance with  Sec. 92.254.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To be the ``developer'' the community development housing  organization must arrange financing of the project and be in sole charge  of construction. The community housing development organization may  provide direct homeownership assistance (e.g., downpayment assistance)  when it sells the housing to low-income families and the community  housing development organization will not be considered a subrecipient.  The HOME funds for downpayment assistance shall not be greater than 10  percent of the amount of HOME funds for development of the housing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The participating jurisdiction must determine and set forth in  its written agreement with the community housing development  organization the actual sales prices of the housing or the method by  which the sales prices for the housing will be established and whether  the proceeds must be returned to the participating jurisdiction or may  be retained by the community housing development organization.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> While proceeds that the participating jurisdiction permits the  community housing development organization to retain are not subject to  the requirements of this part, the participating jurisdiction must  specify in the written agreement with the community housing development  organization whether the proceeds are to be used for HOME-eligible  activities or other housing activities to benefit low-income families.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Funds that are recaptured because the housing no longer meets  the affordability requirements under Sec. 92.254(a)(5)(ii) are subject  to the requirements of this part in accordance with Sec. 92.503.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The participating jurisdiction determines the form of assistance  (e.g., grant or loan) that it will provide to the community housing  development organization receives or, for rental housing projects under  paragraph (a)(4)   of this section, to the entity that owns the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each participating jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to  identify community housing development organizations that are capable,  or can reasonably be expected to become capable, of carrying out  elements of the jurisdiction's approved consolidated plan and to  encourage such community housing development organizations to do so. If  during the first 24 months of its participation in the HOME Program a  participating jurisdiction cannot identify a sufficient number of  capable community housing development organizations, up to 20 percent of  the minimum community housing development organization setaside of 15  percent specified in paragraph (a) of this section, above, (but not more  than $150,000 during the 24 month period) may be committed to develop  the capacity of community housing development organizations in the  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Up to 10 percent of the HOME funds reserved under this section  may be used for activities specified under Sec. 92.301.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If funds for operating expenses are provided under Sec. 92.208  to a community housing development organization that is not also  receiving funds under paragraph (a) of this section for housing to be  owned, developed or sponsored by the community housing development  organization, the participating jurisdiction's written agreement with  the community housing development organization must provide that the  community housing development organization is expected to receive funds  under paragraph (a) of this section for a project within 24 months of  the date of receiving the funds for operating expenses, and specifies  the terms and conditions upon which this expectation is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The participating jurisdiction must ensure that a community  housing development organization does not receive HOME funding for any  fiscal year in an amount that provides more than 50 percent or $50,000,  whichever is greater, of the community housing development  organization's total operating expenses in that fiscal year. This also  includes organizational support and housing education provided under  section 233(b)(1), (2), and (6) of the Act, as well as funds for  operating expenses provided under Sec. 92.208.
