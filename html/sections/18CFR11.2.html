                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reasonable annual charges for recompensing the United States for the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of its lands (other than lands adjoining or pertaining to Government dams or other structures owned by the United States Government) or its other property, will be fixed by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule. Annual charges for the use of government lands will be payable in advance, and will be set on the basis of an annual schedule of per-acre rental fees, as set forth in Appendix A of this part. The Executive Director will publish the updated fee schedule in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The annual per-acre rental fee is the product of four factors: the adjusted per-acre value multiplied by the encumbrance factor multiplied by the rate of return multiplied by the annual adjustment factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adjusted per-acre value. (i) Counties (or other geographical areas) are assigned a per-acre value based on their average per-acre land and building value published in the Census of Agriculture (Census) by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The adjusted per-acre value is computed by reducing the NASS Census land and building value by the sum of a state-specific modifier and seven percent. A table of state-specific adjustments will be available on the Commission's Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The state-specific modifier is a percentage reduction applicable to all counties or geographic areas in a state (except Puerto Rico), and represents the ratio of the total value of irrigated farmland in the state to the total value of all farmland in the state. The state-specific modifier will be recalculated every five years beginning in payment year 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The state-specific modifier for Puerto Rico is 13 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Encumbrance factor. The encumbrance factor is 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rate of return. The rate of return is 5.77 percent through payment year 2025. The rate of return will be adjusted every 10 years thereafter, and will be based on the 10-year average of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the applicable NASS Census. For example, for years 2026 through 2035, the rate of return will be based on the 10-year average (2012-2021) of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the 2022 NASS Census. If the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate is not available, the next longest term Treasury bond available should be used in its place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annual adjustment factor. The annual adjustment factor is 1.9 percent through payment year 2015. For years 2016 through 2025, the annual adjustment factor is the annual change in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) for the ten years (2014-2023) preceding issuance (2024) of the most recent NASS Census (2022). Each subsequent ten year adjustment will be made in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The annual charge for the use of Government lands for 2013 will be reduced by 25 percent for all licensees subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The minimum annual charge for the use of Government lands under any license will be $25.
