                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who may be an assignee. Only a provider, or supplier that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not a party to the initial determination as defined in Sec.  405.906; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Furnished an item or service to the beneficiary may seek  assignment of appeal rights from the beneficiary for that item or  service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who may not be an assignee. An individual or entity who is not a  provider or supplier may not be an assignee. A provider or supplier that  furnishes an item or service to a beneficiary may not seek assignment  for that item or service when considered a party to the initial  determination as defined in Sec. 405.906.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for a valid assignment of appeal right. The  assignment of appeal rights must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be executed using a CMS standard form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be in writing and signed by both the beneficiary assigning his  or her appeal rights and by the assignee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indicate the item or service for which the assignment of appeal  rights is authorized;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contain a waiver of the assignee's right to collect payment from  the assignor for the specific item or service that are the subject of  the appeal except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be submitted at the same time the request for redetermination or  other appeal is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of right to collect payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the assignee must waive the right to  collect payment for the item or service for which the assignment of  appeal rights is made. If the assignment is revoked under paragraph  (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this section, the waiver of the right to collect  payment nevertheless remains valid. A waiver of the right to collect  payment remains in effect regardless of the outcome of the appeal  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The assignee is not prohibited from recovering payment  associated with coinsurance or deductibles or when an advance  beneficiary notice is properly executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of a valid assignment of appeal rights. Unless revoked,  the assignment of appeal rights is valid for all administrative and  judicial review associated with the item or service as indicated on the  standard CMS form, even in the event of the death of the assignor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Rights of the assignee. When a valid assignment of appeal rights  is executed, the assignor transfers all appeal rights involving the  particular item or service to the assignee. These include, but are not  limited to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtaining information about the claim to the same extent as the  assignor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitting evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Making statements about facts or law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Making any request, or giving, or receiving any notice about  appeal proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Revocation of assignment. When an assignment of appeal rights is  revoked, the rights to appeal revert to the assignor. An assignment of  appeal rights may be revoked in any of the following ways:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In writing by the assignor. The revocation of assignment must be  delivered to the adjudicator and the assignee, and is effective on the  date of receipt by the adjudicator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By abandonment if the assignee does not file an appeal of an  unfavorable decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By act or omission by the assignee that is determined by an  adjudicator to be contrary to the financial interests of the assignor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Responsibilities of the assignee. Once the assignee files an  appeal, the assignee becomes a party to the appeal. The assignee must  meet all requirements for appeals that apply to any other party.
