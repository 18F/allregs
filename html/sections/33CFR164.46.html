                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">Automatic Identification Systems or AIS means a maritime navigation  safety communications system standardized by the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), adopted by the International Maritime  Organization (IMO), that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provides vessel information, including the vessel's identity,  type, position, course, speed, navigational status and other safety- related information automatically to appropriately equipped shore  stations, other ships, and aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receives automatically such information from similarly fitted  ships, monitors and tracks ships; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exchanges data with shore-based facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Gross tonnage means tonnage as defined under the International  Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.</p><p class="depth0">International voyage means a voyage from a country to which the  present International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea applies  to a port outside such country, or conversely.</p><p class="depth0">Properly installed, operational means an Automatic Identification  System (AIS) that is installed and operated using the guidelines set  forth by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution  A.917(22) and Safety of Navigation Circulars (SN/Circ.) 227, 244, 245,  and SN.1/Circ.289; or National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA)  Installation Standard 0400-3.10 in lieu of SN/Circ.227 and 245  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 164.03).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> AIS carriage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> AIS Class A device. The following vessels must  have on board a properly installed, operational Coast Guard type- approved AIS Class A device:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A self-propelled vessel of 65 feet or more in length, engaged in  commercial service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A towing vessel of 26 feet or more in length and more than 600  horsepower, engaged in commercial service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A self-propelled vessel that is certificated to carry more  than 150 passengers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A self-propelled vessel engaged in dredging operations in or  near a commercial channel or shipping fairway in a manner likely to  restrict or affect navigation of other vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A self-propelled vessel engaged in the movement of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Certain dangerous cargo as defined in subpart C of part 160 of  this chapter, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk that is listed in  46 CFR 30.25-1, Table 30.25-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> AIS Class B device. Use of a Coast Guard type-approved AIS Class  B device in lieu of an AIS Class A device is permissible on the  following vessels if they are not subject to pilotage by other than the  vessel Master or crew:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fishing industry vessels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section that  are certificated to carry less than 150 passengers and that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Do not operate in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) or Vessel  Movement Reporting System (VMRS) area defined in Table 161.12(c) of  Sec. 161.12 of this chapter, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Do not operate at speeds in excess of 14 knots; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section  engaged in dredging operations.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b): Under 33 U.S.C. 1223(b)(3) and 33 CFR  160.111, a Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) may restrict the  operation of a vessel if he or she determines that by reason of weather,  visibility, sea conditions, port congestion, other hazardous  circumstances, or the condition of such vessel, the restriction is  justified in the interest of safety. In certain circumstances, if a COTP  is concerned that the operation of a vessel not subject to Sec. 164.46  would be unsafe, the COTP may determine that voluntary installation of  AIS by the operator would mitigate that concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> SOLAS provisions. The following self-propelled vessels must  comply with International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS),  as amended, Chapter V, regulation 19.2.1.6 (Positioning System), 19.2.4  (AIS Class A), and 19.2.3.5 (Transmitting Heading Device) or 19.2.5.1  (Gyro Compass) as applicable (Incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 164.03):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A vessel of 300 gross tonnage or more, on an international  voyage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A vessel of 150 gross tonnage or more, when carrying more than  12 passengers on an international voyage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Operations. The requirements in this paragraph are applicable to  any vessel equipped with AIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use of AIS does not relieve the vessel of the requirements to  sound whistle signals or display lights or shapes in accordance with the  International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72  COLREGS), 28 U.S.T. 3459, T.I.A.S. 8587, or Inland Navigation Rules, 33  CFR part 83; nor of the radio requirements of the Vessel Bridge-to- Bridge Radiotelephone Act, 33 U.S.C. 1201-1208, part 26 of this chapter,  and 47 CFR part 80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> AIS must be maintained in effective operating condition, which  includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ability to reinitialize the AIS, which requires access to  and knowledge of the AIS power source and password;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ability to access AIS information from the primary conning  position of the vessel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The accurate broadcast of a properly assigned Maritime Mobile  Service Identity (MMSI) number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The accurate input and upkeep of all AIS data fields and system  updates; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For those vessels denoted in paragraph (b) of this section, the  continual operation of AIS and its associated devices (e.g., positioning  system, gyro, converters, displays) at all times while the vessel is  underway or at anchor, and, if moored, at least 15 minutes prior to  getting underway; except when its operation would compromise the safety  or security of the vessel or a security incident is imminent. The AIS  should be returned to continuous operation as soon as the compromise has  been mitigated or the security incident has passed. The time and reason  for the silent period should be recorded in the ship's official log and  reported to the nearest Captain of the Port or Vessel Traffic Center  (VTC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> AIS safety-related text messaging must be conducted in English  and solely to exchange or communicate pertinent navigation safety  information (analogous to a SECURITE broadcast). Although not  prohibited, AIS text messaging should not be relied upon as the primary  means for broadcasting distress (MAYDAY) or urgent (PAN PAN)  communications. (47 CFR 80.1109, Distress, urgency, and safety  communications).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> AIS application-specific messaging (ASM) is permissible, but is  limited to applications adopted by the International Maritime  Organization (such as IMO SN.1/Circ.289) or those denoted in the  International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse  Authorities' (IALA) ASM Collection for use in the United States or  Canada, and to no more than one ASM per minute.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d): The Coast Guard has developed the ``U.S. AIS  Encoding Guide'' to help ensure consistent and accurate data encoding  (input) by AIS users. This Guide is available at our ``AIS Frequently  Asked Questions'' (FAQ 2) World Wide Web page at  www.navcen.uscg.gov. Although of great benefit, the interfacing or  installation of other external devices or displays (e.g., transmitting  heading device, gyro, rate of turn indicator, electronic charting  systems, and radar), is not currently required except as denoted in  Sec. 164.46(c). Most application-specific messages require interfacing  to an   external system that is capable of their portrayal, such as equipment  certified to meet Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services  (RTCM) electronic chart system (ECS) standard 10900 series.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Watchkeeping. AIS is primarily intended for use by the Master or  person in charge of the vessel, or by the person designated by the  Master or person in charge to pilot or direct the movement of the  vessel, who must maintain a periodic watch for AIS information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Portable AIS. The use of a portable AIS is permissible only to  the extent that electromagnetic interference does not affect the proper  function of existing navigation and communication equipment on board and  such that only one AIS device may be transmitting on board a vessel at  any one time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> AIS Pilot Plug. The AIS Pilot Plug on any vessel subject to  pilotage by other than the vessel Master or crew must be readily  available and easily accessible from the primary conning position of the  vessel and permanently affixed (not an extension cord) and adjacent  (within 3 feet) to a 120-volt 50/60 Hz AC power receptacle (NEMA 5-15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions. The following vessels may seek up to a 5-year  deviation from the AIS requirements of this section by requesting a  deviation under Sec. 164.55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels that operate solely within a very confined area (e.g.,  less than a 1 nautical-mile radius, shipyard, or barge fleeting  facility);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vessels that conduct only short voyages (less than 1 nautical  mile) on a fixed schedule (e.g., a bank-to-bank river ferry service or a  tender vessel);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Vessels that are not likely to encounter other AIS-equipped  vessels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Vessels whose design or construction makes it impracticable to  operate an AIS device (e.g., those that lack electrical power, have an  exposed or open cabin, or are submersible); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessels denoted in paragraph (b)(2) that seek a deviation from  requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e) of this section because  their AIS Class B device lacks a display.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prohibition. Except for maritime support stations (see 47 CFR  80.5) licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),  broadcasts from AIS Class A or B devices on aircraft, non-self propelled  vessels or from land are prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Implementation date. Those vessels identified in paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section that were not previously subject to AIS carriage  must install AIS no later than March 1, 2016.  [USCG-2005-21869, 80 FR 5335, Jan. 30, 2015, as amended at 17327, Apr.  1, 2015]</p>
