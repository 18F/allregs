                            <p class="depth0">To exempt employees employed in first processing, canning, or processing products composed of the named commodities and a substantial amount of ingredients not named in the exemptions would be contrary to the language and purposes of such exemptions which specifically enumerate the commodities on which exempt operations were intended to be performed. Consequently, in such situations all operations performed on the mixed products at and from the time of the addition of the foreign ingredients, including those activities which are an integral part of first processing, canning, or processing are nonexempt activities. However, activities performed in connection with such operations on the named aquatic products prior to the addition of the foreign ingredients are deemed exempt operations under the applicable exemption. Where the commodity produced from named aquatic products contains an insubstantial amount of products not named in the exemption, the operations will be considered as performed on the aquatic products and handling and preparation of the foreign ingredients for use in the exempt operations will also be considered as exempt activities.</p>
