For guaranteed loan-only applications that are purchasing an existing RES, the technical report requirements can be provided in the technical feasibility section of the Feasibility Study, instead of completing separate technical report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technical report areas.

Otherwise, the area will receive a fail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination. The Agency will compile the results for each area of the technical report to determine how to further process an application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A project whose technical report receives a ``pass'' in each of the applicable technical report areas will be considered to have ``technical merit'' and is eligible for further consideration for funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A project whose technical report receives a ``fail'' in any one technical report area will be considered to be without technical merit and is not be eligible for funding.</p>
