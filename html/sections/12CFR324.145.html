                                Sec. 324.145  Recognition of credit risk mitigants for securitization
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. An originating FDIC-supervised institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge its securitization exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization that satisfies the operational criteria in Sec. 324.141 may recognize the credit risk mitigant, but only as provided in this section. An investing FDIC-supervised institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize the credit risk

mitigant, but only as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Collateral--(1) Rules of recognition. An FDIC-supervised institution may recognize financial collateral in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure (other than a repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, or an OTC derivative contract for which the FDIC-supervised institution has reflected collateral in its determination of exposure amount under Sec. 324.132) as follows. The FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralized securitization exposure is equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as calculated under the SSFA in Sec. 324.144 or under the SFA in Sec. 324.143 multiplied by the ratio of adjusted exposure amount (SE*) to original exposure amount (SE), where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> SE* equals max {0, [SE - C x (1- Hs - Hfx)]{time} ;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> SE equals the amount of the securitization exposure calculated under Sec. 324.142(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> C equals the current fair value of the collateral;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Hs equals the haircut appropriate to the collateral type; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Hfx equals the haircut appropriate for any currency mismatch between the collateral and the exposure.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10SE13.048</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Standard supervisory haircuts. Unless an FDIC-supervised institution qualifies for use of and uses own-estimates haircuts in paragraph (b)(4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must use the collateral type haircuts (Hs) in Table 1 to Sec. 324.132 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must use a currency mismatch haircut (Hfx) of 8 percent if the exposure and the collateral are denominated in different currencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must multiply the supervisory haircuts obtained in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section by the square root of 6.5 (which equals 2.549510); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period longer than 65 business days where and as appropriate to take into account the illiquidity of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Own estimates for haircuts. With the prior written approval of the FDIC, an FDIC-supervised institution may calculate haircuts using its own internal estimates of market price volatility and foreign exchange volatility, subject to Sec. 324.132(b)(2)(iii). The minimum holding period (TM) for securitization exposures is 65 business days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Guarantees and credit derivatives--(1) Limitations on recognition. An FDIC-supervised institution may only recognize an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ECL for securitization exposures. When an FDIC-supervised institution recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a securitization exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must also:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculate ECL for the protected portion of the exposure using the same

risk parameters that it uses for calculating the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Add the exposure's ECL to the FDIC-supervised institution's total ECL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rules of recognition. An FDIC-supervised institution may recognize an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative provided by an eligible guarantor in determining the FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full coverage. If the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative equals or exceeds the amount of the securitization exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution may set the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure equal to the risk-weighted asset amount for a direct exposure to the eligible guarantor (as determined in the wholesale risk weight function described in Sec. 324.131), using the FDIC-supervised institution's PD for the guarantor, the FDIC-supervised institution's LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the amount of the securitization exposure (as determined in Sec. 324.142(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partial coverage. If the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative is less than the amount of the securitization exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution may set the risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Covered portion. The risk-weighted asset amount for a direct exposure to the eligible guarantor (as determined in the wholesale risk weight function described in Sec. 324.131), using the FDIC-supervised institution's PD for the guarantor, the FDIC-supervised institution's LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the protection amount of the credit risk mitigant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Uncovered portion. (1) 1.0 minus the ratio of the protection amount of the eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative to the amount of the securitization exposure); multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The risk-weighted asset amount for the securitization exposure without the credit risk mitigant (as determined in Sec. Sec. 324.142 through 324.146).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mismatches. The FDIC-supervised institution must make applicable adjustments to the protection amount as required in Sec. 324.134(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure and any more senior securitization exposure that benefits from the hedge. In the context of a synthetic securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the FDIC-supervised institution must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all the hedged exposures.
