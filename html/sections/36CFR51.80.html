In establishing these comparable franchise fees, the Director will take into account, as appropriate, variations in the nature and type of visitor services authorized by particular concession contracts, including, but not limited to, length of the visitor experience, type of equipment utilized, relative expense levels, and other relevant factors. The terms and conditions of an existing concession contract will not be subject to modification or open to renegotiation by the Director because of the award of a new concession contract at the same approximate location or utilizing the same resource.</p>
