                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part. Except as specifically  provided in this section, terms used in this part retain the meaning  accorded them under the applicable provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Act means the Clean Air Act, as amended by Pub. L. 101-549, 42  U.S.C. 7401, et seq.</p><p class="depth0">Applicable requirement shall have the same meaning as provided under  part 70 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the equipment (including but not limited to  hoods, ducts, fans, and booths) used to contain, capture and transport a  pollutant to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous compliance determination method means a method, specified  by the applicable standard or an applicable permit condition, which:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Is used to determine compliance with an emission limitation or  standard on a continuous basis, consistent with the averaging period  established for the emission limitation or standard; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Provides data either in units of the standard or correlated  directly with the compliance limit.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means equipment, other than inherent process  equipment, that is used to destroy or remove air pollutant(s) prior to  discharge to the atmosphere. The types of equipment that may commonly be  used as control devices include, but are not limited to, fabric filters,  mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, inertial separators,  afterburners, thermal or catalytic incinerators, adsorption devices  (such as carbon beds), condensers, scrubbers (such as wet collection and  gas absorption devices), selective catalytic or non-catalytic reduction  systems, flue gas recirculation systems, spray dryers, spray towers,  mist eliminators, acid plants, sulfur recovery plants, injection systems  (such as water, steam, ammonia, sorbent or limestone injection), and  combustion devices independent of the particular process being conducted  at an emissions unit (e.g., the destruction of emissions achieved by  venting process emission streams to flares, boilers or process heaters).  For purposes of this part, a control device does not include passive  control measures that act to prevent pollutants from forming, such as  the use of seals, lids, or roofs to prevent the release of pollutants,  use of low-polluting fuel or feedstocks, or the use of combustion or  other process design features or characteristics. If an applicable  requirement establishes that particular equipment which otherwise meets  this definition of a control device does not constitute a control device  as applied to a particular pollutant-specific emissions unit, then that  definition shall be binding for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Data means the results of any type of monitoring or method,  including the results of instrumental or non-instrumental monitoring,  emission calculations, manual sampling procedures, recordkeeping  procedures, or any other form of information collection procedure used  in connection with any type of monitoring or method.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation or standard means any applicable requirement  that constitutes an emission limitation, emission standard, standard of  performance or means of emission limitation as defined under the Act. An  emission limitation or standard may be expressed in terms of the  pollutant, expressed either   as a specific quantity, rate or concentration of emissions (e.g., pounds  of SO2 per hour, pounds of SO2 per million British  thermal units of fuel input, kilograms of VOC per liter of applied  coating solids, or parts per million by volume of SO2) or as  the relationship of uncontrolled to controlled emissions (e.g.,  percentage capture and destruction efficiency of VOC or percentage  reduction of SO2). An emission limitation or standard may  also be expressed either as a work practice, process or control device  parameter, or other form of specific design, equipment, operational, or  operation and maintenance requirement. For purposes of this part, an  emission limitation or standard shall not include general operation  requirements that an owner or operator may be required to meet, such as  requirements to obtain a permit, to operate and maintain sources in  accordance with good air pollution control practices, to develop and  maintain a malfunction abatement plan, to keep records, submit reports,  or conduct monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">Emissions unit shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Exceedance shall mean a condition that is detected by monitoring  that provides data in terms of an emission limitation or standard and  that indicates that emissions (or opacity) are greater than the  applicable emission limitation or standard (or less than the applicable  standard in the case of a percent reduction requirement) consistent with  any averaging period specified for averaging the results of the  monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">Excursion shall mean a departure from an indicator range established  for monitoring under this part, consistent with any averaging period  specified for averaging the results of the monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">Inherent process equipment means equipment that is necessary for the  proper or safe functioning of the process, or material recovery  equipment that the owner or operator documents is installed and operated  primarily for purposes other than compliance with air pollution  regulations. Equipment that must be operated at an efficiency higher  than that achieved during normal process operations in order to comply  with the applicable emission limitation or standard is not inherent  process equipment. For the purposes of this part, inherent process  equipment is not considered a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Major source shall have the same meaning as provided under part 70  or 71 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring means any form of collecting data on a routine basis to  determine or otherwise assess compliance with emission limitations or  standards. Recordkeeping may be considered monitoring where such records  are used to determine or assess compliance with an emission limitation  or standard (such as records of raw material content and usage, or  records documenting compliance with work practice requirements). The  conduct of compliance method tests, such as the procedures in appendix A  to part 60 of this chapter, on a routine periodic basis may be  considered monitoring (or as a supplement to other monitoring), provided  that requirements to conduct such tests on a one-time basis or at such  times as a regulatory authority may require on a non-regular basis are  not considered monitoring requirements for purposes of this paragraph.  Monitoring may include one or more than one of the following data  collection techniques, where appropriate for a particular circumstance:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Continuous emission or opacity monitoring systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Continuous process, capture system, control device or other  relevant parameter monitoring systems or procedures, including a  predictive emission monitoring system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Emission estimation and calculation procedures (e.g., mass  balance or stoichiometric calculations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Maintenance and analysis of records of fuel or raw materials  usage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Recording results of a program or protocol to conduct specific  operation and maintenance procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Verification of emissions, process parameters, capture system  parameters, or control device parameters using portable or in situ  measurement devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Visible emission observations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> Any other form of measuring, recording, or verifying on a  routine basis   emissions, process parameters, capture system parameters, control device  parameters or other factors relevant to assessing compliance with  emission limitations or standards.</p><p class="depth2">Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates,  controls or supervises a stationary source subject to this part.</p><p class="depth2">Part 70 or 71 permit shall have the same meaning as provided under  part 70 or 71 of this chapter, provided that it shall also refer to a  permit issued, renewed, amended, revised, or modified under any federal  permit program promulgated under title V of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Part 70 or 71 permit application shall mean an application  (including any supplement to a previously submitted application) that is  submitted by the owner or operator in order to obtain a part 70 or 71  permit.</p><p class="depth2">Permitting authority shall have the same meaning as provided under  part 70 or 71 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Pollutant-specific emissions unit means an emissions unit considered  separately with respect to each regulated air pollutant.</p><p class="depth2">Potential to emit shall have the same meaning as provided under part  70 or 71 of this chapter, provided that it shall be applied with respect  to an ``emissions unit'' as defined under this part in addition to a  ``stationary source'' as provided under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) means a system that  uses process and other parameters as inputs to a computer program or  other data reduction system to produce values in terms of the applicable  emission limitation or standard.</p><p class="depth2">Regulated air pollutant shall have the same meaning as provided  under part 70 or 71 of this chapter.</p>
