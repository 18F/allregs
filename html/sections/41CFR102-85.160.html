                                Sec. 102-85.160  How does a customer agency know how much to budget
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent  increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA  will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an  opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must  obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying  customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice  of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated  to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned  buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate,  shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the  customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New assignments;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Changes in current assignments;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Leased space;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New tenant improvement amortization;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Building specific security costs; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due  to changes in scope of proposed projects   or repair and/or replacement of building components</p>
