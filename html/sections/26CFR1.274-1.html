                                Sec. 1.274-1  Disallowance of certain entertainment, gift and travel
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 274 disallows in whole, or in part, certain expenditures for  entertainment, gifts and travel which would otherwise be allowable under  Chapter 1 of the Code. The requirements imposed by section 274 are in  addition to the requirements for deductibility imposed by other  provisions of the Code. If a deduction is claimed for an expenditure for  entertainment, gifts, or travel, the taxpayer must first establish that  it is otherwise allowable as a deduction under Chapter 1 of the Code  before the provisions of section 274 become applicable. An expenditure  for entertainment, to the extent it is lavish or extravagant, shall not  be allowable as a deduction. The taxpayer should then substantiate such  an expenditure in accordance with the rules under section 274(d). See  Sec. 1.274-5. Section 274 is a disallowance provision exclusively, and  does not make deductible any expense which is disallowed under any other  provision of the Code. Similarly, section 274 does not affect the  includability of an item in, or the excludability of an item from, the  gross income of any taxpayer. For specific provisions with respect to  the deductibility of expenditures: for an activity of a type generally  considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and  for a facility used in connection with such an activity, as well as  certain travel expenses of a spouse, etc., see Sec. 1.274-2; for  expenses for gifts, see Sec. 1.274-3; for expenses for foreign travel,  see Sec. 1.274-4; for expenditures deductible without regard to  business activity, see Sec. 1.274-6; and for treatment of personal  portion of entertainment facility, see Sec. 1.274-7.  [T.D. 6659, 28 FR 6499, June 25, 1963, as amended by T.D. 8666, 61 FR  27006, May 30, 1996]</p>
