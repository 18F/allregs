Such energy absorption is characterized by both molar absorption coefficient (molar extinction coefficient) and band width. However, the absence of measurable absorption does not preclude the possibility of photodegradation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definitions and units. The UV-VIS absorption spectrum of a solution is a function of the concentration, c1, expressed in mol/L, of all absorbing species present; the path length, d, of the spectrophotometer cell, expressed in cm; and the molar absorption (extinction) coefficient,[epsi]i, of each species. The absorbance (optical density) A of the solution is then given by:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.045

For a resolvable absorbance peak, the band width [lambda] is the wavelength range, expressed in nm = 10-9 m, of the peak at half the absorbance maximum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reference substances.

They are provided primarily so that calibration of the method may be performed from time to time and to offer the chance to compare the results when another method is applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The reference substances need not be employed in all cases when investigating a new substance.

This method utilizes a double-beam spectrophotometer which records only the absorption differences between the blank and test solutions to give the spectrum of the chemical being tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Quality criteria--Reproducibility and sensitivity. (A) Reproducibility and sensitivity, need not be measured directly. Instead, the accuracy of the system in measuring the spectra of reference compounds will be defined so as to assure appropriate reproducibility and sensitivity. It is preferable to use a recording double-beam spectrophotometer to obtain the UV-VIS spectrum of the test compound. Such an instrument should have a photometric accuracy of 0.02 units over the absorbance range of 0 to 2 units. It should be capable of recording absorbances at wavelengths of 200 to 750 nanometers nm with a wavelength accuracy of 0.5 nm. The cells employed with the instrument must necessarily be transparent over this wavelength range and must have a path length determined to within 1 percent. To ensure that the instrument is performing satisfactorily, spectra for test solutions of K2Cr2O7 (for absorbance accuracy) and holmium glass (for wavelength accuracy) should be run periodically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reproducibility and sensitivity, need not be measured directly.

Wavelength and absorbance tests should be done as with the double-beam instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of the test procedure--(i) Preparation--(A) Preparation of test solutions. (1) Solutions should be prepared by accurately weighing an appropriate amount of the purest form of the test substance available. This should be made up in a concentration which will result in at least one absorbance maximum in the range 0.5 to 1.5 units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The absorption of a compound is due to its particular chemical form. It is often the case that different forms are present, depending on whether the medium is acidic, basic, or neutral. Consequently, spectra under all three conditions are required where solubility and concentration allow. Where it is not possible to obtain sufficient concentrations in any of the aqueous media, a suitable organic solvent should be used (methanol preferred).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The acid medium should have a pH of less than 2, and the basic medium should be at least pH 10. The solvent for the neutral solution, and for preparing the acidic and basic ones, should be distilled water, transparent to ultraviolet radiation down to 200 nm. If methanol must be used, acidic and basic solutions can be prepared by adding 10 percent by volume of HCl or NaOH in aqueous solution ([HCl], [NaOH]=1 mol/L).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In theory, all chemical species other than that being tested are present in both beams and would therefore not appear in the recorded spectrum of a double-beam instrument. In practice, because the solvent is usually present in great excess, there is a threshold value of wavelength below which it is not possible to record the spectrum of the test chemical. Such a wavelength will be a property of the solvent or of the test medium. In general, distilled water is useful from 200 nm (dissolved ions will often increase this), methanol from 210 nm, hexane from 210 nm, acetonitrile from 215 nm and dichloromethane from 235 nm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Blank solutions. A blank must be prepared which contains the solvent and all chemical species other than the test chemical. The absorption spectrum of this solution should be recorded in a manner identical to that of the test solution and preferably on the same chart. This ``baseline'' spectrum should never record an absorbance reading varying more than 0.05 from the nominal zero value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Cells. Cell pathlengths are usually between 0.1 cm and 10 cm. Cell lengths should be selected to permit recording of at least one maximum in the absorbance range of 0.5 to 1.5 units. Which set of cells should be used will be governed by the concentration and the absorbance of the test solution as indicated by the Beer-Lambert Law. The cells should be transparent over the range of the spectrum being recorded, and the path-lengths should be known to an accuracy of at least 1 per cent. Cells

should be thoroughly cleaned in an appropriate manner (chromic acid is useful for quartz cells) and rinsed several times with the test or blank solutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Performance of the test. Both cells to be employed should be rinsed with the blank solution and then filled with same. The instrument should be set to scan at a rate appropriate for the required wavelength resolution and the spectrum of the blank recorded. The sample cell should then be rinsed and filled with the test solution and the scanning repeated, preferably on the same spectrum chart, to display the baseline. The test should be carried out at 25 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results.
