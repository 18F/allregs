L. 92-552) authorizes appropriations, and confers authority upon the Secretary, subject to such terms and conditions as he deems necessary, and after review by the Marine Mammal Commission, to make grants, or provide other forms of financial assistance, for the purpose of undertaking research relevant to the protection and conservation of marine mammals. Research initiated pursuant to this authorization is to be directed toward increasing the available knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of marine mammals and of the factors which bear upon their ability to reproduce themselves successfully, which information may be used for the purposes of increasing and maintaining the number of animals within species and populations of marine mammals at the optimum carrying capacity of their habitat.</p>
