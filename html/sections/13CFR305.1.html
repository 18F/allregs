                            <p class="depth0">Public Works and Economic Development Investments (``Public Works Investments'') intend to help the nation's most distressed communities revitalize, expand, and upgrade their physical infrastructure (as defined in Sec. 301.11 of this chapter) to attract new industry, encourage business expansion, diversify local economies, and generate or retain long-term private sector jobs and investments. The primary goal of these Investments is to create new or retain existing, long-term private sector job opportunities in communities experiencing significant economic distress as evidenced by chronic high unemployment, underemployment, low per capita income, outmigration, or a Special Need. These Investments also intend to assist communities in attracting private capital investment and new and better job opportunities and to promote the successful long-term economic recovery of a Region.
