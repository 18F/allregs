                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Owners of certain antenna structures more than 60.96 meters (200  feet) above ground level at the site or located near or at a public use  airport must notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register  with the Commission as required by part 17 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise provided herein, a station antenna structure  may be erected at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate  amateur service communications. (State and local regulation of a station  antenna structure must not preclude amateur service communications.  Rather, it must reasonably accommodate such communications and must  constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish the state or  local authority's legitimate purpose. See PRB-1, 101 FCC 2d 952 (1985)  for details.)  [64 FR 53242, Oct. 1, 1999]</p>
