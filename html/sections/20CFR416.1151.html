If a resource is lost, damaged, or stolen, you may  receive cash to repair or replace it or the resource may be repaired or  replaced for you. We do not count the cash or the repair or replacement  of the resource as your income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest on cash for repair or replacement of a noncash  resource. We do not count any interest earned on the cash you receive  for repair or replacement of a noncash resource if the interest is  earned within 9 months of the date you receive the cash. We can extend  the 9-month period for up to an additional 9 months if we find you have  good cause for not repairing or replacing the resource within the  initial period. Good cause exists, for example, if you show that  circumstances beyond your control prevent the repair or replacement, or  contracting for the repair or replacement, of the resource within the  first 9-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary replacement of a damaged or destroyed home.
