                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What time limits generally apply? If you have met the fee  requirements of Sec. 15.110, HUD, in general, will respond within 20  working days after the correct office receives your request. If you have  sent your request to the wrong office, that office will send it to the  correct office within 10 working days and will send you an  acknowledgment letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What time limits apply to requests made on behalf of another  person? The time limits described in paragraph (a) of this section also  apply to requests you make on behalf of another person for information  about that person. However, the time limits will not commence to run  until HUD's receipt of the document signed by that person authorizing  you to request information on his or her behalf. If you make your  request on behalf of another person without including such signed  authorization, HUD will inform you of the authorization needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What time limits apply in unusual circumstances? If you have  requested an especially large number of records, the records are not  located in the office handling the request, or HUD needs to consult with  another government office, HUD will notify you that extra time is  required and provide an estimate of that time. If the extra time needed  is more than 10 working days beyond the general time limit set out in  paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will offer you any opportunity to  limit the scope of your request so that HUD may process it within the  extra 10 working day period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What time limits apply to my request for expedited processing?  If you requested expedited processing, HUD will notify you within 10  working days after it receives your request whether it will grant  expediting processing.</p>
