                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the principles stated in Sec. 776.9, the wage and hours  provisions of the Act apply typically, but not exclusively, to employees  such, as those in the telephone, \29\ telegraph, \30\ television, radio,  \31\ transportation and shipping \32\ industries, since these industries  serve as the actual instrumentalities and channels of interstate and   foreign commerce. Similarly, employees of such businesses as banking,  insurance, newspaper publishing, \33\ and others which regularly utilize  the channels of interstate and foreign commerce in the course of their  operations, are generally covered by the Act. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\29\ Schmidt v.

This would include, for example, employees of a warehouse  whose activities are connected with the receipt or distribution of goods  across State lines. \34\ Also, since ``commerce'' as used in the Act  includes not only ``transmission'' of communications but  ``communication'' itself, employees whose work involves the continued  use of the interstate mails, telegraph, telephone or similar  instrumentalities for communication across State lines are covered by  the Act. \35\ This does not mean that any use by an employee of the  mails and other channels of communication is sufficient to establish  coverage. But if the employee, as a regular and recurrent part of his  duties, uses such instrumentalities in obtaining or communicating  information or in sending or receiving written reports or messages, or  orders for goods or services, or plans or other documents across State  lines, he comes within the scope of the Act as an employee directly  engaged in the work of ``communication'' between the State and places  outside the State. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\34\ Phillips Co. v.
