                                Sec. 779.15  Sale and resale.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 3(k) of the Act provides that ``Sale'' or ``sell'', as used in the Act, ``includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.'' Since ``goods'', as defined, includes any part or ingredient of goods (see Sec. 779.14), a ``resale'' of goods includes their sale in a different form than when first purchased or sold, such as the sale of goods of which they have become a component part (Arnold v. Kanowsky, 361 U.S. 388). The Act, in section 3(n), provides one exception to this rule by declaring that ``resale'', as used in the Act, ``shall not include the sale of goods to be used in residential or farm building construction, repair, or maintenance: Provided, That the sale is recognized as a bona fide retail sale in the industry.'' A resale of goods is not confined to resale of the goods as such, but under section 3(k) may include an ``other disposition'' of the goods in which they are disposed of in a transaction of a different kind; thus the sale by a restaurant to an airline of prepared meals to be served in flight to passengers whose tickets entitle them to a ``complimentary'' meal is a sale of goods ``for resale''. (Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corp., 264 F 2d 831 (C.A. 4), cert. denied 360 U.S. 934.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In construing section 3(s)(1) of the Act as it was prior to the 1966 amendments it should be noted that section 3(n) of the prior Act defined ``resale'' by declaring that this term, ``except as used in subsection (s)(1), shall not include the sale of goods to be used in residential or farm building construction, repair, or maintenance: Provided, That the sale is recognized as a bona fide retail sale in the industry.'' Thus, although section 3(n) of the prior Act also provided the one exception to the meaning of ``resale'', it made clear that the exception was inapplicable in determining under section 3(s)(1) of the prior Act, ``if such enterprise purchases or receives goods for resale that move or have moved across State lines (not in deliveries from the reselling establishment) which amount in total volume to $250,000 or more''. The application of the inflow test under section 3(s) (1) of the prior Act is discussed fully in subpart C of this part.</p>
