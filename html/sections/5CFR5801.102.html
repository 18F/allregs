Once a year, or on a more frequent basis, the Commission will publish and distribute to employees a list of entities whose securities a covered employee or the spouse or minor child of a covered employee may not own.

The positions of these employees are specified in NRC Management Handbook 7.7, which is available in the NRC Public Document Room; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``securities'' includes all interests in debts or equity instruments.
