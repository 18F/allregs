                                Sec. 1.443-1  Returns for periods of less than 12 months.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Returns for short period. A return for a short period, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12 months, shall be made under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Change of annual accounting period. In the case of a change in the annual accounting period of a taxpayer, a separate return must be filed for the short period of less than 12 months beginning with the day following the close of the old taxable year and ending with the day preceding the first day of the new taxable year. However, such a return is not required for a short period of six days or less, or 359 days or more, resulting from a change from or to a 52-53-week taxable year. See section 441(f) and Sec. 1.441-2. The computation of the tax for a short period required to effect a change of annual accounting period is described in paragraph (b) of this section. In general, a return for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period shall be filed and the tax paid within the time prescribed for filing a return for a taxday of the short period. For rules applicable to a subsidiary corporation which becomes a member of an affiliated group which files a consolidated return, see Sec. 1.1502-76.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxpayer not in existence for entire taxable year. If a taxpayer is not in existence for the entire taxable year, a return is required for the short period during which the taxpayer was in existence. For example, a corporation organized on August 1 and adopting the calendar year as its annual accounting period is required to file a return for the short period from August 1 to December 31, and returns for each calendar year thereafter. Similarly, a dissolving corporation which files its returns for the calendar year is required to file a return for the short period from January 1 to the date it goes out of existence. Income for the short period is not required to be annualized if the taxpayer is not in existence for the entire taxable year, and, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the deduction under section 151 for personal exemptions (or deductions in lieu thereof) need not be reduced under section 443(c). In general, the requirements with respect to the filing of returns and the payment of tax for a short period where the taxpayer has not been in existence for the entire taxable year are the same as for the filing of a return and the payment of tax for a taxable year of 12 months ending

on the last day of the short period. Although the return of a decedent is a return for the short period beginning with the first day of his last taxable year and ending with the date of his death, the filing of a return and the payment of tax for a decedent may be made as though the decedent had lived throughout his last taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of tax for short period on change of annual accounting period--(1) General rule. (i) If a return is made for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period, the taxable income for the short period shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying such income by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period. Unless section 443(b)(2) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph apply, the tax for the short period shall be the same part of the tax computed on the annual basis as the number of months in the short period is of 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. (i) If a return is made for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period, the taxable income for the short period shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying such income by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period. Unless section 443(b)(2) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph apply, the tax for the short period shall be the same part of the tax computed on the annual basis as the number of months in the short period is of 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a return is made for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period, the taxable income for the short period shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying such income by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period.

See section 142(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In computing the taxable income of a taxpayer other than a corporation for a short period (which income is to be annualized in order to determine the tax under section 443(b)(1)) the personal exemptions allowed individuals under section 151 (and any deductions allowed other taxpayers in lieu thereof, such as the deduction under section 642(b)) shall be reduced to an amount which bears the same ratio to the full amount of the exemptions as the number of months in the short period bears to 12. In the case of the taxable income for a short period resulting from a change from or to a 52-53-week taxable year to which section 441(f)(2)(B)(iii) applies, the computation required by the preceding sentence shall be made on a daily basis, that is, the deduction for personal exemptions (or any deduction in lieu thereof) shall be reduced to an amount which bears the same ratio to the full deduction as the number of days in the short period bears to 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the amount of a credit against the tax (for example, the credits allowable under section 34 (for dividends received on or before December 31, 1964), and 35 (for partially tax-exempt interest)) is dependent upon the amount of any item of income or deduction, such credit shall be computed upon the amount of the item annualized separately in accordance with the foregoing rules. The credit so computed shall be treated as a credit against the tax computed on the basis of the annualized taxable income. In any case in which a limitation on the amount of a credit is based upon taxable income, taxable income shall mean the taxable income computed on the annualized basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

(i) A taxpayer whose tax would otherwise be computed under section 443(b)(1) (or section 441(f)(2)(B)(iii) in the case of certain changes from or to a 52-53-week taxable year) for the short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period may apply to the district director to have his tax computed under the provisions of section 443(b)(2) and this subparagraph. If such application is made, as provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, and if the taxpayer establishes the amount of his taxable income for the 12-month period described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, then the tax for the short period shall be the greater of the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An amount which bears the same ratio to the tax computed on the taxable income which the taxpayer has established for the 12-month period as the taxable income computed on the basis of the short period bears to the taxable income for such 12-month period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The tax computed on the taxable income for the short period without placing the taxable income on an annual basis.
However, if the tax computed under section 443(b)(2) and this subparagraph is not less than the tax for the short period computed under section 443(b)(1) (or section 441(f)(2)(B)(iii) in the case of certain changes from or to a 52-53-week taxable year), then section 443(b)(2) and this subparagraph do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``12-month period'' referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph means the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the short period. However, if the taxpayer is not in existence at the end of such 12-month period, or if the taxpayer is a corporation which has disposed of substantially all of its assets before the end of such 12-month period, the term ``12-month period'' means the 12-month period ending at the close of the last day of the short period. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a corporation which has ceased business and distributed so much of the assets used in its business that it cannot resume its customary operations with the remaining assets, will be considered to have disposed of substantially all of its assets. In the case of a change from a 52-53-week taxable year, the term ``12-month period'' means the period of 52 or 53 weeks (depending on the taxpayer's 52-53-week taxable year) beginning on the first day of the short period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(a)</em> The taxable income for the 12-month period is computed under the same provisions of law as are applicable to the short period and is computed as if the 12-month period were an actual annual accounting period of the taxpayer. All items which fall in such 12-month period must be included even if they are extraordinary in amount or of an unusual nature. If the taxpayer is a member of a partnership, his taxable income for the 12-month period shall include his distributive share of partnership income for any taxable year of the partnership ending within or with such 12-month period, but no amount shall be included with respect to a taxable year of the partnership ending before or after such 12-month period. If any other item partially applicable to such 12-month period can be determined only at the end of a taxable year which includes only part of the 12-month period, the taxpayer, subject to review by the Commissioner, shall apportion such item to the 12-month period in such manner as will most clearly reflect income for the 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a taxpayer permitted or required to use inventories, the cost of goods sold during a part of the 12-month period included in a taxable year shall be considered, unless a more exact determination is available, as such part of the cost of goods sold during the entire taxable year as the gross receipts from sales for such part of the 12-month period is of the gross receipts from sales for the entire taxable year. For example, the 12-month period of a corporation engaged in the sale of merchandise, which has a short period from January 1, 1956, to September 30, 1956, is the calendar year 1956. The three-month period, October 1, 1956, to December 31, 1956, is part of the taxpayer's taxable year ending September 30, 1957. The cost of goods sold during the three-month period, October 1, 1956, to December 31, 1956, is such part of the cost of goods sold during the entire fiscal year ending September 30, 1957, as the gross receipts from sales for such three-month period are of the gross receipts from sales for the entire fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Commissioner may, in granting permission to a taxpayer to change his annual accounting period, require, as a condition to permitting the change, that the taxpayer must take a closing inventory upon the last day of the 12-month period if he wishes to obtain the benefits of section 443(b)(2). Such closing inventory will be used only for the purposes of section 443(b)(2), and the taxpayer will not be required to use such inventory in computing the taxable income for the taxable year in which such inventory is taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The taxpayer in Example 1 under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section establishes his taxable income for the 12-

month period from January 1, 1956, to December 31, 1956. The taxpayer has a short period of 10 months, from January 1, 1956, to October 31, 1956. The taxpayer files an application in accordance with subdivision (v) of this subparagraph to compute his tax under section 443(b)(2).

Since this tax is less than the tax of $2,790.33, computed under section 443(b)(1) (see Example 1 of paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section), the taxpayer's tax for the 10-month short period is $2,529.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(a)</em> A taxpayer who wishes to compute his tax for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period under section 443(b)(2) must make

an application therefor. Except as provided in (b) of this subdivision, the taxpayer shall first file his return for the short period and compute his tax under section 443(b)(1). The application for the benefits of section 443(b)(2) shall subsequently be made in the form of a claim for credit or refund. The claim shall set forth the computation of the taxable income and the tax thereon for the 12-month period and must be filed not later than the time (including extensions) prescribed for filing the return for the taxpayer's first taxable year which ends on or after the day which is 12 months after the beginning of the short period. For example, assume that a taxpayer changes his annual accounting period from the calendar year to a fiscal year ending September 30, and files a return for the short period from January 1, 1956, to September 30, 1956. His application for the benefits of section 443(b)(2) must be filed not later than the time prescribed for filing his return for his first taxable year which ends on or after the last day of December 1956, the twelfth month after the beginning of the short period. Thus, the taxpayer must file his application not later than the time prescribed for filing the return for his fiscal year ending September 30, 1957. If he obtains an extension of time for filing the return for such fiscal year, he may file his application during the period of such extension. If the district director determines that the taxpayer has established the amount of his taxable income for the 12-month period, any excess of the tax paid for the short period over the tax computed under section 443(b)(2) will be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in the same manner as in the case of an overpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If at the time the return for the short period is filed, the taxpayer is able to determine that the 12-month period ending with the close of the short period (see section 443(b)(2)- (B)(ii) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) will be used in the computations under section 443(b)(2), then the tax on the return for the short period may be determined under the provisions of section 443(b)(2). In such case, a return covering the 12-month period shall be attached to the return for the short period as a part thereof, and the return and attachment will then be considered as an application for the benefits of section 443(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment in deduction for personal exemption. For adjustment in the deduction for personal exemptions in computing the tax for a short period resulting from a change of annual accounting period under section 443(b)(1) (or under section 441(f)(2)(B)(iii) in the case of certain changes from or to a 52-53-week taxable year), see paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments in exclusion of computing minimum tax for tax preferences. (1) If a return is made for a short period on account of any of the reasons specified in subsection (a) of section 443, the $30,000 amount specified in section 56 (relating to minimum tax for tax preferences), modified as provided by section 58 and the regulations thereunder, shall be reduced to the amount which bears the same ratio to such specified amount as the number of days in the short period bears to 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a return is made for a short period on account of any of the reasons specified in subsection (a) of section 443, the $30,000 amount specified in section 56 (relating to minimum tax for tax preferences), modified as provided by section 58 and the regulations thereunder, shall be reduced to the amount which bears the same ratio to such specified amount as the number of days in the short period bears to 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example.

Sec. 1.444-1T  Election to use a taxable year other than the requiredtaxable year (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules--(1) Year other than required year. Except as otherwise provided in this section and Sec. 1.444-2T, a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation (as defined in Sec. 1.441-3(c)) may make or continue an election (a ``section 444 election'') to have a taxable year other than its required taxable year. See paragraph (b) of this section for limitations on the taxable year that may be elected. See Sec. 1.444-2T for rules that generally prohibit a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that is a member of a tiered structure from making or continuing a section 444 election. See Sec. 1.444-3T for rules explaining how and when to make a section 444 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Year other than required year. Except as otherwise provided in this section and Sec. 1.444-2T, a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation (as defined in Sec. 1.441-3(c)) may make or continue an election (a ``section 444 election'') to have a taxable year other than its required taxable year. See paragraph (b) of this section for limitations on the taxable year that may be elected. See Sec. 1.444-2T for rules that generally prohibit a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that is a member of a tiered structure from making or continuing a section 444 election. See Sec. 1.444-3T for rules explaining how and when to make a section 444 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of section 444 election--(i) In general. A partnership or S corporation that makes or continues a section 444 election shall file returns and make payments as required by Secs. 1.7519-1T and 1.7519-2T. A personal service corporation that makes or continues a section 444 election is subject to the deduction limitation of Sec. 1.280H-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A partnership or S corporation that makes or continues a section 444 election shall file returns and make payments as required by Secs. 1.7519-1T and 1.7519-2T. A personal service corporation that makes or continues a section 444 election is subject to the deduction limitation of Sec. 1.280H-1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Duration of section 444 election. A section 444 election shall remain in effect until the election is terminated pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 444 election not required for certain years. A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is not required to make a section 444 election to use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A taxable year for which such entity establishes a business purpose to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (i.e., approved under section 4 or 6 of Rev. Proc. 87-32, 1987-28 I.R.B. 14, or any successor revenue ruling or revenue procedure), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A taxable year that is a ``grandfathered fiscal year,'' within the meaning of section 5.01(2) of Rev. Proc. 87-32 or any successor revenue ruling or revenue procedure.
Although a partnership, S corporation or personal service corporation qualifies to use a taxable year described in paragraph (a)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section, such entity may, if otherwise qualified, make a section 444 election to use a different taxable year. Thus, for example, assume that a personal service corporation that historically used a January 31 taxable year established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, under section 6 of Rev. Proc. 87-32, a business purpose to use a September 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. Pursuant to this paragraph (a)(3), such personal service corporation may use a September 30 taxable year without making a section 444 election. However, the corporation may, if otherwise qualified, make a section 444 election to use a year ending other than September 30 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Required taxable year. For purposes of this section, the term ``required taxable year'' means the taxable year determined under section 706(b), 1378, or 441(i) without taking into account any taxable year which is allowable either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By reason of business purpose (i.e., approved under section 4 or 6 of Rev.

Proc. 87-32 or any successor revenue ruling or procedure), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As a ``grandfathered fiscal year'' within the meaning of section 5.01(2) of Rev. Proc. 87-32, or any successor revenue ruling or procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Termination of section 444 election--(i) In general. A section 444 election is terminated when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A section 444 election is terminated when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation changes to its required taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation liquidates (including a deemed liquidation of a partnership under Sec. 1.708-1 (b)(1)(iv)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation willfully fails to comply with the requirements of section 7519 or 280H, whichever is applicable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation becomes a member of a tiered structure (within the meaning of Sec. 1.444-2T), unless it is a partnership or S corporation that meets the same taxable year exception under Sec. 1.444-2T (e); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An S corporation's S election is terminated; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A personal service corporation ceases to be a personal service corporation.
However, if a personal service corporation, that has a section 444 election in effect, elects to be an S corporation, the S corporation may continue the section 444 election of the personal service corporation. Similarly, if an S corporation that has a section 444 election in effect terminates its S election and immediately becomes a personal service corporation, the personal service corporation may continue the section 444 election of the S corporation. If a section 444 election is terminated under this paragraph (a)(5), the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation may not make another section 444 election for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective date of termination. A termination of a section 444 election shall be effective--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a change to the required year, on the first day of the short year caused by the change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a liquidating entity, on the date the liquidation is completed for tax purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of willful failure to comply, on the first day of the taxable year (determined as if a section 444 election had never been made) determined in the discretion of the District Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In the case of membership in a tiered structure, on the first day of the taxable year in which the entity is considered to be a member of a tiered structure, or such other taxable year determined in the discretion of the District Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the case of termination of S status, on the first day of the taxable year for which S status no longer exists;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> In the case of a personal service corporation that changes status, on the first day of the taxable year, for which the entity is no longer a personal service corporation.
In the case of a termination under this paragraph (a)(5) that results in a short taxable year, an income tax return is required for the short period. In order to allow the Service to process the affected income tax return in an efficient manner, a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that files such a short period return should type or legibly print at the top of the first page of the income tax return for the short taxable year--``SECTION 444 ELECTION TERMINATED.'' In addition, a personal service corporation that changes its taxable year to the required taxable year is required to annualize its income for the short period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume a partnership that is 100 percent owned, at all times, by calendar year individuals has historically used a June 30 taxable year. Also assume the partnership makes a valid section 444 election to retain a year ending June 30 for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. However, for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1988, the partnership changes to a calendar year, its required year. Based on these facts, the partnership's section 444 election is terminated on July 1, 1988, and the partnership must file a short period return for the period July 1, 1988-December 31, 1988. Furthermore, pursuant to

Sec. 1.702-3T(a)(1), the partners in such partnership are not entitled to a 4-year spread with respect to partnership items of income and expense for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1988 and ending December 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for entity that liquidates or is sold prior to making a section 444 election, required return, or required payment. A partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that is liquidated or sold for tax purposes before a section 444 election, required return, or required payment is made for a particular year may, nevertheless, make or continue a section 444 election, if otherwise qualified. (See Secs. 1.7519-2T (a)(2) and 1.7519-1T (a)(3), respectively, for a description of the required return and a definition of the term ``required payment.'') However, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation (or a trustee or agent thereof) must comply with the requirements for making or continuing a section 444 election. Thus, if applicable, required payments must be made and a subsequent claim for refund must be made in accordance with Sec. 1.7519-2T(a)(6). The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(5)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume an existing S corporation historically used a June 30 taxable year and desires to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. Assume further that the S corporation is liquidated for tax purposes on February 15, 1988. If otherwise qualified, the S corporation (or a trustee or agent thereof) may make a section 444 election to have a taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, and ending February 15, 1988. However, if the S corporation makes a section 444 election, it must comply with the requirements for making a section 444 election, including making required payments.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that instead of liquidating on February 15, 1988, the shareholders of the S corporation sell their stock to a corporation on February 15, 1988. Thus, the corporation's S election is terminated on February 15, 1988. If otherwise qualified, the corporation may make a section 444 election to have a taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, and ending February 14, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the new shareholders are individuals. Furthermore, the corporation's S election is not terminated. Based on these facts, the S corporation, if otherwise qualified, may make a section 444 election to retain a year ending June 30 for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987.

However, the corporation did not agree to use a calendar year in the event its business purpose request was denied. On April 1, 1988, the Internal Revenue Service notified the corporation that its business purpose request was denied and therefore the corporation's S election was not effective.

Based on these facts, the corporation may, if otherwise qualified, make a back-up section 444 election as provided in Sec. 1.444-3T(b)(4). If the corporation's business purpose request is subsequently denied, the corporation should follow the procedures in Sec. 1.444-3T(b)(4)(iii) for activating a back-up section 444 election rather than the procedures provided in this paragraph (a)(6 for re-activating an S election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume a corporation has historically been an S corporation with a March 31 taxable year. However, for its taxable year beginning April 1, 1987, the corporation revoked its S election pursuant to section 1362 (d)(1). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, such corporation may retroactively rescind its S election revocation by making a valid section 444 election for its taxable year beginning April 1, 1987, and complying with the procedures provided in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section.

For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the phrase ``deferral period of the taxable year that is being changed'' means the deferral period of the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to make a section 444 election. Furthermore, the deferral period of such year will be determined by using the required taxable year of the taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to make a section 444 election. For example, assume P, a partnership that has historically used a March 31 taxable year, desires to change to a September 30 taxable year by making a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning April 1, 1987. Furthermore, assume that pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, P's required taxable year for the taxable year beginning April 1, 1987 is a year ending December 31.

See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for examples that illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deferral period--(i) Retentions of taxable year. For a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that desires to retain its taxable year by making a section 444 election, the term ``deferral period'' means the months between the beginning of such year and the close of the first required taxable year (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section). The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Example. AB partnership has historically used a taxable year ending July 31. AB desires to retain its July 31 taxable year by making a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning August 1, 1987.

Given these facts, the deferral period of the taxable year to be elected is 3 months (September 30 to December 31) while the deferral period of the taxable year being changed is 6 months (June 30 to December 31). Thus, C may, if otherwise qualified, change to a September 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, by making a section 444 election.

Since the taxable year in issue is not H's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, H may not use the special rule provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) and thus may not retain its May 31 year. However, H may, if otherwise qualified, make a section 444 election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, to change to a taxable year that has no more than a three-month deferral period (i.e., September 30, October 31, or November 30) for its taxable year beginning June 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. I is a partnership that has historically used a calendar year. Sixty percent of the profits and capital of I are owned by Q, a corporation (that is neither an S corporation nor a personal service corporation) that has a June 30 taxable year, and 40 percent of the profits and capital are owned by

R, a calendar year individual. Since the partner that has more than a fifty percent interest in I has a June 30 taxable year, I's required taxable year is June 30. Accordingly, I filed an income tax return for the period January 1 to June 30, 1987. Based on these facts, I may, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, disregard the income tax return filed for the period January 1 to June 30, 1987. Thus, if otherwise qualified, I may make a section 444 election under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section to use a calendar year for its taxable year beginning January 1, 1987. If I makes such a section 444 election, I should follow the special procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.

Sec. 1.444-2T  Tiered structure (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, no section 444 election shall be made or continued with respect to a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation that is a member of a tiered structure on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term ``personal service corporation'' means a personal service corporation as defined in Sec. 1.441-3(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of a member of a tiered structure--(1) In general.

However, see paragraph (c) of this section for certain de minimis rules, and see paragraph (b)(3) of this section for an anti-abuse rule. In addition, for purposes of this section, a beneficiary of a trust shall be considered to own an interest in the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deferral entity--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, the term ``deferral entity'' means an entity that is a partnership, S corporation, personal service corporation, or trust. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated income tax return that is treated as a personal service corporation pursuant to Sec. 1.441-4T (i), such affiliated group is considered to be a single deferral entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the term ``deferral entity'' means an entity that is a partnership, S corporation, personal service corporation, or trust. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated income tax return that is treated as a personal service corporation pursuant to Sec. 1.441-4T (i), such affiliated group is considered to be a single deferral entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grantor trusts. The term ``deferral entity'' does not include a trust (or a portion of a trust) which is treated as owned by the grantor or beneficiary under Subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, of the Code (relating to grantor trusts), including a trust that is treated as a grantor trust pursuant to section 1361(d)(1)(A) of the Code (relating to qualified subchapter S trusts). Thus, any taxpayer treated under subpart E as owning a portion of a trust shall be treated as owning the assets of the trust attributable to that ownership. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, an individual, is the sole beneficiary of T. T is a trust that owns 50 percent of the profits and capital of X, a partnership that desires to make a section 444 election. Furthermore, pursuant to Subpart E, Part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, A is treated as an owner of X. Based upon these facts, T is not a deferral entity and 50 percent of X is considered to be directly owned by A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A is a personal service corporation rather than an individual. Given these facts, 50 percent of X is considered to be directly owned by A, a deferral entity. Thus, X is considered to be a member of a tiered structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anti-abuse rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is considered a member of a tiered structure if the partnership, S corporation, personal service corporation, or related taxpayers have organized or reorganized their ownership structure or operations for the principal purpose of obtaining a significant unintended tax benefit from making or continuing a section 444 election. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a significant unintended tax benefit results when a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation makes a section 444 election and, as a result, a taxpayer (not limited to the entity making the election) obtains a significant deferral of income

substantially all of which is not eliminated by a required payment under section 7519.

See section 702 (c) for rules relating to the determination of gross income of a partner in a partnership.
See examples (3) through (5) in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of testing period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term ``testing period'' means the taxable year that ends immediately prior to the taxable year for which the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation desires to make or continue a section 444 election. However, see the special rules provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section for certain special cases (e.g., the partnership, S corporation, personal service corporation or deferral entity was not in existence during the entire testing period). The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. A partnership desires to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning November 1, 1987. The testing period for purposes of determining whether deferral entities owned by such partnership are de minimis under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the taxable year ending October 31, 1987. If either the partnership or the deferral entities were not in existence for the entire taxable year ending October 1, 1987, see the special rules provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of adjusted taxable income--(A) Partnership. In the case of a partnership, adjusted taxable income for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is an amount equal to the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Aggregate amount of the partnership items described in section 702(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable payments defined in section 7519(d)(3) that are deducted in determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Guaranteed payments defined in section 707(c) that are deducted in determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section and are not otherwise included in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of this section. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of partnership items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, deductions and losses are treated as negative income. Thus, for example, if under section 702(a) a partnership has $1,000 of ordinary taxable income, $500 of specially allocated deductions, and $300 of capital loss, the partnership's aggregate amount of partnership items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section is $200 ($1,000-$500-$300).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> S corporation. In the case of an S corporation, adjusted taxable income for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is an amount equal to the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Aggregate amount of the S corporation items described in section 1366(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable payments defined in section 7519(d)(3) that are deducted in

determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section.
For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of S corporation items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, deductions and losses are treated as negative income. Thus, for example, if under section 1366(a) an S corporation has $2,000 of ordinary taxable income, $1,000 of deductions described in section 1366(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and $500 of capital loss, the S corporation's aggregate amount of S corporation items under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section is $500 ($2,000-$1,000-$500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Personal service corporation. In the case of a personal service corporation, adjusted taxable income for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is an amount equal to the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Taxable income of the personal service corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable amounts defined in section 280H(f)(1) that are deducted in determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rules--(A) Pro-forma rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(iv)(C)(2) of this section, if a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation directly owns any interest in a deferral entity as of the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section and such ownership interest is different in amount from the partnership's, S corporation's, or personal service corporation's interest on any day during the testing period, the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test and the 2 percent gross income test must be applied on a pro-forma basis (i.e., adjusted taxable income and gross income must be calculated for the testing period assuming that the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation owned the same interest in the deferral entity that it owned as of the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section). The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example. A personal service corporation desiring to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987, acquires a 25 percent ownership interest in a partnership on or after October 1, 1987. Furthermore, the partnership has been in existence for several years. The personal service corporation must modify its calculations of the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test and the 2 percent gross income test for the testing period ended September 30, 1987, by assuming that the personal service corporation owned 25 percent of the partnership during such testing period and the personal service corporation's adjusted taxable income and gross income were correspondingly adjusted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reasonable estimates allowed. If the information necessary to complete the pro-forma calculation described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section is not readily available, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation may make a reasonable estimate of such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Newly formed entities--(1) Newly formed deferral entities. If a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation owns any portion of a deferral entity on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section and such deferral entity was not in existence during the entire testing period (hereinafter referred to as a ``newly formed deferral entity''), both the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test and the 2 percent gross income test are modified as follows. First, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation shall calculate the percentage of its adjusted taxable income or gross income that is attributable to deferral entities, excluding newly formed deferral entities. Second, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation shall calculate (on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section) the percentage of the tax basis of its assets that are attributable to its tax basis with respect to its ownership interests in all newly formed deferral entities. If the sum of the two percentages is 5 percent or less, the deferral entities are considered de minimis and are disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If the sum of the two percentages is greater than 5 percent, the deferral entities do not qualify for the de minimis rule provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and thus the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is considered to be a member of a tiered structure for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Newly formed partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation

desiring to make a section 444 election. If a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation desires to make a section 444 election for the first taxable year of its existence, the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test and the 2 percent gross income test are replaced by a 5 percent of assets test. Thus, if on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, 5 percent or less of the assets (measured by reference to the tax basis of the assets) of the newly formed partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation are attributable to the tax basis with respect to its ownership interests in the deferral entities, the deferral entities will be considered de minimis and will be disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upstream de minimis rule. If a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is directly owned by one or more deferral entities as of the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, such ownership is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section the deferral entities directly own, in the aggregate, 5 percent or less of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An interest in the current profits of the partnership, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stock (measured by value) of the S corporation or personal service corporation.
See examples (6) and (7) in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Date for determining the existence of a tiered structure--(1) General rule. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation will be considered a member of a tiered structure for a particular taxable year if the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation is a member of a tiered structure on the last day of the required taxable year (as defined in section 444 (e) of the Code) ending within such year. If a particular taxable year does not include the last day of the required taxable year for such year, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation will not be considered a member of a tiered structure for such year.

Assume that a newly formed partnership whose first taxable year begins November 1, 1988, desires to adopt a September 30 taxable year by making a section 444 election. Furthermore, assume that for its taxable year beginning November 1, 1988, the partnership's required taxable year is December 31. If the partnership is a member of a tiered structure on December 31, 1988, it will not be eligible to make a section 444 election for a taxable year beginning November 1, 1988, and ending September 30, 1989.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume an S corporation that historically used a June 30 taxable year desires to make a section 444 election to change to a year ending September 30 for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. If the S corporation can make the section 444 election, it will have a short taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, and ending September 30, 1987. Given these facts, the short taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, does not include the last day of the S corporation's required taxable year for such year (i.e., December 31, 1987). Thus, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the S corporation will not be considered a member of a tiered structure for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, and ending September 30, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for taxable years beginning in 1987.

Also assume that the partnership was not a member of a tiered structure as of the date it timely filed its section 444 election for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987.

Thus, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, A will be a member of a tiered structure unless under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the S corporations, in the aggregate, own a de minimis portion of A. If the S corporations' ownership in A is not considered de minimis under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, A is a member of a tiered structure and will be allowed to make or continue a section 444 election only if it meets the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

For the taxable year ended September 30, 1987, 10 percent of C's adjusted taxable income (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) was attributable to C's partnership interest in C1. Furthermore, 4 percent of C's gross income for the taxable year ended September 30, 1987, was attributable to C's partnership interest in C1. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, C's partnership interest in C1 is not de minimis because during the testing period more than 5 percent of C's adjusted taxable income is attributable to C1 and more than 2 percent

of C's gross income is attributable to C1. Thus, C is a member of a tiered structure for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that for the taxable year ended September 30, 1987, only 2 percent of C's adjusted taxable income was attributable to C1. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, C's partnership interest in C1 is considered de minimis for purposes of determining whether C is a member of a tiered structure because not more than 5 percent of C's adjusted taxable income during the testing period is attributable to C1. Thus, C is not a member of a tiered structure for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as Example 4, except that in addition to owning C1, C also owns 15 percent of C2, another partnership. For the taxable year ended September 30, 1987, 2 percent of C's adjusted taxable income is attributable to C1 and an additional 4 percent is attributable to C2. Furthermore, for the taxable year ended September 30, 1987, 4 percent of C's gross income is attributable to C1 while 3 percent is attributable to C2. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, C1 and C2 must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether C meets either the 5 percent adjusted taxable income test or the 2 percent gross income test. Since C's adjusted taxable income attributable to C1 and C2 is 6 percent (2 percent + 4 percent) and C's gross income attributable to C1 and C2 is 7 percent (4 percent + 3 percent), C does not meet the downstream de minimis rule provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, C is a member of a tiered structure for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that instead of determining whether C is part of a tiered structure, the issue is whether C1 is part of a tiered structure. In addition, assume that on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the remaining 99 percent of C1 is owned by calendar year individuals and C1 does not own an interest in any deferral entity. Although C in Example 3 was considered to be a part of a tiered structure by virtue of its ownership interest in C1, C1 must be tested separately to determine whether it is part of a tiered structure. Since C's interest in C1 is 5 percent or less, C's interest in C1 is de minimis with respect to C1. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, based upon these facts, C1 is not part of a tiered structure.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as Example 6, except that the remaining 99 percent of C1 is owned 94 percent by calendar year individuals and 5 percent by C3, another partnership. Thus, deferral entities own 6 percent of C1 (1 percent owned by C and 5 percent owned by C3). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, deferral entities own more than a de minimis interest (i.e., 5 percent) of C1, and thus C1 is part of a tiered structure.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. D, a partnership with a September 30 taxable year, desires to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. On December 31, 1987, and the date D plans to file its section 444 election, D is 10 percent owned by D1, a personal service corporation with a September 30 taxable year, and 90 percent owned by calendar year individuals. Furthermore, D1 will retain its September 30 taxable year because it previously established a business purpose for such year. Since D is owned in part by D1, a personal service corporation, and the ownership interest is not de minimis under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, D is considered a member of a tiered structure for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. Furthermore, although D and D1 have the same taxable year, D does not qualify for the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section because D1 is a personal service corporation rather than a partnership or S corporation. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, D may not make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The facts are the same as Example 8, except that D1 is a partnership rather than a personal service corporation. Based upon these facts, D qualifies for the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, D may make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The facts are the same as Example 9, except that D1 has not established a business purpose for a September 30 taxable year. In addition, D1 does not desire to make a section 444 election and, under section 706(b), D1 will be required to change to a calendar year for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, D and D1 do not have the same taxable year for purposes of the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, D may not make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. The facts are the same as Example 8, except that D1 is a partnership with a March 31 taxable year. Furthermore, for its taxable year beginning April 1, 1987, D1 will change to a September 30 taxable year by making a section 444 election. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, D1 is considered to have a September 30 taxable year for purposes of determining whether D qualifies for the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Since both D and D1 will have the same taxable year as of the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, D may make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. The facts are the same as Example 11, except that instead of the remaining 90 percent of D being owned by calendar

year individuals, it is owned 86 percent by individuals and 4 percent by D2, a calendar year partnership. Thus, D, a September 30 partnership, is 10 percent owned by D1, a September 30 partnership, 86 percent owned by calendar year individuals, and 4 percent owned by D2, a calendar year partnership. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, D2's ownership interest in D is considered de minimis for purposes of the same taxable year exception. Since D2's ownership interest in D is considered de minimis, it is disregarded for purposes of determining whether D qualifies for the same taxable year exception provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, since both D and D1 will have the same taxable year as of the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, D may make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. E, a partnership with a June 30 taxable year, desires to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. On the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, E is 100 percent owned by calendar year individuals; E owns 99 percent of the profits and capital of E1, a partnership with a June 30 taxable year; and E1 owns 30 percent of the profits and capital of E2, a partnership with a September 30 taxable year. E owns no other deferral entities. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, E is considered to be a member of a tiered structure. Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, E does not qualify for the same taxable year exception because E2 does not have the same taxable year as E and E1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. The facts are the same as Example 13, except that E owns only 49 percent (rather than 99 percent) of the profits and capital of E1. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, E qualifies for the same taxable year exception because E and E1 have the same taxable year. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, E1's ownership interest in E2 is disregarded since E does not own more than 50 percent of E1's profits and capital.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Prior to consideration of the anti-abuse rule provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, H, a partnership that commenced operations on October 1, 1987, is eligible to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. Although H may obtain a significant deferral of income substantially all of which is not eliminated by a required payment under section 7519 (since there will be no required payment for H's first taxable year), the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (b)(3) will not apply unless the principal purpose of organizing H was the attainment of a significant deferral of income that would result from making a section 444 election.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. F, a partnership with a January 31 taxable year, desires to make a section 444 election to retain its January 31 taxable year for the taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. F is 100 percent owned by calendar year individuals. Prior to the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, F contributes substantially all of its assets to F1, a partnership, in exchange for a 51 percent interest in F1. The remaining 49 percent of F1 is owned by the calendar year individuals owning 100 percent of F. If F is allowed to make a section 444 election to retain its January 31 taxable year, F1's required taxable year will be January 31 since a majority of F1's partners use a January 31 taxable year (see Sec. 1.706-3T). F's principal purpose for creating F1 and contributing its assets to F1 is to obtain an 11-month deferral on 49 percent of the income previously earned by F and now earned by F1. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, F is not allowed to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. The facts are the same as in Example 16, except that F does not create F1 and contribute its assets to F1 until immediately after F makes its section 444 election for the taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. Thus, F is allowed to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. However, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, F will have its section 444 election terminated for subsequent years unless the tax deferral inherent in the structure is eliminated (e.g., F1 is liquidated or the individual owners of F contribute their interests in F1 to F) prior to the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section for subsequent taxable years beginning on or after February 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. The facts are the same as in Example 16, except that F1 is 99 percent owned by F and none of the individual owners of F own any portion of F1. Furthermore, F obtained no tax benefit from creating and contributing assets to F1. Given these facts paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply and thus, F may make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. G, a partnership with an October 31 taxable year, desires to retain its October 31 taxable year for its taxable year beginning November 1, 1987. However, as of December 31, 1987, G owns a 30 percent interest in G1, a calendar year partnership. G owns no other deferral entity, and G is 100 percent owned by calendar year individuals. Furthermore, G's interest in G1 does not meet the de minimis rule provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Thus, in order to avoid being a tiered structure, G sells its interest in G1 to an unrelated third party prior to the date G timely makes it section 444 election for its taxable year beginning November 1, 1987. Although the sale of G1 allows G to qualify to make a section 444 election, and therefore to obtain a significant tax benefit, such benefit is not unintended. Thus, paragraph (b)(3) of

this section does not apply, and G may make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning November 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

In addition, a copy of Form 8716 must be attached to Form 1065 or Form 1120 series form, whichever is applicable, for the first taxable year for which the section 444 election is made. Form 8716 shall be signed by any person who is authorized to sign Form 1065 or Form 1120 series form, whichever is applicable. (See sections 6062 and 6063, relating to the signing of returns.) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a partnership that began operations on September 10, 1988, is qualified to make a section 444 election to use a September 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning September 10, 1988.

Pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1), B must file Form 8716 by December 15, 1988, the due date of the income tax return for the short period September 1 to September 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special extension of time for making an election. If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the due date for filing Form 8716 is prior to July 26, 1988, such date is extended to July 26, 1988. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B, a partnership that historically used a June 30 taxable year, is qualified to make a section 444 election to retain a June 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987.

1988, is required to state on Form 2553 its intention to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Make a section 444 election, if qualified, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Make a ``back-up section 444 election'' as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

If a corporation electing to be an S corporation fails to state either of the above intentions, the District Director may, at his discretion, disregard any section 444 election for such taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D is a corporation that commences operations on October 1, 1988, and elects to be an S corporation for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988. All of D's shareholders use the calendar year as their taxable year. D desires to adopt a September 30 taxable year. D does not believe it has a business purpose for a September 30 taxable year and thus it must make a section 444 election to use such year. Based on these facts, D must, pursuant to the instructions to Form 2553, state on Form 2553 that, if qualified, it will make a section 444 election to adopt a year ending September 30 for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988. If D is qualified (i.e., D is not a member of a tiered structure on December 31, 1988) to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988, D must file Form 8716 by March 15, 1989. If D ultimately is not qualified to make a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1988, D's election to be an S corporation will not be effective unless, pursuant to the instructions to Form 2553, D made a back-up calendar year election (i.e., an election to adopt the calendar year in the event D ultimately is not qualified to make a section 444 election for such year).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that D believes it can establish, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, a business purpose for adopting a September 30 taxable year. However, D desires to make a ``back-up section 444 election'' (see paragraph (b)(4) of this section) in the event that the Commissioner does not grant permission to adopt a September 30 taxable year based upon business purpose. Based on these facts, D must, pursuant to the instructions to Form 2553, state on Form 2553 its intention, if qualified, to make a back-up section 444 election to adopt a September 30 taxable year. If, by March 15, 1989, D has not received permission to adopt a September 30 taxable year and D is qualified to make a section 444 election, D must make a back-up election in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Back-up section 444 election--(i) General rule. A taxpayer that has requested (or is planning to request) permission to use a particular taxable year based upon business purpose, may, if otherwise qualified, file a section 444 election (referred to as a ``back-up section 444 election''). If the Commissioner subsequently denies the business purpose request, the taxpayer will, if otherwise qualified, be required to activate the back-up section 444 election. See examples (1) and (2) in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A taxpayer that has requested (or is planning to request) permission to use a particular taxable year based upon business purpose, may, if otherwise qualified, file a section 444 election (referred to as a ``back-up section 444 election''). If the Commissioner subsequently denies the business purpose request, the taxpayer will, if otherwise qualified, be required to activate the back-up section 444 election. See examples (1) and (2) in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for making a back-up section 444 election. In addition to following the general rules provided in this section, a taxpayer making a back-up section 444 election should, in order to allow the Service to process the affected returns in an efficient manner, type or legibly print the words ``BACK-UP ELECTION'' at the top of Form 8716, ``Election to Have a Tax Year Other Than a Required Tax Year.'' However, if such Form 8716 is filed on or after the date a Form 1128, Application for Change in Accounting Period, is filed with respect to a period that begins on the same date, the words ``FORM 1128 BACK-UP ELECTION'' should be typed or legibly printed at the top of Form 8716.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedures for activating a back-up section 444 election--(A) Partnerships and S corporations--(1) In general. A back-up section 444 election made by a partnership or S corporation is activated by filing the return required in Sec. 1.7519-2T (a)(2)(i) and making the payment required in Sec. 1.7519-1T. The due date for filing such return and payment will be the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The due dates provided in Sec. 1.7519-2T, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 60 days from the date the Commissioner denies the business purpose request.

However, interest will be assessed (at the rate provided in section 6621 (a)(2)) on any required payment made after the due date (without regard to any extension for a back-up election) provided in Sec. 1.7519-2T (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii), whichever is applicable, for such payment. Interest will be calculated from such due date to the date such amount is actually paid. Interest assessed under this paragraph will be separate

from any required payments. Thus, interest will not be subject to refund under Sec. 1.7519-2T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule if Form 720 used to satisfy return requirement. If, pursuant to Sec. 1.7519-2T (a)(3), a partnership or S corporation must use Form 720, ``Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,'' to satisfy the return requirement of Sec. 1.7519-2T (a)(2), then in addition to following the general rules provided in Sec. 1.7519-2T, the partnership or S corporation must type or legibly print the words ``ACTIVATING BACK-UP ELECTION'' on the top of Form 720. A partnership or S corporation that would otherwise file a Form 720 on or before the date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) of this section may satisfy the return requirement by including the necessary information on such Form 720. Alternatively, such partnership or S corporation may file an additional Form 720 (i.e., a Form 720 separate from the Form 720 it would otherwise file). Thus, for example, if the due date for activating an S corporation's back-up election is November 15, 1988, and the S corporation must file a Form 720 by October 31, 1988, to report manufacturers excise tax for the third quarter of 1988, the S corporation may use that Form 720 to activate its back-up election. Alternatively, the S corporation may file its regular Form 720 that is due October 31, 1988, and file an additional Form 720 by November 15, 1988, activating its back-up election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Personal service corporations. A back-up section 444 election made by a personal service corporation is activated by filing Form 8716 with the personal service corporation's original or amended income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is first effective, and typing or legibly printing the words--``ACTIVATING BACK-UP ELECTION'' on the top of such income tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) may be illustrated by the following examples. Also see Example 2 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. E, a partnership that historically used a June 30 taxable year, requested (pursuant to section 6 of Rev. Proc. 87-32, 1987-28 I.R.B. 14) permission from the Commissioner to retain a June 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. Furthermore, E is qualified to make a section 444 election to retain a June 30 taxable year for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. However, as of the date specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Commissioner has not determined whether E has a valid business purpose for retaining its June 30 taxable year. Based on these facts, E may, by the date specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, make a back-up section 444 election to retain its June 30 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, on August 12, 1988, the Internal Revenue Service notifies E that its business purpose request is denied. E asks for reconsideration of the Service's decision, and the Service sustains the original denial on September 30, 1988. Based on these facts, E must activate its back-up section 444 election within 60 days after September 30, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that E desires to make a section 444 election to use a year ending September 30 for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1987. Although E qualifies to make a section 444 election to retain its June 30 taxable year, E may make a back-up section 444 election for a September 30 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Administrative relief--(1) Extension of time to file income tax returns--(i) Automatic extension.

The words ``SECTION 444 RETURN'' should, in order to allow the Service to process the affected returns in an efficient manner, be typed or legibly printed at the top of the Form 1065 or Form 1120 series form, whichever is applicable, filed under this paragraph (c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Additional extensions. If the due date of the income tax return for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, extended as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section,

occurs before the date that is 6 months after the date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation may request an additional extension or extensions of time (up to 6 months after the date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section) to file its income tax return for such first taxable year. The request must be made by the later of the date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) or (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section and must be made on Form 7004, ``Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Corporation Income Tax Return'', or Form 2758, ``Application for Extension of Time to File U.S. Partnership, Fiduciary, and Certain Other Returns,'' whichever is applicable, in accordance with the form and its instructions. In addition, the following words should be typed or legibly printed at the top of the form--``SECTION 444 REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL EXTENSION.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. G, a partnership that historically used a January 31 taxable year, makes a section 444 election to retain such year for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. Absent paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, G's Form 1065 for the taxable year ending January 31, 1988, is due on or before May 15, 1988. However, if G types or legibly prints ``SECTION 444 RETURN'' at the top of Form 1065 for such year, paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section automatically extends the due date of such return to August 15, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that G desires to extend the due date of its income tax return for the year ending January 31, 1988, to a date beyond August 15, 1988. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, G may extend such return to November 15, 1988 (i.e., the date that is up to 6 months after May 15, 1988, the normal due date of the return). However, in order to obtain this additional extension, G must file Form 2758 pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section on or before August 15, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. H, a partnership that historically used a May 31 taxable year, makes a section 444 election to use a year ending September 30 for its taxable year beginning on June 1, 1987. Absent paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, H's Form 1065 for the taxable year beginning June 1, 1987, and ending September 30, 1987, is due on or before January 15, 1988. However, if H types or legibly prints ``SECTION 444 RETURN'' at the top of Form 1065 for such year, paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section automatically extends the due date of such return to August 15, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except H desires to further extend (i.e., extend beyond August 15, 1988) the due date of its income tax return for its taxable year beginning June 1, 1987, and ending September 30, 1987. Since August 15, 1988, is 6 months or more after the due date (without extensions) of such return, paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section prevents H from further extending the time for filing such return.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. I, a partnership that historically used a June 30 taxable year, considered making a section 44 election to retain such taxable year, but eventually decided to change to a December 31, taxable year (I's required taxable year). Absent paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, I's Form 1065 for the taxable year beginning July 1, 1987, and ending December 31, 1987, is due on or before April 15, 1988. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if I types or legibly prints ``SECTION 444 RETURN'' at the top of Form 1065 for such year, paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section automatically extends the due date of such return to August 15, 1988. In addition, I may further extend such return pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No penalty for certain late payments--(i) In general. In the case of a personal service corporation or S corporation described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, no penalty under section 6651 (a)(2) will be imposed for failure to pay income tax (if any) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, but only for the period beginning with the last date for payment and ending with the later of the date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.
