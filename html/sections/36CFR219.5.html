                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Planning for a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other  comparable administrative unit of the NFS is an iterative process that  includes assessment (Sec. 219.6); developing, amending, or revising a  plan (Sec. Sec. 219.7 and 219.13); and monitoring (Sec. 219.12). These  three phases of the framework are complementary and may overlap. The  intent of this framework is to create a responsive planning process that  informs integrated resource management and allows the Forest Service to  adapt to changing conditions, including climate change, and improve  management based on new information and monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assessment. Assessments rapidly evaluate existing information  about relevant ecological, economic, and social conditions, trends, and  sustainability and their relationship to the land management plan within  the context of the broader landscape. The responsible official shall  consider and evaluate existing and possible future conditions and trends  of the plan area, and assess the sustainability of social, economic, and  ecological systems within the plan area, in the context of the broader  landscape (Sec. 219.6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The process for developing or revising a plan includes:  Assessment, preliminary identification of the need to change the plan  based on the assessment, development of a proposed plan, consideration  of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity  to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object  before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan or  plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an  environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The process for amending a plan includes: Preliminary  identification of the need to change the plan, development of a proposed  amendment, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal,  providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment, providing  an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally,  approval of the plan amendment. The appropriate NEPA documentation for  an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental  assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and  scale of the amendment and its likely effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring. Monitoring is continuous and provides feedback for  the planning cycle by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant  conditions over time, and measuring management effectiveness (Sec.  219.12). The monitoring program includes plan-level and broader-scale  monitoring. The plan-level monitoring program is informed by the  assessment phase; developed during plan development, plan amendment, or  plan revision; and implemented after plan decision. The regional  forester develops broader-scale monitoring strategies. Biennial  monitoring evaluation reports document whether a change to the plan or  change to the monitoring program is warranted based on new information,  whether a new assessment may be needed, or whether there is no need for  change at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interdisciplinary team(s). The responsible official shall  establish an interdisciplinary team or teams to prepare assessments; new  plans, plan amendments, and plan revisions; and plan monitoring  programs.</p>
