                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Accepting a request. NMFS will review any request for a  subsidized program submitted to NMFS to determine whether the request  conforms with the requirements of Sec. 600.1005. If the request does not  conform, NMFS will return it with guidance on how to make the request  conform. If the request conforms, NMFS shall accept it and publish a  notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments about the  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Final development plan. After receipt of a conforming request,  NMFS will prepare a final development plan if NMFS determines that the  reduction requested constitutes a realistic and practical prospect for  successfully completing a program in accordance with this subpart. This  includes enabling NMFS to readily design, propose, and adopt a timely  and reliable implementation plan as well as propose and issue timely and  reliable implementation regulations and otherwise complete the program  in accordance with this subpart. NMFS will, as far as possible, base the  final development plan on the requester's preliminary development plan.  Before completing the final development plan, NMFS will consult, as NMFS  deems necessary, with the requester, Federal agencies, state and  regional authorities, affected fishing communities, participants in the  reduction fishery, conservation organizations, and other interested  parties in preparing the final development plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reaffirmation of the request. After completing the final  development plan, NMFS will submit the plan to the requester for the  requester's reaffirmation of the request. Based on the final development  plan, the reaffirmation shall: (1) Certify that the final development  plan meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction amendment, the  requirements in Sec. 600.1002(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Project the date on which the requester will forward any  necessary reduction amendment and, if the requester is a Council,  proposed regulations to implement the reduction amendment. The requester  shall base any necessary reduction amendment on the final development  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determinations about conducting a subsidized program. After  NMFS' receipt   of the requester's reaffirmation, any required reduction amendment, and  any proposed regulations required to implement the amendment, NMFS will  initiate the program if NMFS determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The program meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction  amendment, the requirements in Sec. 600.1002(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The program is reasonably capable of being successfully  implemented;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The program, if successfully implemented, will be cost  effective; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The program is in accord with all other applicable provisions of  the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this subpart.</p>
