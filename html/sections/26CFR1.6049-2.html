                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interest in general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, the term ``interest'' when used in this section and Sec. Sec.  1.6049-1 and 1.6049-3 means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interest on evidences of indebtedness issued by a corporation in  ``registered form'' (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section). The  phrase ``evidences of indebtedness'' includes bond, debentures, notes,  certificates and other similar instruments regardless of how  denominated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest on deposits (except deposits evidenced by negotiable  time certificates of deposit issued in an amount of $100,000 or more)  paid (or credited) by persons carrying on the banking business. In the  case of a certificate of deposit issued in bearer form, the term  ``interest'', as used in the preceding sentence and in paragraph  (a)(1)(vi) of Sec. 1.6049-1, has the same meaning as in Sec. 1.61-7  (regardless of whether taxable to the payee in the year the information  return is made).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts, whether or not designated as interest, paid (or  credited) by mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations,  building and loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead  associations, credit unions, or similar organizations in respect of  deposits, face amount certificates, investment certificates, or  withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Thus, even though amounts paid or  credited by such organizations with respect to deposits are designated  as ``dividends'', such amounts are included in the definition of  interest for purposes of section 6049.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interest on amounts held by insurance companies under agreements  to pay interest thereon. This includes interest paid by insurance  companies with respect to policy ``dividend'' accumulations (see  sections 61 and 451 and the regulations thereunder for rules as to when  such interest is considered paid), and interest paid with respect to the  proceeds of insurance policies left with the insurer. The so-called  ``interest element'' in the case of annuity or installment payments  under life insurance or endowment contracts does not constitute interest  for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Interest on deposits with stockbrokers, bondbrokers, and other  persons engaged in the business of dealing in securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The term ``interest'' when used in section 6049 does  not include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (3),  relating to certain governmental obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any payment by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A foreign corporation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A nonresident alien individual, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A partnership composed in whole or in part of nonresident  aliens,   if such corporation, individual, or partnership is not engaged in trade  or business within the United States and does not have an office or  place of business or a fiscal or paying agent in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any interest which is subject to withholding under section 1441  or 1442 (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and  foreign corporations, respectively) by the person making the payment, or  which would be so subject to withholding but for the provisions of a  treaty, or for the fact that under section 861(a)(1) it is not from  sources within the United States, or for the fact that withholding is  not required by reason of paragraph (a) or (f) of Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a nominee, any interest which he receives and  with respect to which he is required to withhold under section 1441 or  1442, or would be so required to withhold but for the provisions of a  treaty, or for the fact that under section 861(a)(1) it is not from  sources within the United States, or for the fact that withholding is  not required by reason of paragraph (a) or (f) of Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any amount on which the person making the payment is required to  deduct and withhold a tax under section 1451 (relating to tax-free  covenant bonds), or would be so required but for section 1451(d)  (relating to benefit of personal exemptions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any amount which is subject to reporting as original issue  discount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Original issue discount--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``original  issue discount'' when used in this section and   Sec. Sec. 1.6049-1 and 1.6049-3 means original issue discount subject  to the ratable inclusion rules of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1232-3A,  determined without regard to any reduction by reason of a purchase  allowance under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.1232-3A or a purchase at  a premium as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.1232-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordination with interest reporting. In the case of an  obligation issued after May 27, 1969 (other than an obligation issued  pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on May 27, 1969, and  at all times thereafter) and on or before December 31, 1982, original  issue discount which is not subject to the reporting requirements of  paragrah (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.6049-1 is interest within the meaning of  pargraph (a) of this section. Original issue discount which is subject  to the reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.6049-1  is not interest within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions. Reporting of original issue discount is not required  in respect of an obligation which paragraph (b)(2) of this section  except from interest reporting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>; 68A Stat.  917, 26 U.S.C. 7805), and in sec. 309 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 591)  [T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12801, Dec. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6908, 31 FR  16774, Dec. 31, 1966; T.D. 6966, 33 FR 11262, Aug. 8, 1968; T.D. 7154,  36 FR 25011, Dec. 28, 1971; T.D. 7584, 44 FR 1104, Jan. 4, 1979; T.D.  7881, 48 FR 12968, Mar. 28, 1983]</p>
