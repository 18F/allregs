                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of 45 CFR parts 144 through 148, all health insurance coverage is generally divided into two markets--the group market and the individual market. The group market is further divided into the large group market and the small group market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The protections afforded under 45 CFR parts 144 through 148 to individuals and employers (and other sponsors of health insurance offered in connection with a group health plan) are determined by whether the coverage involved is obtained in the small group market, the large group market, or the individual market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coverage that is provided to associations, but not related to employment, and sold to individuals is not considered group coverage under 45

CFR parts 144 through 148. If the coverage is offered to an association member other than in connection with a group health plan, the coverage is considered individual health insurance coverage for purposes of 45 CFR parts 144 through 148. The coverage is considered coverage in the individual market, regardless of whether it is considered group coverage under state law. If the health insurance coverage is offered in connection with a group health plan as defined at 45 CFR 144.103, it is considered group health insurance coverage for purposes of 45 CFR parts 144 through 148.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provisions relating to CMS enforcement of parts 146, 147, and 148 are contained in part 150 of this subchapter.
