This is stayed until March 31, 2016, at which time the total coliform MCL is no longer effective.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (a): As provided in Sec.  142.304(a), small system variances are not available for rules addressing microbial contaminants, which would include subparts H, P, S, T, W, and Y of this part.
