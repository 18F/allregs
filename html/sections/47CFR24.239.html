                            <p class="depth0">Frequencies in the 1850-1990 MHz band listed in Sec. 101.147(c) of  this chapter have been allocated for use by PCS. In accordance with  procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 101.69 through 101.81 of this  chapter, PCS entities (both licensed and unlicensed) are required to  relocate the existing Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) licensees in these  bands if interference to the existing FMS operations would occur. All  PCS entities who benefit from spectrum clearance by other PCS entities  or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must contribute to such  relocation costs. PCS entities may satisfy this requirement by entering  into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than  those specified in Sec. 24.243. However, PCS entities are required to  reimburse other PCS entities or voluntarily relocating microwave  incumbents that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the  alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing  agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed  in Sec. 24.241) from PCS entities that are not parties to the  agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases of  microwave relocation specified in Sec. 101.69 of this chapter. If a  licensee in the Broadband PCS Service enters into a spectrum leasing  arrangement (as set forth in part 1, subpart X of this chapter) and the  spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the  PCS entity responsible for satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under  Sec. Sec. 24.239 through 24.253.  [62 FR 12757, Mar. 18, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 77559, Dec. 27, 2004]</p>
