                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each program or  activity to which this subpart applies so that when each part is viewed  in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped  persons. This section does not require a recipient to make each of its  existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable  by handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance procedures. A recipient may comply with the  requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through acquisition or  redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings,  assignment of aids to beneficiaries, delivery of services at alternate  accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities, or any other method  that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped  persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in  existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving  compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among methods  for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a  recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped  persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Small providers. If a recipient with fewer than fifteen  employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking  its services, that there is no method of complying with Sec.  42.521(a)  other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities,  the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the handicapped person to  other available providers of those services that are accessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section within ninety days of the effective date  of this subpart. However, where structural changes in facilities are  necessary, such changes shall be made as expeditiously as possible and  shall be completed no later than three years from the effective date of  this subpart. If structural changes to facilities are necessary, a  recipient shall, within six months of the effective date of this  subpart, develop a written plan setting forth the steps that will be  taken to complete the changes together with a schedule for making the  changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested  persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing  handicapped persons and shall be made available for public inspection.  The plan shall, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that  limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped  persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  full accessibility under Sec.  42.521(a) and, if the time period of the  transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be  taken during each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to  insure that interested persons, including mentally retarded persons or  persons with impaired vision or hearing, special   learning problems, or other disabilities, can obtain information as to  the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that  are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
