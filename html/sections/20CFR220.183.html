The advance written notice will provide--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A summary of the information the Board has and an explanation of why the Board believes the annuitant is no longer disabled. If it is because of medical reasons, the notice will tell the annuitant what the medical information in his or her file shows. If it is because of the annuitant's work activity, the notice will tell the annuitant what information the Board has about the work he or she is doing or has done, and why this work shows that he or she is not disabled. If it is because of the annuitant's failure to give the Board information the Board needs or failure to do what the Board asks, the notice will tell the annuitant what information the Board needs and why, or what the annuitant has to do and why;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date the disability annuity will stop;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An opportunity for the annuitant to submit evidence within a specified period to support continuance of disability before the decision becomes final; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An explanation of the annuitant's rights to reconsideration and appeal after the decision becomes final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What the annuitant should do if he or she receives an advance written notice.
