                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ACOs or CPOs will budget operation and maintenance (O&M;) funds  for the costs of hiring property appraisers, accident  reconstructionists, expert consultants to furnish opinions, and medical  specialists to conduct independent medical examinations (IMEs). Other  expenses to be provided for from O&M; funds include the purchase of  documents, such as medical records, and the hiring of mediators. See  Sec. 536.53(b). Where the cost exceeds $750 or local funds are  exhausted, a request for funding should be directed to the Commander  USARCS, with appropriate justification. The USARCS AAO must be notified  as soon as possible when an accident reconstruction is indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the claim arises from treatment at an Army MTF, the MEDDAC  commander should be requested to fund the cost of an independent  consultant's opinion or an IME.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The use of outside consultants and appraisers should be limited  to claims in which liability or damages cannot be determined otherwise  and in which the use of such sources is economically feasible, for  instance, where property damage is high in amount and not determinable  by a government appraiser or where the extent of personal injury is  serious and a government IME is neither available nor acceptable to a  claimant. Prior to such an examination at an MTF, ensure that the  necessary specialists are available and a prompt written report may be  obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Either an IME or an expert opinion is procured by means of a  personal services contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), part 37, 48 CFR 37.000 et seq., through the local contracting  office. The contract must be in effect prior to commencement of the  records review. Payment is authorized only upon receipt of a written  report responsive to the questions asked by the CJA or claims attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Whenever a source other than claims personnel is used to assist  in the evaluation of a claim in which medical information protected by  HIPAA is involved, the source must sign an agreement designed to protect  the patient's privacy rights.</p>
