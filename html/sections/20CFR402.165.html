                            <p class="depth0">The following is our fee schedule for providing records and related services under the FOIA:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manual searching for or reviewing of records. When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, we will charge an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, we will compute the hourly rate by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step, adding 16% of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. As of January 5, 1997, these rates were $14, $28, and $50 respectively. These rates are adjusted as Federal salaries change. When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, we will charge the rate appropriate for each.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computer searching and printing. We will charge the actual cost of operating the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Photocopying standard size pages. We will charge $0.10 per page. The Freedom of Information (FOI) Officer may charge lower fees for particular documents where--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The document has already been printed in large numbers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The program office determines that using existing stock to answer this request, and any other anticipated FOI requests, will not interfere with program requirements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FOI Officer determines that the lower fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Photocopying odd-size documents. For photocopying documents such as punchcards or blueprints, or reproducing other records such as tapes, we will charge the actual costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certifying that records are true copies. This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge $10 per certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sending records by express mail, certified mail, or other special methods. This service is not required by the FOIA. If we agree to provide it, we will charge our actual costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other special services. For performing any other special service that you request and we agree to, we will charge the actual costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials used, plus charges for the time of our employees, at the rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Billing exceeds cost of service. Generally we will not charge you a fee when the cost of the service is less than the cost of sending you a bill. However, where an individual, organization, or governmental unit makes multiple separate requests, we will total the costs incurred and periodically bill the requester for the services rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Fee for copies of printed materials. When extra copies of printed material are available, the charge is generally 1 cent per page. If the material may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, the charge is that set by the Superintendent. The Superintendent's address is in Sec. 402.40.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> When not applicable. This fee schedule does not apply to requests for records of Social Security number holders, wage earners, employers, and claimants when the requests are governed by section 1106 of the Social Security Act and by Secs. Sections 402.170 and 402.175.</p>
