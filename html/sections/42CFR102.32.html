                                Sec.  102.32  Benefits for lost employment income.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requesters who are smallpox vaccine recipients or vaccinia contacts may be able to receive benefits for loss of employment income incurred as a result of a covered injury (or its health complications, as described in Sec.  102.31(b)). These benefits are a percentage of the employment income lost due to the covered injury or its health complications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The method and amount of benefits for lost employment income are described in Sec.  102.81. Benefits for lost employment income will be adjusted if there are fewer than 10 days of lost employment income. Benefits provided for lost employment income may also be adjusted for annual and lifetime caps. Payment of benefits for lost employment income is secondary to any obligation of any third-party payor to pay for lost employment income or to provide disability or retirement benefits to the requester. As provided in Sec.  102.84, the Secretary retains the right to recover benefits for lost employment income paid to requesters from third-party payors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary is not requiring an individual to use paid leave (e.g., sick leave or vacation leave) to be paid for lost work days. However, if an individual uses such paid leave in order to be paid for lost work days, the Secretary will not consider the days in which such leave was used to be days of lost employment income, unless the individual's employer restores the leave that was used. By restoring paid leave, an employer puts the individual in the same position as if he or she had not used paid leave on the lost work day (i.e., takes back the payments made when the leave was taken and gives back the leave to the employee for future use).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary may pay benefits for lost employment income to the estate of a deceased smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact as long as such benefits were accrued during the deceased person's lifetime as the result of a covered injury or its health complications and were not paid to the deceased person during his or her lifetime.</p>
