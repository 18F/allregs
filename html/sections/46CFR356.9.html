The prohibition against Non-Citizens owning or controlling more than 25%, in the aggregate, of the interest in an entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel means, for example, that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Non-Citizens that own or control a 25% stake in the ownership entity of a Fishing Industry Vessel at the first tier may not have any interest whatsoever in any entity that is being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-Citizens that own or control less than a 25% stake at the first tier may participate in the ownership and control of other entities that are being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership and control at the first tier. However, the total ownership and control by Non-Citizens of the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel may not exceed 25% in the aggregate as computed by MARAD.</p>
