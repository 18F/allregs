                                Sec. 1605.16  Claims for correction of employing agency errors;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency's discovery of error. Upon discovery of an error made  within the past six months involving the correct or timely remittance of  payments to the TSP (other than a retirement system misclassification  error, as covered in paragraph (c) of this section), an employing agency  must promptly correct the error on its own initiative. If the error was  made more than six months before it was discovered, the agency may  exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct it, but, in any  event, the agency must act promptly in doing so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participant's discovery of error. If an agency fails to discover  an error of which a participant has knowledge involving the correct or  timely remittance of a payment to the TSP (other than a retirement  system misclassification error as covered by paragraph (c) of this  section), the participant may file a claim with his or her employing  agency to have the error corrected without a time limit. The agency must  promptly correct any such error for which the participant files a claim  within six months of its occurrence; if the participant files a claim to  correct any such error after that time, the agency may do so at its  sound discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retirement system misclassification error. Errors arising from  retirement system misclassification must be corrected no matter when  they are discovered, whether by an agency or a participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency procedures. Each employing agency must establish  procedures for participants to submit claims for correction under this  subpart. Each   employing agency's procedures must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employing agency must provide the participant with a  decision on any claim within 30 days of its receipt, unless the  employing agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring  a longer period to decide the claim. A decision to deny a claim in whole  or in part must be in writing and must include the reasons for the  denial, citations to any applicable statutes, regulations, or  procedures, a description of any additional material that would enable  the participant to perfect the claim, and a statement of the steps  necessary to appeal the denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employing agency must permit a participant at least 30 days  to appeal the employing agency's denial of all or any part of a claim  for correction under this subpart. The appeal must be in writing and  addressed to the agency official designated in the initial decision or  in procedures promulgated by the agency. The participant may include  with his or her appeal any documentation or comments that the  participant deems relevant to the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employing agency must issue a written decision on a timely  appeal within 30 days of receipt of the appeal, unless the employing  agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring a longer  period to decide the appeal. The employing agency decision must include  the reasons for the decision, as well as citations to any applicable  statutes, regulations, or procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the agency decision on the appeal is not issued in a timely  manner, or if the appeal is denied in whole or in part, the participant  will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies and  will be eligible to file suit against the employing agency under 5  U.S.C. 8477. There is no administrative appeal to the Board of a final  agency decision.  [66 FR 44277, Aug. 22, 2001, as amended at 70 FR 32212, June 1, 2005]</p>
