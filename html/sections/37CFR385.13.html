                                Sec.  385.13  Minimum royalty rates and subscriber-based royalty
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The following minimum royalty rates and subscriber- based royalty floors shall apply to the following types of licensed  activity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> is the lesser of subminimum II as described in  paragraph (c) of this section for the accounting period and the  aggregate amount of 50 cents per subscriber per month. The subscriber- based royalty floor for use in step 3 of Sec.  385.12(b)(3)(ii) is the  aggregate amount of 15 cents per subscriber per month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standalone non-portable subscription--mixed. Except as provided  in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, in the case of a subscription  service through which an end user can listen to sound recordings either  in the form of interactive streams or limited downloads but only from a  non-portable device to which such streams or downloads are originally  transmitted, the minimum for use in step 1 of Sec.  385.12(b)(1)(ii) is  the lesser of the subminimum I as described in paragraph (b) of this  section for the accounting period and the aggregate amount of 50 cents  per subscriber per month. The subscriber-based royalty floor for use in  step 3 of Sec.  385.12(b)(3)(ii) is the aggregate amount of 30 cents per  subscriber per month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> is the aggregate amount of 50 cents per subscriber per  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Bundled subscription services. In the case of a subscription  service providing licensed activity that is made available to end users  with one or more other products or services (including products or  services subject to other   subparts) as part of a single transaction without pricing for the  subscription service providing licensed activity separate from the  product(s) or service(s) with which it is made available (e.g., a case  in which a user can buy a portable device and one-year access to a  subscription service providing licensed activity for a single price),  the minimum for use in step 1 of Sec.  385.12(b)(1)(ii) is subminimum I  as described in paragraph (b) of this section for the accounting period.  The subscriber-based royalty floor for use in step 3 of Sec.   385.12(b)(3)(ii) is the aggregate amount of 25 cents per month for each  end user who has made at least one play of a licensed work during such  month (each such end user to be considered an ``active subscriber'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Free nonsubscription/ad-supported services. In the case of a  service offering licensed activity free of any charge to the end user,  the minimum for use in step 1 of Sec.  385.12(b)(1)(ii) is subminimum II  described in paragraph (c) of this section for the accounting period.  There is no subscriber-based royalty floor for use in step 3 of Sec.   385.12(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of subminimum I. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(2),  (3), and (4) of this section, subminimum I for an accounting period  means the aggregate of the following with respect to all sound  recordings of musical works used in the relevant offering of the service  provider during the accounting period--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases in which the record company is the licensee under 17  U.S.C. 115 and the record company has granted the rights to make  interactive streams or limited downloads of a sound recording through  the third-party service together with the right to reproduce and  distribute the musical work embodied therein, 17.36% of the total amount  expensed by the service provider or any of its affiliates in accordance  with GAAP for such rights for the accounting period, which amount shall  equal the applicable consideration for such rights at the time such  applicable consideration is properly recognized as an expense under  GAAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases in which the record company is not the licensee under  17 U.S.C. 115 and the record company has granted the rights to make  interactive streams or limited downloads of a sound recording through  the third-party service without the right to reproduce and distribute  the musical work embodied therein, 21% of the total amount expensed by  the service provider or any of its affiliates in accordance with GAAP  for such rights for the accounting period, which amount shall equal the  applicable consideration for such rights at the time such applicable  consideration is properly recognized as an expense under GAAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of subminimum II. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)  and (5) of this section, subminimum II for an accounting period means  the aggregate of the following with respect to all sound recordings of  musical works used in the relevant offering of the service provider  during the accounting period--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases in which the record company is the licensee under 17  U.S.C. 115 and the record company has granted the rights to make  interactive streams and limited downloads of a sound recording through  the third-party service together with the right to reproduce and  distribute the musical work embodied therein, 18% of the total amount  expensed by the service provider or any of its affiliates in accordance  with GAAP for such rights for the accounting period, which amount shall  equal the applicable consideration for such rights at the time such  applicable consideration is properly recognized as an expense under  GAAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases in which the record company is not the licensee under  17 U.S.C. 115 and the record company has granted the rights to make  interactive streams or limited downloads of a sound recording through  the third-party service without the right to reproduce and distribute  the musical work embodied therein, 22% of the total amount expensed by  the service provider or any of its affiliates in accordance with GAAP  for such rights for the accounting period, which amount shall equal the  applicable consideration for such rights at the time such applicable  consideration is properly recognized as an expense under GAAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payments made by third parties. If a record company providing  sound recording rights to the service provider for a licensed activity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recognizes revenue (in accordance with GAAP, and including for  the avoidance of doubt all applicable consideration with respect to such  rights for the accounting period, regardless of the form or timing of  payment) from a person or entity other than the service provider  providing the licensed activity and its affiliates, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such revenue is received, in the context of the transactions  involved, as applicable consideration for such rights,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Then such revenue shall be added to the amounts expensed by the  service provider solely for purposes of paragraphs(b)(1), (b)(2),  (c)(1), or (c)(2) of this section, as applicable, if not already  included in such expensed amounts. Where the service provider is the  licensee, if the service provider provides the record company all  information necessary for the record company to determine whether  additional royalties are payable by the service provider hereunder as a  result of revenue recognized from a person or entity other than the  service provider as described in the immediately preceding sentence,  then the record company shall provide such further information as  necessary for the service provider to calculate the additional royalties  and indemnify the service provider for such additional royalties. The  sole obligation of the record company shall be to pay the licensee such  additional royalties if actually payable as royalties hereunder;  provided, however, that this shall not affect any otherwise existing  right or remedy of the copyright owner nor diminish the licensee's  obligations to the copyright owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Computation of subscriber-based royalty rates. For purposes of  paragraph (a) of this section, to determine the minimum or subscriber- based royalty floor, as applicable to any particular offering, the total  number of subscriber-months for the accounting period, shall be  calculated taking into account all end users who were subscribers for  complete calendar months, prorating in the case of end users who were  subscribers for only part of a calendar month, and deducting on a  prorated basis for end users covered by a free trial period subject to  the promotional royalty rate as described in Sec.  385.14(b)(2), except  that in the case of a bundled subscription service, subscriber-months  shall instead be determined with respect to active subscribers as  defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The product of the total  number of subscriber-months for the accounting period and the specified  number of cents per subscriber (or active subscriber, as the case may  be) shall be used as the subscriber-based component of the minimum or  subscriber-based royalty floor, as applicable, for the accounting  period.
