An  individual requesting access to records pertaining to him in an OGE  Governmentwide system of records should submit a written request, which  includes the words ``Privacy Act Request'' on both the envelope and at  the top of the request letter, to the appropriate system manager as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records filed directly with OGE by non-OGE employees: The Deputy  Director, Office of Agency Programs, Office of Government Ethics, Suite  500, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3917;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records filed with a Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) or  the head of a department or agency: The DAEO at the department or agency  concerned; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records filed with the Federal Election Commission by candidates  for President or Vice President: The General Counsel, Office of General  Counsel, Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC  20463.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records in an OGE Internal System of Records. An individual  requesting access to records pertaining to him in an OGE internal system  of records should submit a written request, which includes the words  ``Privacy Act Request'' on both the envelope and at the top of the  request letter, to the Deputy Director, Office of Administration and  Information Management, Office of Government Ethics, Suite 500, 1201 New  York Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3917.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content of request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request should contain a specific  reference to the OGE system of records from which access to the records  is sought. Notices of OGE systems of records subject to the Privacy Act  are published in the Federal Register, and copies of the notices are  available on OGE's Web site at http://www.usoge.gov, or upon request  from OGE's Office of General Counsel and Legal Policy. A biennial  compilation of such notices also is made available online and published  by the Office of Federal Register at the GPO Access Web site (http:// www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/PrivacyAct.shtml) in accordance with 5  U.S.C. 552a(f) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the written inquiry does not refer to a specific system of  records, it should include other information that will assist in the  identification of the records for which access is being requested. Such  information may include, for example, the individual's full name  (including her maiden name, if pertinent), dates of employment, social  security number (if any records in the system include this identifier),  current or last place and date of Federal employment. If the request for  access follows a prior request to determine if an individual is the  subject of a record,   the same identifying information need not be included in the request for  access if a reference is made to that prior correspondence, or a copy of  the response to that request is attached.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The request should state whether the requester wants a copy of  the record, or wants to examine the record in person.</p>
