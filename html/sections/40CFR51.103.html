                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State makes an official plan submission to EPA only when the submission conforms to the requirements of appendix V to this part and the State delivers the submission to EPA through one of the three following methods: An electronic submission through EPA's eSIP submission system; one paper submission to the appropriate Regional Office with an exact duplicate electronic version, preferably in a word searchable format; or three paper submissions. Any State submission under this part, whether through the eSIP submission system or in paper copy form, will serve as the official submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request by a State, the Administrator will work with the State to provide preliminary review of a plan or portion thereof submitted in advance of the date such plan is due. Such requests must be made to the appropriate Regional Office, and must indicate changes (such as redline/strikethrough) to the existing approved plan where applicable, and be submitted using a format agreed upon by the State and Regional Office. Requests for preliminary review do not relieve a State of the responsibility of adopting and submitting plans in accordance with prescribed due dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to conforming to the requirements of appendix V to this part for complete SIP submissions, the EPA requests that the state consult with the appropriate Regional Office regarding any additional guidance for submitting a plan to EPA.
