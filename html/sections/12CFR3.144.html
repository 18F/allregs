                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements for the SSFA. To use the SSFA to determine  the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a national bank or  Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign  accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section.  Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this  section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts  governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require  payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the  parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more  than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings  association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the  parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk  weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SSFA parameters. To calculate the risk weight for a  securitization exposure using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal  savings association must have accurate information on the following five  inputs to the SSFA calculation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> KG is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal  used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the  underlying exposures calculated using subpart D of this part.  KG   is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an  average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of KG  equal to 0.08).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (vi) of this section to the  balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ninety days or more past due;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the process of foreclosure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Held as real estate owned;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other  than principal or interest payments deferred on:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms  of those guarantee programs; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student  loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions  included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide  for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the  creditworthiness of the borrower; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Is in default.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which  represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated  to the exposure. Except as provided in section 142(l) for  nth-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the  ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are  subordinated to the exposure of the national bank or Federal savings  association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any  reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying  exposures that is subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings  association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation  of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account.  Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which  represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated  to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as  provided in section 142(l) for nth-to-default credit  derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the  current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are pari  passu with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to  credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures.  Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for  securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and  equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, paragraph (d)  of this section, and a risk weight of 20 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization  exposure is less than or equal to KA, the exposure must be  assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization  exposure is greater than or equal to KA, the national bank or  Federal savings association must calculate the risk weight in accordance  with paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When A is less than KA and D is greater than  KA, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent  and 1,250 percent times KSSFA calculated in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section.
