                                Sec.  1602.2  Requests for access to records.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. You may make a request for access to a CSB record about yourself by appearing in person or by writing to the CSB. Your request should be sent or delivered to the CSB's General Counsel, at 2175 K Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20037. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope ``Privacy Act Request.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records sought. You must describe the records that you

want in enough detail to enable CSB personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe they are kept. The CSB publishes notices in the Federal Register that describe its systems of records. A description of the CSB's systems of records also may be found as part of the ``Privacy Act Compilation'' published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. This compilation is available in most large reference and university libraries. This compilation also can be accessed electronically at the Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site (which can be found at http://www.access.gpo.gov/su--docs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agreement to pay fees. If you make a Privacy Act request for access to records, it shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under Sec.  1602.9 up to $25.00. The CSB ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Verification of identity. When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social security number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Verification of guardianship. When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, you must establish:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at your option, the social security number of the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your guardianship; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.</p>
