Following your completion of qualification training under paragraph (b) of this section, you must demonstrate proficiency in collections under this part by completing five consecutive error-free mock collections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The five mock collections must include two uneventful collection scenarios, one insufficient quantity of urine scenario, one temperature out of range scenario, and one scenario in which the employee refuses to sign the CCF and initial the specimen bottle tamper-evident seal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Another person must monitor and evaluate your performance, in person or by a means that provides real-time observation and interaction between the instructor and trainee, and attest in writing that the mock collections are ``error-free.'' This person must be a qualified collector who has demonstrated necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Regularly conducting DOT drug test collections for a period of at least a year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conducting collector training under this part for a year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Successfully completing a ``train the trainer'' course.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schedule for qualification training and initial proficiency demonstration.

If you make a mistake in the collection process that causes a test to be cancelled (i.e., a fatal or uncorrected flaw), you must undergo error correction training. This training must occur within 30 days of the date you are notified of the error that led to the need for retraining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Error correction training must be provided and your proficiency documented in writing by a person who meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Error correction training is required to cover only the subject matter area(s) in which the error that caused the test to be cancelled occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As part of the error correction training, you must demonstrate your proficiency in the collection procedures of this part by completing three consecutive error-free mock collections. The mock collections must include one uneventful scenario and two scenarios related to the area(s) in which your error(s) occurred.
