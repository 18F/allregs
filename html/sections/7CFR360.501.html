                            <p class="depth0">A person may petition the Administrator to remove a taxon from the  noxious weeds lists in Sec. 360.200. Details of the petitioning process  for removing a taxon from the lists are available at http:// www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/weeds/downloads/ delistingguide.pdf. Persons who submit a petition to remove a taxon from  the noxious weed lists would be required to provide their name, address,  telephone number, and (if available) e-mail address. Persons who submit  a petition to remove a taxon from the noxious weed lists are encouraged  to provide the following information, which can help speed up the review  process and help APHIS determine whether the specified plant taxon  should not be listed as a noxious weed:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evidence that the species is distributed throughout its  potential range or has spread too far to implement effective control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence that control efforts have been unsuccessful and further  efforts are unlikely to succeed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For cultivars of a listed noxious weed, scientific evidence that  the cultivar has a combination of risk elements that result in a low  pest risk. For example, the cultivar may have a narrow habitat  suitability, low dispersal potential, evidence of sterility, inability  to cross-pollinate with introduced wild types, or few if any potential  negative impacts on the economy or environment of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> List of references.
