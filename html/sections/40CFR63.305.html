If the alternative standard is disapproved, the Administrator will issue a written notification to the owner or operator within the 60-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable visible emission limitation for coke oven doors and all other requirements in this subpart prior to approval of an alternative standard.

The provision in paragraph (f)(6) of this section is applicable if visible coke oven emissions are observed during periods when pushing emissions have cleared the shed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall not discharge or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere any visible emissions from the shed's control device exhibiting more than 0 percent opacity unless an alternative limit has been approved under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The opacity of emissions from the control device for the shed shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of either paragraph (f)(4)(i)

or (f)(4)(ii) of this section, at the election of the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a continuous opacity monitor, and record the output of the system, for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged from the emission control system.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each continuous opacity monitoring system shall meet the requirements of Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Each continuous opacity monitoring system shall be operated, calibrated, and maintained according to the procedures and requirements specified in part 52 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A certified observer shall monitor and record at least once each day during daylight hours, opacity observations for the control device for the shed using Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator shall visually inspect the structural integrity of the shed at least once a quarter for defects, such as deterioration of sheet metal (e.g., holes in the shed), that may allow the escape of visible emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall record the time and date a defect is first observed, the time and date the defect is corrected or repaired, and a brief description of repairs or corrective actions taken;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall temporarily repair the defect as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days after detection of the defect;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unless a major repair is required, the owner or operator shall perform a complete repair of the defect within 15 days of detection of the defect. If a major repair is required (e.g., replacement of large sections of the shed), the owner or operator shall submit a repair schedule to the enforcement agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the no visible emission limit for the shed specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section is exceeded, the Administrator may require another test for the shed according to the approved test plan as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

In making determinations under these provisions for the side of the battery subject to an alternative standard, the requirement that exceedances be independent shall not apply. During any period when work practices for doors for both sides of the battery are required to be implemented, Sec. 63.306(a)(3) shall apply in the same manner as if the provisions of a plan for a single emissions point were required to be implemented. Exceedances of the alternative standard for percent leaking doors under a shed is the only provision in this section implicating implementation of work practice requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Multiple exceedances of the visible emission limitation for door leaks and/or the provisions of an alternative standard under this section for door leaks at a battery on a single day shall be considered a single violation.</p>
