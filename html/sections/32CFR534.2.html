                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Reporters appointed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 28, are entitled to payment for their services in such capacity at the rates specified in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, or at such lower rates as may be stated in the appointing instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Per diem pay. A reporter is entitled to a per diem payment of not to exceed $5 for each day or fraction thereof in attendance at court. Only one such payment is authorized for any 1 day even if the reporter attends two or more courts. For the purpose of this payment, the day ends at midnight and any fraction will be considered a whole day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hourly pay. A reporter is entitled to an hourly payment of not to exceed 50 cents for each hour, or fractional part equal to or greater than one-half hour, actually spent in court during the trial or hearing. A fractional part of an hour, less than one-half hour, will be disregarded, except that if the total time in attendance in one day or at one court in one day is less than 1 hour, such time will be considered as 1 hour. Time will be computed separately for each day if only one court is attended in such day. If more than one court is attended in 1 day, time in attendance at each court will be computed separately. The hourly pay is in addition to the per diem prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Piece-work pay--(1) Rates. In addition to per diem and hourly pay prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a reporter will be paid on a piece-work basis for transcribing notes and copy work based on the following rates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rates. In addition to per diem and hourly pay prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a reporter will be paid on a piece-work basis for transcribing notes and copy work based on the following rates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transcribing notes and making that portion of the original record which is required to be typewritten--25 cents for each 100 words.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each carbon copy of the record when authorized by the convening authority--10 cents for each 100 words.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copying papers material to the inquiry--15 cents for each 100 words.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each carbon copy of the papers referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section when ordered by the court for its use--2 cents for each 100 words.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Counting number of words. The certifying officer may determine the total number of words by counting the words on a sufficient number of pages to arrive at a fair average of words per page and multiplying such average by the total number of pages. Abbreviations ``Q'' and ``A'' for ``Questions'' and ``Answer'' and all dates such as ``25th'' and ``1957'' will each be counted as one word. Punctuation marks will not be counted as words.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mileage. A reporter is entitled to 8 cents a mile for travel from his home or usual place of employment to the court and for his return journey, computed on the basis of the Rand McNally

Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Mileage is not authorized for return trips each night unless the sessions of the court are held on nonconsecutive days. The fact that a reporter may serve two or more courts in the same day does not warrant a duplication of his mileage allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Allowance in lieu of subsistence--(1) General. When the official of the court having control in such matters keeps the reporter at his own expense away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours or more on public business referred to the court, a per diem allowance of not to exceed $4 in lieu of subsistence will be paid to the reporter for himself. A like allowance when ordered by the court will be paid to the reporter for each necessary assistant. The fact that a reporter returns each night to his home does not preclude the view that he is kept away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours. Service as reporter before two or more courts in the same day does not warrant duplication of the per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.

The time for which the per diem allowance for expenses is to be paid will be computed in the manner prescribed in Sec. 534.3(b)(3) for a civilian witness not in Government employ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Allowance for constructive attendance. A reporter duly employed but who after arrival at court performs no service because of adjournment is entitled to mileage; to a day's pay as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section; and also to the per diem allowance prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section if kept away from his usual place of employment for 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Detail of enlisted members. Enlisted members may be detailed to serve as stenographic reporters for military courts, boards, and commissions, but will receive no extra pay for such service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Persons receiving pay from Government. Compensation for clerical duties performed for a court will not be paid to a person who is in the pay of the Government, except retired military members to the extent permitted under the dual compensation laws.</p>
