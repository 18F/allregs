This 90-day period does not include time that we spend awaiting a response from the tribe for additional information that we have requested. All determinations will be in writing, and all responses will be by certified mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If we find that a plan does not meet the criteria in Sec. 1200.16, we will notify the tribe of shortcomings of the request, and allow the tribe to respond before recommending formal disapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Before final approval, we will reach agreement with the tribe on how many days after final approval we will

transfer the funds. We will transfer the funds as soon after final approval as the tribe or manager is ready to receive them, unless we need additional time to sell existing instruments.
