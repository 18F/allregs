                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The applicant must submit with the application a resource  assessment to provide a basis for assessing the area applied for. This  assessment must include a discussion of mineable and unmineable areas,  taking into account nodule grade, nodule concentration, and other  factors such as seafloor topography. These areas may be delineated  graphically. The resources in the area must be described in relation to  the applicant's production requirements, operating period, and recovery  efficiency in order to justify the area applied for.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The applicant shall select the size and location of the area of  the recovery plan, which area shall be approved unless the Administrator  finds that, among other considerations (see Sec. 971.301(a)), the area  is not a logical mining unit. In the case of a commercial recovery  permit, a logical mining unit is an area of the deep seabed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In which hard mineral resources can be recovered in sufficient  quantities to satisfy the permittee's estimated production requirements  over the initial 20-year term of the permit in an efficient, economical,  and orderly manner with due regard for conservation and protection of  the environment, taking into consideration the resource data, other  relevant physical and environmental characteristics, and the state of  the technology of the applicant set out in the recovery plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Which is not larger than necessary to satisfy the permittee's  estimated production requirements over the initial 20-year term of the  permit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In relation to which the permittee's estimated production  requirements are not found by the Administrator to be unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval by the Administrator of a proposed logical mining unit  will be based on a case-by-case review of each application. The area  need not consist   of contiguous segments, as long as each segment would be efficiently  mineable and the total proposed area constitutes a logical mining unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In describing the area, the applicant must present the geodetic  coordinates of the points defining the boundaries referred to the World  Geodetic System (WGS) Datum. A boundary between points must be a  geodesic. If grid coordinates are desired, the Universal Transverse  Mercator Grid System must be used.</p>
