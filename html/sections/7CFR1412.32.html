                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For any covered commodity on the farm that has base acres (except generic base acres), as adjusted, in excess of zero acres, a current owner of the farm has a one-time opportunity in a specified period, as announced by FSA to update PLC yields on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis equal to 90 percent of each covered commodity's 2008 through 2012 average yield per planted acre, excluding from the average any year when no acreage was planted to the covered commodity. If the yield per planted acre in any of the years 2008 through 2012 is less than 75 percent of the average of the county yield, then 75 percent of the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yield will be substituted for that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The current owner of the farm may retain the counter-cyclical yield as the PLC yield or update the PLC yield, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> PLC yields are exclusively used for PLC. However, any owner of a farm can update the PLC yields, regardless of program election or decision on enrollment or participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A decision by any current owner of a farm to update any PLC yield as specified in this section is final and binding unless that decision to update the yield is withdrawn by that current owner or a different yield update is made by that current owner or another current owner. If that current owner or another current owner requests a different PLC yield update for the covered commodity during the yield update period specified in paragraph (a) of this section that update will become final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All PLC yield updates are subject to review and approval by FSA as specified in Sec. 1412.35. FSA's decision to issue payments based on the PLC yield updated by an owner is subject to verification and spot check by FSA at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Yield updates in this section will be permitted using the current owner's certification of yield. The certification is subject to spot check or verification by FSA at any time. If selected for spot check or verification, the owner must submit evidence specified in Sec. 1412.34 to support the certified yield.</p>
