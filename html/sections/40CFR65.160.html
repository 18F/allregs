Upon request, the  owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records  as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests  performed pursuant to Sec. 65.148(b), Sec. 65.149(b), Sec. 65.150(b),  Sec. 65.151(b), Sec. 65.152(b), Sec. 65.154(b), or Sec. 65.155(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of  this section, as applicable, shall be submitted in the reports of all  subsequently required performance tests where either the emission  control efficiency of a nonflare control device or the outlet  concentration of TOC or regulated material is determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonflare combustion device. Where an owner or operator subject  to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section seeks to demonstrate  compliance with a percent reduction requirement or a parts per million  by volume requirement using a nonflare combustion device, the following  information shall be recorded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For thermal incinerators, record the fire box temperature  measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the full period of  the performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For catalytic incinerators, record the upstream and downstream  temperatures and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed  measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the full period of  the performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For an incinerator, record the percent reduction of regulated  material or TOC achieved by the incinerator determined as specified in  Sec. 65.158(b)(4), as applicable, or the concentration of regulated  material or TOC (parts per million by volume, by compound) determined as  specified in Sec. 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet of the incinerator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For a boiler or process heater, record a description of the  location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or  process heater.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity  less than 44 megawatts (150 British thermal units per hour) and where  the vent stream is not introduced with or as the primary fuel, record  the fire box temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged  over the full period of the performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For a boiler or process heater with a design heat input  capacity of less than 44 megawatts (150 British thermal units per hour)  and where the vent stream is not introduced with or as the primary fuel,  record the percent reduction of regulated material or TOC, or the  concentration of regulated material or TOC (parts per million by volume,  by compound) determined as specified in Sec. 65.158(b)(3) at the outlet  of the combustion device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other nonflare control devices.
