                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service  credit under the System dies in service, or if an annuitant who was a  former participant dies, annuities are payable to a surviving child or  children, as defined in Sec. 19.2(e) as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When survived by spouse and child or children. If a principal is  survived by a wife or husband and by a child or children, in addition to  any other annuity, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each child an  annuity equal to the smallest of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $900</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $2,700 divided by the number of children--adjusted under  paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When survived by a child or children but no spouse. If the  principal is not survived by a wife or husband, but by a child or  children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the  smallest of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $1,080</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $3,240 divided by the number of children--adjusted under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted rates. In order to reflect cost-of-living increases,  the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) are increased from  the commencing date of the annuity to each child by the cumulative  percentage of all cost-of-living increases that have occurred under 5  U.S.C. 8340 since October 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recomputation of annuity for child or children. If a surviving  wife or husband dies or the annuity of a child is terminated, the  annuities of any remaining children shall be recomputed and paid as  though such spouse or child had not survived the participant. If the  annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is  initiated or resumed, the annuities of any other children shall be  recomputed and paid from that date as though the annuities to all  currently eligible children in the family were then being initiated.</p>
