                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disbursement of loan proceeds. The principal amount of any loan  made or guaranteed by the Secretary under this subpart was disbursed to  the entity in accordance with an agreement entered into between the  parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Length and maturity of loans. The principal amount of each loan  or loan guarantee, together with interest thereon, is repayable over a  period of 22 years, beginning on the date of endorsement of the loan, or  loan guarantee by the Secretary. The Secretary could approve a shorter  repayment period if he or she determined that a repayment period of less  than 22 years is more appropriate to an entity's total financial plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Repayment. The principal amount of each loan or loan guarantee,  together with interest thereon is repayable in accordance with a  repayment schedule that is agreed upon by the parties to the loan or  loan guarantee and approved by the Secretary before or at the time of  endorsement of the loan. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the  Secretary, each loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary is repayable in  substantially level combined installments of principal and interest to  be paid at intervals not less frequently than annually, sufficient in  amount to amortize the loan through the final year of the life of the  loan. Principal repayment during the first 60 months of operation could  be deferred with payment of interest only during that period. The  Secretary could set rates of interest for each disbursement at a rate  comparable to the rate of interest prevailing on the date of  disbursement for marketable obligations of the United States of  comparable maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate  administrative charges.
