Under these  circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or  replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and  procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change  of address, the card issuer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notifies the cardholder of the request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the cardholder's former address; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By any other means of communication that the card issuer and the  cardholder have previously agreed to use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides to the cardholder a reasonable means of promptly  reporting incorrect address changes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise assesses the validity of the change of address in  accordance with the policies and procedures the card issuer has  established pursuant to Sec. 222.90 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternative timing of address validation. A card issuer may  satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if it  validates an address pursuant to the methods in paragraph (c)(1) or  (c)(2) of this section when it receives an address change notification,  before it receives a request for an additional or replacement card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Form of notice.

Appendix I to Part 222 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix J to Part 222--Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft</p><p class="depth0">Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation</p><p class="depth0">Section 222.90 of this part requires each financial institution and  creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as  defined in Sec. 222.90(b)(3) of this part, to develop and provide for  the continued administration of a written Program to detect, prevent,  and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered  account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended  to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and  maintenance of a Program that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 222.90  of this part.</p><p class="depth0">I. The Program</p><p class="depth0">In designing its Program, a financial institution or creditor may  incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and  other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to  customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or  creditor from identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk Factors. A financial institution or creditor should  consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for  covered accounts, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Its previous experiences with identity theft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sources of Red Flags. Financial institutions and creditors  should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or  creditor has experienced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or  creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable supervisory guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Categories of Red Flags. The Program should include relevant Red  Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red  Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this  appendix J.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer  reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection  services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The presentation of suspicious documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,  such as a suspicious address change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a  covered account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law  enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity  theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial  institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">III. Detecting Red Flags</p><p class="depth0">The Program's policies and procedures should address the detection  of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and  existing covered accounts, such as by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the  identity of, a person opening a covered account, for example, using the  policies and procedures regarding identification and verification set  forth in the Customer Identification Program rules implementing 31  U.S.C. 5318(l) (31 CFR 103.121); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying  the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing  covered accounts.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft</p><p class="depth0">The Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate  responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has  detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In  determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor  should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of  identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in  unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the  financial institution, creditor, or third party, or notice that a  customer has provided information related to a covered account held by  the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming  to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent  website. Appropriate responses may include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contacting the customer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security  devices that permit access to a covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reopening a covered account with a new account number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Not opening a new covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Closing an existing covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a  covered account to a debt collector;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notifying law enforcement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining that no response is warranted under the particular  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">V. Updating the Program</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions and creditors should update the Program  (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to  reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of  the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on  factors such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with  identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Changes in methods of identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity  theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution  or creditor offers or maintains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Changes in the business arrangements of the financial  institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances,  joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Methods for Administering the Program</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Oversight of Program. Oversight by the board of directors, an  appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the  level of senior management should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assigning specific responsibility for the Program's  implementation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the  financial institution or creditor with Sec. 222.90 of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approving material changes to the Program as necessary to  address changing identity theft risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reports. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Staff of the financial institution or  creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration  of its Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate  committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior  management, at least annually, on compliance by the financial  institution or creditor with Sec. 222.90 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of report. The report should address material matters  related to the Program and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of  the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in  addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of  covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts;   service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity  theft and management's response; and recommendations for material  changes to the Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Oversight of service provider arrangements. Whenever a financial  institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an  activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial  institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of  the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies  and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of  identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could  require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures  to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the  service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the  financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to  prevent or mitigate identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other  related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31  U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with  applicable law and regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h)  regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the  financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to  consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to  correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not  report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is  inaccurate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale,  transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from  identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">Supplement A to Appendix J</p><p class="depth0">In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended  in section II.b. of the Guidelines in appendix J of this part, each  financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its  Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following  illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:</p><p class="depth0">Alerts, Notifications or Warnings from a Consumer Reporting Agency</p><p class="depth0">1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in  response to a request for a consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address  discrepancy, as defined in 12 CFR 1022.82(b).</p><p class="depth0">4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is  inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an  applicant or customer, such as:</p><p class="depth0">a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;</p><p class="depth0">b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;</p><p class="depth0">c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect  to recently established credit relationships; or</p><p class="depth0">d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of  account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Suspicious Documents</p><p class="depth0">5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered  or forged.</p><p class="depth0">6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is  not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer  presenting the identification.</p><p class="depth0">7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with  information provided by the person opening a new covered account or  customer presenting the identification.</p><p class="depth0">8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with  readily accessible information that is on file with the financial  institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.</p><p class="depth0">9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives  the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.</p><p class="depth0">Suspicious Personal Identifying Information</p><p class="depth0">10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when  compared against external information sources used by the financial  institution or creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is  listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</p><p class="depth0">11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not  consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the  customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN  range and date of birth.</p><p class="depth0">12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with  known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party  sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided  on a fraudulent application; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number  provided on a fraudulent application.</p><p class="depth0">13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly  associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third- party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a  prison; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or  answering service.</p><p class="depth0">14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons  opening an account or other customers.</p><p class="depth0">15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or  similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually  large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</p><p class="depth0">16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to  provide all required personal identifying information on an application  or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.</p><p class="depth0">17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with  personal identifying information that is on file with the financial  institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">18. For financial institutions and creditors that use challenge  questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot  provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be  available from a wallet or consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</p><p class="depth0">19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a  covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a  new, additional, or replacement card or a cell phone, or for the  addition of authorized users on the account.</p><p class="depth0">20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly  associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or  merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics  equipment or jewelry); or</p><p class="depth0">b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial  payment but no subsequent payments.</p><p class="depth0">21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent  with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for  example:</p><p class="depth0">a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</p><p class="depth0">b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</p><p class="depth0">c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;</p><p class="depth0">d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in  connection with a deposit account; or</p><p class="depth0">e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a  cellular phone account.</p><p class="depth0">22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably  lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of  account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).</p><p class="depth0">23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as  undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in  connection with the customer's covered account.</p><p class="depth0">24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the  customer is not receiving paper account statements.</p><p class="depth0">25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of  unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's  covered account.</p><p class="depth0">Notice from Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in</p><p class="depth0">Connection with Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or</p><p class="depth0">Creditor</p><p class="depth0">26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer,  a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other  person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in  identity theft.
