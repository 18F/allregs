An ankle joint metal/polymer semi-constrained  cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace an  ankle joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more  planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces and has no linkage  across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that  have a talar resurfacing component made of alloys, such as cobalt- chromium-molybdenum, and a tibial resurfacing component made of ultra- high molecular weight polyethylene and is limited to those prostheses  intended for use with bone cement (Sec. 888.3027).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
