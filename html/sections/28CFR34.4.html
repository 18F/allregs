                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for grants. Any applicant eligible for assistance  may submit on or before such submission deadline date or dates as the  Administrator may establish in program announcements, an application  containing such pertinent information and in accordance with the forms  and instructions as prescribed therein and any additional forms and  instructions as may be specified by the Administrator. Such application  shall be executed by the applicant or an official or representative of  the applicant duly authorized to make such application and to assume on  behalf of the applicant the obligations imposed by law, applicable  regulations, and any additional terms and conditions of the assistance  award. The Administrator may require any applicant eligible for  assistance under this subpart to submit a preliminary proposal for  review and approval prior to the acceptance of an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperative arrangements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When specified in program  announcements, eligible parties may enter into cooperative arrangements  with other eligible parties, including those in another State, and  submit joint applications for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A joint application made by two or more applicants for  assistance may have separate budgets corresponding to the programs,  services and activities performed by each of the joint applicants or may  have a combined budget. If joint applications present separate budgets,  the Administrator may make separate awards, or may award a single  assistance award authorizing separate amounts for each of the joint  applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation of applications submitted under part C of the Act.  All applications filed in accordance with Sec.  34.1 of this subpart for  assistance with part C--National Programs funds shall be evaluated by  the Administrator through OJJDP and other DOJ personnel (internal  review) and by such experts or consultants required for this purpose  that the Administrator determines are specially qualified in the  particular part C program area covered by the announced program (peer  review). Supplementary application review procedures, in addition to  internal review and peer review, may be used for each competitive part C  program announcement. The program announcement shall clearly state the  application review procedures (peer review and other) to be used for  each competitive part C program announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicant's performance on prior award. When the applicant has  previously received an award from OJJDP or another Federal agency, the  applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to such prior  award as reflected in past written evaluation reports and memoranda on  performance, and the completeness of required submissions, may be  considered by the Administrator. In any case where the Administrator  proposes to deny assistance based upon the applicant's noncompliance  with requirements applicable to a prior award, the Administrator shall  do so only after affording the applicant reasonable notice and an  opportunity to rebut the proposed basis for denial of assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicant's fiscal integrity. Applicants must meet OJP standard  of fiscal integrity (see OJP M 7100.1C, par. 24 and OJP HB 4500.2B, par.  48 a and b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposition of applications. On the basis of competition and  applicable review procedures completed pursuant to this regulation, the  Administrator will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approve the application for funding, in whole or in part, for  such amount of funds, and subject to such conditions as the  Administrator deems necessary or desirable for the completion of the  approved project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine that the application is of acceptable quality for  funding, in that it meets minimum criteria, but that the application  must be disapproved for funding because it did not rank sufficiently  high in relation to other applications approved for funding to qualify  for an award based on the level of funding allocated to the program; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reject the application for failure to meet the applicable  selection criteria at a sufficiently high level to justify an award of  funds, or for other reason which the Administrator deems compelling, as  provided in the documentation of the funding decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notification of disposition. The Administrator will notify the  applicant in writing of the disposition of the application. A signed  Grant/Cooperative Agreement form will be issued to notify the applicant  of an approved project application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective date of approved grant. Federal financial assistance  is normally available only with respect to obligations incurred  subsequent to the effective date of an approved assistance project. The  effective date of the project will be set forth in the Grant/Cooperative  Agreement form. Recipients may be reimbursed for costs resulting from  obligations incurred before the effective date of the assistance award,  if such costs are authorized by the Administrator in the notification of  assistance award or subsequently in writing, and otherwise would be  allowable as costs of the assistance award under applicable guidelines,  regulations, and award terms and conditions.</p>
