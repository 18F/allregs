                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em>  and (4) exemptions, whether 75 percent of the annual dollar volume of  the establishment's sales which are not for resale and are recognized as  retail in the industry, such sales will be considered to include all  sales of lumber and building materials by the establishment which meet  all the requirements for such classification as previously explained in  this subpart, but will not be considered to include the transactions  noted in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, which do not meet the  statutory tests:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transactions not recognized as retail sales. (See Sec. Sec.  779.314 through 779.329.) Dollar volume derived from the following is  not made from sales or services which are recognized as retail in the  industry:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracts to build, maintain, or repair buildings or other  structures, or sales of services involving performance of typical  construction activity or any other work recognized as an activity of a  contracting business rather than a function of a retail merchant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales of lumber and building materials in which the seller  agrees to install them for the purchaser, where the installation is not  limited to services that are merely incidental to the sale and delivery  of such materials but includes a substantial amount of activity such as  construction work which is not recognized as retail (for example, sale  and installation of roofing, siding, or insulation). A sale of such  materials which would otherwise be recognized as retail (contracts  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are outside this category)  may be so recognized notwithstanding the installation agreement,  however, to the extent that the sales value of the materials is  segregated and separately identified in the transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales in direct carload shipments; that is, where the materials  are shipped direct in carload lots from the dealer's supplier to the  dealer's customer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sales of specialized goods (some examples are logs, ties,  pulpwood, telephone poles, and pilings). Such specialized items are of  the type which the general consuming public does not ordinarily have  occasion to use (cf. Sec. 779.318 and Mitchell v. Raines, 238 F. 2d  186), and the sales of such items are not recognized as retail in the  industry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sales made pursuant to formal bid procedures, such as those  utilized by the Federal, State, and local governments and their  agencies, involving the issuance by the buyer of a formal invitation to  bid on certain merchandise for delivery in accordance with prescribed  terms and specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sales for resale. (See Sec. Sec. 779.330-779.336.) Examples of  sales which cannot be counted toward the required 75 percent because  they are for resale include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales of lumber and building materials sold to other dealers for  resale in the same form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sales to industrial concerns for resale in any altered form or  as a part or ingredient of other goods;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales to contractors or builders for use in the construction,  repair, or maintenance of commercial or industrial structures or any  other structures not specifically included in section 3(n) of the Act  (Sucrs. de Mayal v. Mitchell, 280 F. 2d 477, certiorari denied 364 U.S.  902; and see Arnold v. Kanowsky, 361 U.S. 388, 394, footnote 10, and  Sec. Sec. 779.335-779.336);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transfers of goods by an employer, who is a dealer in lumber and  building materials and who also acts in the capacity of a building  contractor or speculative builder, from or through his building  materials establishment to his building business for the construction  maintenance, or repair of commercial property or any other property not  excepted in section 3(n) of the Act. (See Sec. 779.336.)</p>
