                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After October 30, 1992, each unit  covered by this subpart must be equipped with at least one battery- operated or hard-wired smoke detector, or such greater number as may be  required by state or local codes, in working condition, on each level of  the unit. In units occupied by hearing-impaired residents, smoke  detectors must be hard-wired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After October 30, 1992, the public areas of all housing covered  by this subpart must be equipped with a sufficient number, but not less  than one for each area, of battery-operated or hard-wired smoke  detectors to serve as adequate warning of fire. Public areas include,  but are not limited to, laundry rooms, community rooms, day care  centers, hallways, stairwells, and other common areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptability criteria. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The smoke detector for each  individual unit must be located, to the extent practicable, in a hallway  adjacent to the bedroom or bedrooms. In units occupied by hearing- impaired residents, hard-wired smoke detectors must be connected to an  alarm system designed for hearing-impaired persons and installed in the  bedroom or bedrooms occupied by the hearing-impaired residents.  Individual units that are jointly occupied by both hearing and hearing- impaired residents must be equipped with both audible and visual types  of alarm devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If needed, battery-operated smoke detectors, except in units  occupied by hearing-impaired residents, may be installed as a temporary  measure where no detectors are present in a unit. Temporary battery- operated smoke detectors must be replaced with hard-wired electric smoke  detectors in the normal course of a PHA's planned CIAP or CGP program to  meet the required HUD Modernization Standards or state or local codes,  whichever standard is stricter. Smoke detectors for units occupied by  hearing-impaired residents must be installed in accordance with the  acceptability criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Funding. PHAs shall use operating funds to provide battery- operated smoke detectors in units that do not have any smoke detector in  place. If operating funds or reserves are insufficient to accomplish  this, PHAs may apply for emergency CIAP funding. The PHAs may apply for  CIAP or CGP funds to replace battery-operated smoke detectors with hard- wired smoke detectors in the normal course of a planned modernization  program.</p>
