Grants of highway right-of-way under this subpart may include an appropriation and release to the State or its nominee of all rights of the United States, as owner of underlying and abutting lands, to cross over or gain access to the highway from its lands crossed by or abutting the right-of-way, subject to such terms and conditions and for such duration as the authorized officer of the National Park Service deems appropriate.</p>
