businesses which participate in the Federal-aid highway program as a minority business enterprise (MBE), women business enterprise (WBE), or disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE), all defined under 49 CFR part 23. This expanded definition is used only in this subpart as a simplified way of defining the firms eligible to benefit from this supportive services program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supportive Services means those services and activities provided in connection with minority business enterprise programs which are designed to increase the total number of minority businesses active in the highway program and contribute to the growth and eventual self-sufficiency of individual minority businesses so that such businesses may achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for contracts and subcontracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State highway agency means that department, commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for highway construction. The term State is considered equivalent to State highway agency if the context so implies.</p>
