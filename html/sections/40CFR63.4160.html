Sec. 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166, and establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4092 no later than the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.4083.

If the compliance date occurs on any

day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next month. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to Sec. Sec. 63.4164, 63.4165, and 63.4166; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to Sec. 63.4161(h); calculations according to Sec. 63.4161 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in Sec. 63.4090(a); the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by Sec. 63.4168; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by Sec. 63.4093.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New and reconstructed affected sources.

Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
