                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> through (6) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface coating is the application of coating to a substrate  using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks. When application of coating  to a substrate occurs, then surface coating also includes associated  activities, such as surface preparation, cleaning, mixing, and storage.  However, these activities do not comprise surface coating if they are  not directly related to the application of the coating. Coating  application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up  markers, marking pens, or the application of paper film or plastic film  which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the manufacturer are not  coating operations for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The general use coating subcategory includes all surface coating  operations that are not high performance, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal,  or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The high performance coating subcategory includes surface  coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the  definition of high performance architectural coating or high temperature  coating in Sec. 63.3981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The magnet wire coating subcategory includes surface coating  operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of  magnet wire coatings in Sec. 63.3981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rubber-to-metal coatings subcategory includes surface  coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the  definition of rubber-to-metal coatings in Sec. 63.3981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings subcategory  includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings  that meet the definition of extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings  in Sec. 63.3981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new,  reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in Sec. 63.3882,  that uses 946 liters (250 gallons (gal)) per year, or more, of coatings  that contain hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in the surface coating of  miscellaneous metal parts and products defined in paragraph (a) of this  section; and that is a major source, is located at a major source, or is  part of a major source of emissions of HAP. A major source of HAP  emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources  located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or  has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07   megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a  rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year. You do not need to include  coatings that meet the definition of non-HAP coating contained in Sec.  63.3981 in determining whether you use 946 liters (250 gal) per year, or  more, of coatings in the surface coating of miscellaneous metal parts  and products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through  (17) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A coating operation conducted at a facility where the facility  uses only coatings, thinners and other additives, and cleaning materials  that contain no organic HAP, as determined according to Sec.  63.3941(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface coating operations that occur at research or laboratory  facilities, or is part of janitorial, building, and facility maintenance  operations, or that occur at hobby shops that are operated for  noncommercial purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coatings used in volumes of less than 189 liters (50 gal) per  year, provided that the total volume of coatings exempt under this  paragraph does not exceed 946 liters (250 gal) per year at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The surface coating of metal parts and products performed on- site at installations owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the  United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any  such State) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the  surface coating of military munitions manufactured by or for the Armed  Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National  Guard of any such State).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Surface coating where plastic is extruded onto metal wire or  cable or metal parts or products to form a coating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Surface coating of metal components of wood furniture that meet  the applicability criteria for wood furniture manufacturing (subpart JJ  of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Surface coating of metal components of large appliances that  meet the applicability criteria for large appliance surface coating  (subpart NNNN of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Surface coating of metal components of metal furniture that meet  the applicability criteria for metal furniture surface coating (subpart  RRRR of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Surface coating of metal components of wood building products  that meet the applicability criteria for wood building products surface  coating (subpart QQQQ of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Surface coating of metal components of aerospace vehicles that  meet the applicability criteria for aerospace manufacturing and rework  (40 CFR part 63, subpart GG).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Surface coating of metal parts intended for use in an aerospace  vehicle or component using specialty coatings as defined in appendix A  to subpart GG of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Surface coating of metal components of ships that meet the  applicability criteria for shipbuilding and ship repair (subpart II of  this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Surface coating of metal using a web coating process that meets  the applicability criteria for paper and other web coating (subpart JJJJ  of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Surface coating of metal using a coil coating process that  meets the applicability criteria for metal coil coating (subpart SSSS of  this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Surface coating of boats or metal parts of boats (including,  but not limited to, the use of assembly adhesives) where the facility  meets the applicability criteria for boat manufacturing facilities  (subpart VVVV of this part), except where the surface coating of the  boat is a metal coating operation performed on personal watercraft or  parts of personal watercraft. This subpart does apply to metal coating  operations performed on personal watercraft and parts of personal  watercraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Surface coating of assembled on-road vehicles that meet the  applicability criteria for the assembled on-road vehicle subcategory in  plastic parts and products surface coating (40 CFR part 63, subpart  PPPP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Surface coating of metal components of automobiles and light- duty trucks that meets the applicability criteria in Sec. 63.3082(b)  for the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40  CFR part 63,   subpart IIII) at a facility that meets the applicability criteria in  Sec. 63.3081(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If your facility meets the applicability criteria in Sec.  63.3081(b) of the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks  NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII), and you perform surface coating  of metal parts or products that meets both the applicability criteria in  Sec. 63.3082(c) and the applicability criteria of the Surface Coating  of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products (40 CFR part 63, subpart  MMMM), then for the surface coating of any or all of your metal parts or  products that meets the applicability criteria in Sec. 63.3082(c), you  may choose to comply with the requirements of subpart IIII of this part  in lieu of complying with the Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal  Parts and Products NESHAP. Surface coating operations on metal parts or  products (e.g., parts for motorcycles or lawnmowers) not intended for  use in automobiles, light-duty trucks, or other motor vehicles as  defined in Sec. 63.3176 cannot be made part of your affected source  under subpart IIII of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em>, (2), or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may have each surface coating operation that meets the  applicability criteria of a separate NESHAP comply with that NESHAP  separately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section. However, you  may not establish high performance, rubber-to-metal, or extreme  performance fluoropolymer coating operations as the predominant  activity. You must not consider any surface coating activity that is  subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks  NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in determining the predominant  surface coating activity at your facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a surface coating operation accounts for 90 percent or more  of the surface coating activity at your facility (that is, the  predominant activity), then compliance with the emission limitations of  the predominant activity for all surface coating operations constitutes  compliance with these and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. In  determining predominant activity, you must include coating activities  that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP and  constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities at your  facility. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of  other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of coating  activities need not be included in the determination of predominant  activity but must be included in the compliance calculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must use liters (gal) of solids used as a measure of  relative surface coating activity over a representative period of  operation. You may estimate the relative volume of coating solids used  from parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content  (e.g., design specifications for the parts or products coated and the  number of items produced). The determination of predominant activity  must accurately reflect current and projected coating operations and  must be verifiable through appropriate documentation. The use of  parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content must  be approved by the Administrator. You may use data for any reasonable  time period of at least 1 year in determining the relative amount of  coating activity, as long as they represent the way the source will  continue to operate in the future and are approved by the Administrator.  You must determine the predominant activity at your facility and submit  the results of that determination with the initial notification required  by Sec. 63.3910(b). You must also determine predominant activity  annually and include the determination in the next semi-annual  compliance report required by Sec. 63.3920(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may comply with a facility-specific emission limit  calculated from the relative amount of coating activity   that is subject to each emission limit. If you elect to comply using the  facility-specific emission limit alternative, then compliance with the  facility-specific emission limit and the emission limitations in this  subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with  this and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. The procedures for  calculating the facility-specific emission limit are specified in Sec.  63.3890. In calculating a facility-specific emission limit, you must  include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other  surface coating NESHAP and constitute more than 1 percent of total  coating activities at your facility. You must not consider any surface  coating activity that is subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles  and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in  determining a facility-specific emission limit for your facility.  Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface  coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of total coating  activities need not be included in the calculation of the facility- specific emission limit but must be included in the compliance  calculations.
