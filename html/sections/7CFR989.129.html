                            <p class="depth0">Any person (defined in Sec. 989.3 as an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business unit) who is engaged, in a proprietary capacity, in the production of grapes which are sun-dried or dehydrated by artificial means to produce raisins and who qualifies under the provisions of Sec. 989.29(b)(2) shall be eligible to cast one vote for a nominee for each producer member position and one vote for a nominee for each producer alternate member position on the committee which is to be filled for his district. Such person must be the one who or which: (a) Owns and farms land resulting in his or its ownership of such grapes produced thereon; (b) rents and farms land, resulting in his or its ownership of all or a portion of such grapes produced thereon; or (c) owns land which he or it does not farm and, as rental for such land, obtains the ownership of a portion of such grapes or the raisins. In this connection, a partnership shall be deemed to include two or more persons (including a husband and wife) with respect to land the title to which, or leasehold interest in which, is vested in them as tenants in common, joint tenants, or under community property laws, as community property. In a landlord-tenant relationship, wherein each of the parties is a producer, each such producer shall be entitled to one vote for a nominee for each producer member position and one vote for each producer alternate member position. Hence, where two persons operate land as landlord and tenant on a share-crop basis, each person is entitled to one vote for each such position to be filled. Where land is leased on a cash rental basis, only the person who is the tenant or cash renter (producer) is entitled to vote. A partnership or corporation, when eligible, is entitled to cast only one vote for a nominee for each producer position to be filled in its district.
