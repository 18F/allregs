                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each lift device control must be designed so that the pilots can  place the device in any takeoff, en route, approach, or landing position  established under Sec. 25.101(d). Lift and drag devices must maintain  the selected positions, except for movement produced by an automatic  positioning or load limiting device, without further attention by the  pilots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each lift and drag device control must be designed and located  to make inadvertent operation improbable. Lift and drag devices intended  for ground operation only must have means to prevent the inadvertant  operation of their controls in flight if that operation could be  hazardous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rate of motion of the surfaces in response to the operation  of the control and the characteristics of the automatic positioning or  load limiting device must give satisfactory flight and performance  characteristics under steady or changing conditions of airspeed, engine  power, and airplane attitude.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The lift device control must be designed to retract the surfaces  from the fully extended position, during steady flight at maximum  continuous engine power at any speed below VF +9.0 (knots).
