                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>, every national bank, state member bank, and insured  state nonmember bank is required to file Consolidated Reports of  Condition and Income (also known as the Call Report) in accordance with  the instructions for these reports. All assets and liabilities,  including contingent assets and liabilities, must be reported in, or  otherwise taken into account in the preparation of, the Call Report. The  FDIC uses Call Report data to calculate deposit insurance assessments  and monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual  banks and the banking industry. Reporting banks must also submit  annually such information on small business and small farm lending as  the FDIC may need to assess the availability of credit to these sectors  of the economy. The report forms and instructions can be obtained from  the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC), FDIC,  Washington, DC 20429.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  3064-0052)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies  of Foreign Banks, Form FFIEC 002. Pursuant to section 7(a) of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(a)), every insured U.S.  branch of a foreign bank is required to file a Report of Assets and  Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks in accordance  with the instructions for the report. All assets and liabilities,  including contingent assets and liabilities, must be reported in, or  otherwise taken into account in the preparation of the report. The FDIC  uses the reported data to calculate deposit insurance assessments and  monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual  insured branches and the banking industry. Insured branches must also  submit annually such information on small business and small farm  lending as the FDIC may need to assess the availability of credit to  these sectors of the economy. Because the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System collects and processes this report on behalf of  the FDIC, the report forms and instructions can be obtained from Federal  Reserve District Banks or through the web site of the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council, http://www.ffiec.gov/.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  7100-0032)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Summary of Deposits, Form FDIC 8020/05. Form 8020/05 is a report  on the amount of deposits for each authorized office of an insured bank  with branches; unit banks do not report.

The report forms and the instructions for completing the reports will be  furnished to all such banks by, or may be obtained upon request from,  the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC), FDIC, 550  17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  3064-0061)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification of Performance of Bank Services, Form FDIC 6120/06.  Pursuant to Section 7 of the Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1867),  as amended, FDIC supervised banks must notify the agency about the  existence of a service relationship within thirty days after the making  of the contract or the performance of the service, whichever occurs  first.

The form contains identification, location and contact information for  the bank, the servicer, and a description of the services provided. In  lieu of the form, notification may be provided by letter. Either the   form or the letter containing the notice information must be submitted  to the regional director--Division of Supervision and Consumer  Protection (DSC) of the region in which the bank's main office is  located.
