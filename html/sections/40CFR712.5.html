                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Report on TSCA-regulable quantities. Unless specifically otherwise required, respondents must report only about quantities of a chemical that is defined as a chemical substance under TSCA section 3(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Chemicals from natural sources. A manufacturer of a chemical substance which is extracted from an ore, from oil, or from any other natural source must report only about the manufacturing steps for, and the uses of, that chemical, not about production of the natural source material or other crude precursors derived from the natural source material.</p><p class="depth2">For example, persons who manufacture a chemical substance such as ``sweetened naphtha, 64741-87-3,'' but do not refine the naphtha to produce ``hexane, 110-54-3'' would not report on hexane. Only the production of ``hexane'' as an isolated product must be reported--not previous production of more crude, complex substances such as naphtha from which hexane is extracted. Thus, persons who produce crude oil, ores, and other crude natural materials, but do not carry them through further manufacturing steps that produce a listed chemical have no reporting responsibilities under this Part. Note, however, that any method of extraction, refinement, or purification of a listed chemical substance is considered to be manufacturing for the purposes of this rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Chemical substances as marketed. This part requires reporting about chemical substances as they are marketed or used in practice. The following preparations of a chemical substance must be reported as the substance itself, not as a mixture, since these preparations are regarded as the substance in practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance in aqueous solution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The chemical substance containing an additive (such as a stabilizer or other chemical) to maintain the integrity or physical form of the substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The chemical substance in any grade of purity.</p>
