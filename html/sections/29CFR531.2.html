                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term ``wage'' to include the  ``reasonable cost'', as determined by the Secretary of Labor, to an  employer of furnishing any employee with board, lodging, or other  facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily  furnished by the employer to his employees. In addition, section 3(m)  gives the Secretary authority to determine the ``fair value.'' of such  facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to groups of  employers similarly situated, on average value to groups of employees,  or other appropriate measures of ``fair value.'' Whenever so determined  and when applicable and pertinent, the ``fair value'' of the facilities  involved shall be includable as part of ``wages'' instead of the actual  measure of the costs of those facilities. The section provides, however,  that the cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be  included as part of ``wages'' if excluded therefrom by a bona fide  collective bargaining agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for  determining the wage of a tipped employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part 531 contains any determinations made as to the  ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value'' of board, lodging, or other  facilities having general application, and describes the procedure  whereby determinations having general or particular application may be  made. The part also interprets generally the provisions of section 3(m)  of the Act, including the term ``tipped employee'' as defined in section  3(t).</p>
