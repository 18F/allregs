                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Upon the request of any person submitted in accordance with subpart B of this part, the disclosure officer shall make any document (or portion thereof) from the records of the PBGC in the custody of any official of the PBGC available for inspection and copying unless exempt from disclosure under the provisions of subsection (b) of FOIA and subpart C of this part. The subpart B procedures must be used for records that are not made available in the PBGC's public reference room under Sec. 4901.4 and may be used for records that are available in the public reference room. Records that could be produced only by manipulation of existing information (such as computer analyses of existing data), thus creating information not previously in being, are not records of the PBGC and are not required to be furnished under FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Discretionary disclosure. Notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption under subsection (b) of FOIA and subpart C of this part (other than an exemption under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of FOIA and Sec. 4901.21 (a)(2) and (a)(3)), the disclosure officer may (subject to 18 U.S.C. 1905 and Sec. 4901.21(a)(1)) make any document (or portion thereof) from the records of the PBGC available for inspection and copying if the disclosure officer determines that disclosure furthers the public interest and does not impede the discharge of any of the functions of the PBGC.</p>
