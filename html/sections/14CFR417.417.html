Appendix A to Part 417--Flight Safety Analysis Methodologies and</p><p class="depth0">Products for a Launch Vehicle Flown With a Flight Safety System</p><p class="depth0">A417.1 Scope</p><p class="depth0">The requirements of this appendix apply to the methods for performing the flight safety analysis required by Sec. 417.107(f) and subpart C of this part. The methodologies contained in this appendix provide an acceptable means of satisfying the requirements of subpart C and provide a standard and a measure of fidelity against which the FAA will measure any proposed alternative analysis approach. This

appendix also identifies the analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by Sec. 417.203(e).</p><p class="depth0">A417.3 Applicability</p><p class="depth0">The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's flight safety analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety. If a Federal launch range performs the launch operator's analysis, Sec. 417.203(d) applies. Section A417.33 applies to the flight of any unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system. All other sections of this appendix apply to the flight of any launch vehicle required to use a flight safety system as required by Sec. 417.107(a). For any alternative flight safety system approved by the FAA as required by Sec. 417.301(b), the FAA will determine the applicability of this appendix during the licensing process.</p><p class="depth0">A417.5 General</p><p class="depth0">A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the requirements for public risk management and the requirements for the compatibility of the input and output of dependent analyses of Sec. 417.205.</p><p class="depth0">A417.7 Trajectory</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 417.207. This section applies to the computation of each of the trajectories required by Sec. 417.207 and to each trajectory analysis product that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by Sec. 417.203(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Wind standards. A trajectory analysis must incorporate wind data in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each launch, a trajectory analysis must produce ''with-wind'' launch vehicle trajectories pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section and do so using composite wind profiles for the month that the launch will take place or composite wind profiles that are as severe or more severe than the winds for the month that the launch will take place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A composite wind profile used for the trajectory analysis must have a cumulative percentile frequency that represents wind conditions that are at least as severe as the worst wind conditions under which flight would be attempted for purposes of achieving the launch operator's mission. These worst wind conditions must account for the launch vehicle's ability to operate normally in the presence of wind and accommodate any flight safety limit constraints.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nominal trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a nominal trajectory that describes a launch vehicle's flight path, position and velocity, where all vehicle aerodynamic parameters are as expected, all vehicle internal and external systems perform exactly as planned, and no external perturbing influences other than atmospheric drag and gravity affect the launch vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dispersed trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce the following dispersed trajectories and describe the distribution of a launch vehicle's position and velocity as a function of winds and performance error parameters in the uprange, downrange, left-crossrange and right-crossrange directions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma maximum performance trajectory that provides the maximum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma minimum performance trajectory that provides the minimum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after lift-off by the three-sigma maximum and three-sigma minimum performance trajectories. The three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory, the analysis must use composite head wind and composite tail wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect upon instantaneous impact point range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma left lateral trajectory that provides the maximum left crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma right lateral trajectory that provides the maximum right crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after liftoff by the three-sigma left lateral and three-sigma right lateral performance trajectories. The three-sigma lateral performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In producing each left and right lateral trajectory, the analysis must use composite left and composite right lateral-wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect on the lateral deviation of the instantaneous impact point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fuel-exhaustion trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory for the launch of any launch vehicle with a final suborbital stage that will terminate thrust nominally without burning to fuel exhaustion. The analysis must produce the trajectory that would occur if the planned thrust termination of the final suborbital stage did not occur. The analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory that extends either the nominal trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage or the three-sigma maximum trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage, whichever produces an instantaneous impact point with the greatest range for any time after liftoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Straight-up trajectory. A trajectory analysis must produce a straight-up trajectory that begins at the planned time of ignition, and that simulates a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle to fly in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point. A straight-up trajectory must last no less than the sum of the straight-up time determined as required by section A417.15 plus the duration of a potential malfunction turn determined as required by section A417.9(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Analysis process and computations. A trajectory analysis must produce each three-sigma trajectory required by this appendix using a six-degree-of-freedom trajectory model and an analysis method, such as root sum-square or Monte Carlo, that accounts for all individual launch vehicle performance error parameters that contribute to the dispersion of the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A trajectory analysis must identify all launch vehicle performance error parameters and each parameter's distribution to account for all launch vehicle performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. A trajectory analysis must account for, but need not be limited to, the following performance error parameters:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Thrust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thrust misalignment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specific impulse;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Weight;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Variation in firing times of the stages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Fuel flow rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Contributions from the guidance, navigation, and control systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Steering misalignment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Winds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each three-sigma trajectory must account for the effects of wind from liftoff through the point in flight where the launch vehicle attains an altitude where wind no longer affects the launch vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Trajectory analysis products. The products of a trajectory analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assumptions and procedures. A description of all assumptions, procedures and models, including the six-degrees-of-freedom model, used in deriving each trajectory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Three-sigma launch vehicle performance error parameters. A description of each three-sigma performance error parameter accounted for by the trajectory analysis and a description of each parameter's distribution determined as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wind profile. A graph and tabular listing of each wind profile used in performing the trajectory analysis as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the worst case winds required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The graph and tabular wind data must provide wind magnitude and direction as a function of altitude for the air space regions from the Earth's surface to 100,000 feet in altitude for the area intersected by the launch vehicle trajectory. Altitude intervals must not exceed 5000 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Launch azimuth. The azimuthal direction of the trajectory's ''X-axis'' at liftoff measured clockwise in degrees from true north.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Launch point.

The name of the reference ellipsoid used by the trajectory analysis to approximate the average curvature of the Earth and the following information about the model:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Length of semi-major axis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Length of semi-minor axis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Flattening parameter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Eccentricity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Gravitational parameter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Angular velocity of the Earth at the equator; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If the reference ellipsoid is not a WGS-84 ellipsoidal Earth model, the equations that convert the filed ellipsoid information to the WGS-84 ellipsoid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Temporal trajectory items. A launch operator must provide the following temporal trajectory data for time intervals not in excess of one second and for the discrete time points that correspond to each jettison, ignition, burnout, and thrust termination of each stage. If any stage burn time lasts less

than four seconds, the time intervals must not exceed 0.2 seconds. The launch operator must provide the temporal trajectory data from launch up to a point in flight when effective thrust of the final stage terminates, or to thrust termination of the stage or burn that places the vehicle in orbit. For an unguided sub-orbital launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the launch operator must provide these data for each nominal quadrant launcher elevation angle and payload weight. The launch operator must provide these data on paper in text format and electronically in ASCII text, space delimited format. The launch operator must provide an electronic ``read-me'' file that identifies the data and their units of measure in the individual disk files.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Trajectory time-after-liftoff. A launch operator must provide trajectory time-after liftoff measured from first motion of the first thrusting stage of the launch vehicle. The tabulated data must identify the first motion time as T-0 and as the ``0.0'' time point on the trajectory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Launch vehicle direction cosines. A launch operator must provide the direction cosines of the roll axis, pitch axis, and yaw axis of the launch vehicle. The roll axis is a line identical to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis with its origin at the nominal center of gravity positive towards the vehicle nose. The roll plane is normal to the roll axis at the vehicle's nominal center of gravity. The yaw axis and the pitch axis are any two orthogonal axes lying in the roll plane. The launch operator must provide roll, pitch and yaw axes of right-handed systems so that, when looking along the roll axis toward the nose, a clockwise rotation around the roll axis will send the pitch axis toward the yaw axis. The right-handed system must be oriented so that the yaw axis is positive in the downrange direction while in the vertical position (roll axis upward from surface) or positive at an angle of 180 degrees to the downrange direction. The axis may be related to the vehicle's normal orientation with respect to the vehicle's trajectory but, once defined, remain fixed with respect to the vehicle's body. The launch operator must indicate the positive direction of the yaw axis chosen. The analysis products must present the direction cosines using the EFG reference system described in paragraph (g)(7)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> X, Y, Z, XD, YD, ZD trajectory coordinates. A launch operator must provide the launch vehicle position coordinates (X, Y, Z) and velocity magnitudes (XD, YD, ZD) referenced to an orthogonal, Earth-fixed, right-handed coordinate system. The XY plane must be tangent to the ellipsoidal Earth at the origin, which must coincide with the launch point. The positive X-axis must coincide with the launch azimuth. The positive Z-axis must be directed away from the ellipsoidal Earth. The Y-axis must be positive to the left looking downrange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> E, F, G, ED, FD, GD trajectory coordinates. A launch operator must provide the launch vehicle position coordinates (E, F, G) and velocity magnitudes (ED, FD, GD) referenced to an orthogonal, Earth fixed, Earth centered, right-handed coordinate system. The origin of the EFG system must be at the center of the reference ellipsoid. The E and F axes must lie in the plane of the equator and the G-axis coincides with the rotational axis of the Earth. The E-axis must be positive through 0[deg] East longitude (Greenwich Meridian), the F-axis positive through 90' East longitude, and the G-axis positive through the North Pole. This system must be non-inertial and rotate with the Earth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Resultant Earth-fixed velocity. A launch operator must provide the square root of the sum of the squares of the XD, YD, and ZD components of the trajectory state vector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Path angle of velocity vector. A launch operator must provide the angle between the local horizontal plane and the velocity vector measured positive upward from the local horizontal. The local horizontal must be a plane tangent to the ellipsoidal Earth at the sub-vehicle point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Sub-vehicle point. A launch operator must provide sub-vehicle point coordinates that include present position geodetic latitude and present position longitude. These coordinates must be at each trajectory time on the surface of the ellipsoidal Earth model and located at the intersection of the line normal to the ellipsoid and passing through the launch vehicle center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Altitude. A launch operator must provide the distance from the sub-vehicle point to the launch vehicle's center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Present position arc-range. A launch operator must provide the distance measured along the surface of the reference ellipsoid, from the launch point to the sub-vehicle point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Total weight. A launch operator must provide the sum of the inert and propellant weights for each time point on the trajectory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Total vacuum thrust. A launch operator must provide the total vacuum thrust for each time point on the trajectory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Instantaneous impact point data. A launch operator must provide instantaneous impact point geodetic latitude, instantaneous impact point longitude, instantaneous impact point arc-range, and time to instantaneous impact. The instantaneous impact point arc-range must consist of the distance, measured along the surface of the reference ellipsoid, from the launch point to the instantaneous impact point. For each point on the trajectory, the time to instantaneous impact must consist of the vacuum flight time remaining until impact if all thrust

were terminated at the time point on the trajectory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Normal trajectory distribution. A launch operator must provide a description of the distribution of the dispersed trajectories required under paragraph (d) of this section, such as the elements of covariance matrices for the launch vehicle position coordinates and velocity component magnitudes.</p><p class="depth0">A417.9 Malfunction turn</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A flight safety analysis must include a malfunction turn analysis that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 417.209. This section applies to the computation of the malfunction turns and the production of turn data required by Sec. 417.209 and to the malfunction turn analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by Sec. 417.203(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Malfunction turn analysis constraints. The following constraints apply to a malfunction turn analysis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The analysis must produce malfunction turns that start at a given malfunction start time. The turn must last no less than 12 seconds. These duration limits apply regardless of whether or not the vehicle would breakup or tumble before the prescribed duration of the turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A malfunction turn analysis must account for the thrusting periods of flight along a nominal trajectory beginning at first motion until thrust termination of the final thrusting stage or until the launch vehicle achieves orbit, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A malfunction turn must consist of a 90-degree turn or a turn in both the pitch and yaw planes that would produce the largest deviation from the nominal instantaneous impact point of which the launch vehicle is capable at any time during the malfunction turn as required by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The first malfunction turn must start at liftoff. The analysis must account for subsequent malfunction turns initiated at regular nominal trajectory time intervals not to exceed four seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A malfunction turn analysis must produce malfunction turn data for time intervals of no less than one second over the duration of each malfunction turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The analysis must assume that the launch vehicle performance is nominal up to the point of the malfunction that produces the turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A malfunction turn analysis must not account for the effects of gravity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A malfunction turn analysis must ensure the tumble turn envelope curve maintains a positive slope throughout the malfunction turn duration as illustrated in figure A417.9-1. When calculating a tumble turn for an aerodynamically unstable launch vehicle, in the high aerodynamic region it often turns out that no matter how small the initial deflection of the rocket engine, the airframe tumbles through 180 degrees, or one-half cycle, in less time than the required turn duration period. In such a case, the analysis must use a 90-degree turn as the malfunction turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failure modes. A malfunction turn analysis must account for the significant failure modes that result in a thrust vector offset from the nominal state. If a malfunction turn at a malfunction start time can occur as a function of more than one failure mode, the analysis must account for the failure mode that causes the most rapid and largest launch vehicle instantaneous impact point deviation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Type of malfunction turn. A malfunction turn analysis must establish the maximum turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector during each malfunction turn by accounting for a 90-degree turn to estimate the vehicle's turning capability or by accounting for trim turns and tumble turns in both the pitch and yaw planes to establish the vehicle's turning capability. When establishing the turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector, the analysis must account for each turn as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 90-degree turn. A 90-degree turn must constitute a turn produced at the malfunction start time by instantaneously re-directing and maintaining the vehicle's thrust at 90 degrees to the velocity vector, without regard for how this situation can be brought about.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pitch turn. A pitch turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the pitch-plane. The velocity vector's pitch-plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's yaw-axis and the launch vehicle's roll-axis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Yaw turn. A yaw turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the lateral plane. The velocity vector's lateral plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's pitch axis and the launch vehicle's total velocity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Trim turn. A trim turn must constitute a turn where a launch vehicle's thrust moment balances the aerodynamic moment while a constant rotation rate is imparted to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis. The analysis must account for a maximum-rate trim turn made at or near the greatest angle of attack that can be maintained while the aerodynamic moment is balanced by the thrust moment, whether the vehicle is stable or unstable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tumble turn. A tumble turn must constitute a turn that results if the launch vehicle's airframe rotates in an uncontrolled fashion, at an angular rate that is brought about by a thrust vector offset angle, and if the offset angle is held constant throughout

the turn. The analysis must account for a series of tumble turns, each turn with a different thrust vector offset angle, that are plotted on the same graph for each malfunction start time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Turn envelope. A turn envelope must constitute a curve on a tumble turn graph that has tangent points to each individual tumble turn curve computed for each malfunction start time. The curve must envelope the actual tumble turn curves to predict tumble turn angles for each area between the calculated turn curves. Figure A417.9-1 depicts a series of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn envelope curve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Malfunction turn capabilities. When not using a 90-degree turn, a malfunction turn analysis must establish the launch vehicle maximum turning capability as required by the following malfunction turn constraints:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Launch vehicle stable at all angles of attack. If a launch vehicle is so stable that the maximum thrust moment that the vehicle could experience cannot produce tumbling, but produces a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack less than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, by varying the initial thrust vector offset at the beginning of the turn. If the maximum thrust moment results in a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack greater than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns for angles of attack up to and including 90 degrees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Launch vehicle aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack. If flying a trim turn is not possible even for a period of only a few seconds, the malfunction turn analysis need only establish tumble turns. Otherwise, the malfunction turn analysis must establish a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, and the family of tumble turns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Launch vehicle unstable at low angles of attack but stable at some higher angles of attack. If large engine deflections result in tumbling, and small engine deflections do not, the analysis must produce a series of trim and tumble turns as required by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section for launch vehicles aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack. If both large and small constant engine deflections result in tumbling, regardless of how small the deflection might be, the analysis must account for the malfunction turn capabilities achieved at the stability angle of attack, assuming no upsetting thrust moment, and must account for the turns achieved by a tumbling vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Malfunction turn analysis products. The products of a malfunction turn analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A description of the assumptions, techniques, and equations used in deriving the malfunction turns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A set of sample calculations for at least one flight hazard area malfunction start time and one downrange malfunction start time. The sample computation for the downrange malfunction must start at a time at least 50 seconds after the flight hazard area malfunction start time or at the time of nominal thrust termination of the final stage minus the malfunction turn duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A launch operator must file malfunction turn data in electronic tabular and graphic formats. The graphs must use scale factors such that the plotting and reading accuracy do not degrade the accuracy of the data. For each malfunction turn start time, a graph must use the same time scales for the malfunction velocity vector turn angle and malfunction velocity magnitude plot pairs. A launch operator must provide tabular listings of the data used to generate the graphs in digital ASCII file format. A launch operator must file the data items required in this paragraph for each malfunction start time and for time intervals that do not exceed one second for the duration of each malfunction turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Velocity turn angle graphs. A launch operator must file a velocity turn angle graph for each malfunction start time. For each velocity turn angle graph, the ordinate axis must represent the total angle turned by the velocity vector, and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn and must show increments not to exceed one second. The series of tumble turns must include the envelope of all tumble turn curves. The tumble turn envelope must represent the tumble turn capability for all possible constant thrust vector offset angles. Each tumble turn curve selected to define the envelope must appear on the same graph as the envelope. A launch operator must file a series of trim turn curves for representative values of thrust vector offset. The series of trim turn curves must include the maximum rate trim turn. Figure A417.9-1 depicts an example family of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn velocity vector envelope.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25AU06.005</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Velocity magnitude graphs. A launch operator must file a velocity magnitude graph for each malfunction start time. For each malfunction velocity magnitude graph, the ordinate axis must represent the magnitude of the velocity vector and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn. Each graph must show the abscissa divided into increments not to exceed one second. Each graph must show the total velocity magnitude plotted as a function of time starting with the malfunction start time for each thrust vector offset used to define the corresponding velocity turn-angle curve. A launch operator must provide a corresponding velocity magnitude curve for each velocity tumble turn angle curve and each velocity trim-turn angle curve. For each individual tumble turn curve selected to define the tumble turn envelope, the corresponding velocity magnitude graph must show the individual tumble turn curve's point of tangency to the envelope. The point of tangency must consist of the point where the tumble turn envelope is tangent to an individual tumble turn curve produced with a discrete thrust vector offset angle. A launch operator must transpose the points of tangency to the velocity magnitude curves by plotting a point on the velocity magnitude curve at the same time point where tangency occurs on the corresponding velocity tumble-turn angle curve. Figure A417.9-2 depicts an example tumble turn velocity magnitude curve.

A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for flight and for launch processing must identify all toxic propellants used for each launch, including all toxic propellants on all launch vehicle components and payloads. Table I417-2 lists commonly used toxic propellants and the associated toxic concentration thresholds used by the Federal launch ranges for controlling potential public exposure. The toxic concentration thresholds contained in Table I417-2 are peak exposure concentrations in parts per million (ppm). A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to ensure that the public is not exposed to concentrations above the toxic concentration thresholds for each toxicant involved in a launch. A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds contained in table I417-2 for those propellants. Any propellant not identified in table I417-1 or table I417-2 falls into the category of unique or uncommon propellants, such as those identified in table I417-3, which are toxic or produce toxic combustion by-products. Table I417.3 is not an exhaustive list of possible toxic propellants and combustion by-products. For a launch that uses any propellant listed in table I417-3 or any other unique propellant not listed, a launch operator must identify the chemical composition of the propellant and all combustion by-products and the release scenarios.

For each launch, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine all hazards to the public from any toxic release that will occur during the proposed flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish for each launch, in accordance with Sec. 417.113(b), flight commit criteria that protect the public from a casualty arising out of any potential toxic release. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine if toxic release can occur based on an evaluation of the propellants, launch vehicle materials, and estimated combustion products. This evaluation must account for both normal combustion products and the chemical composition of any unreacted propellants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evaluating toxic hazards for launch vehicle flight. Each launch must satisfy either the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Toxic containment for launch vehicle flight. For a launch that uses any toxic propellant, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a hazard distance for each toxicant and a toxic hazard area for the launch. A hazard distance for a toxicant is the furthest distance from the launch point where toxic concentrations may be greater than the toxicant's toxic concentration threshold in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. A toxic hazard area defines the region on the Earth's surface that may be exposed to toxic concentrations

greater than any toxic concentration threshold of any toxicant involved in a launch in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine a toxic hazard area in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In order to achieve containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public from a toxic hazard area as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section or employ meteorological constraints as required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A launch operator must determine the hazard distance for a quantity of toxic propellant and determine and implement a toxic hazard area for a launch as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hazard distances for common propellants. Table I417-4 lists toxic hazard distances as a function of propellant quantity and toxic concentration threshold for commonly used propellants released from a catastrophic launch vehicle failure. Tables I417-10 and I417-11 list the hazard distance as a function of solid propellant mass for HC1 emissions during a launch vehicle failure and during normal flight for ammonium perchlorate based solid propellants. A launch operator must use the hazard distances corresponding to the toxic concentration thresholds established for a launch to determine the toxic hazard area for the launch in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hazard distances for uncommon or unique propellants. For a launch that involves any uncommon or unique propellant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each such propellant using an analysis methodology that accounts for the following worst case conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Surface wind speed of 2.9 knots with a wind speed increase of 1.0 knot per 1000 feet of altitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Surface temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit with a dry bulb temperature lapse rate of 13.7 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet over the first 500 feet of altitude and a lapse rate of 3.0 degrees F per 1000 feet above 500 feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Directional wind shear of 2 degrees per 1000 feet of altitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Relative humidity of 50 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Capping temperature inversion at the thermally stabilized exhaust cloud center of mass altitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Worst case initial source term assuming instantaneous release of fully loaded propellant storage tanks or pressurized motor segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Worst case combustion or mixing ratios such that production of toxic chemical species is maximized within the bounds of reasonable uncertainties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Evaluation of toxic hazards for both normal launch and vehicle abort failure modes.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25AU06.104</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Toxic hazard area. Having determined the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard area for a launch as a circle centered at the launch point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance determined as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, of all the toxicants involved in the launch. A launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(3) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The launch operator demonstrates that there are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The launch operator ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, flight and immediate postflight operations at the launch site. To ensure the absence of the public, a launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and related provisions for implementation as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed under Sec. Sec. 417.111(b) and 417.111(j), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area. For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area, the launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(5) of this section if the launch operator evacuates all people from all populated areas at risk and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling and flight. A launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and provisions for implementation of the evacuations as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan developed according to Sec. Sec. 417.111(b), 417.111(j) and 417.111(i), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Flight meteorological constraints. For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the launch is exempt from any further requirements of this section if the launch operator constrains the flight of a launch vehicle to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that any potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When employing wind constraints, a launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain any populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The launch operator must demonstrate that there are no populated areas within any arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, and immediate postflight operations at the launch site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that any winds present at the time of flight will transport any toxicant into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from any populated area. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for any uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds. When determining the wind uncertainty, a launch operator must account for the variance of the mean wind directions derived from measurements of the winds through the first 6000 feet in altitude at the launch point. Each clockwise and counterclockwise safety buffer must be no less than 20 degrees of arc width within the arc segment toxic hazard area. A launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of flight satisfy the wind constraints. To accomplish this, a launch operator must monitor the launch site vertical profile of winds from the altitude of the launch point to no less than 6,000 feet above ground level. The launch operator must proceed with a launch only if all wind vectors within this vertical range satisfy the wind constraints. A launch operator must develop wind constraint flight commit criteria and implementation provisions as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and its hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed according to Sec. Sec. 417.111(b) and 417.111(j), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at any potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of each toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that flight will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Statistical toxic risk management for flight. If a launch that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety. For each such case, a launch operator must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop launch commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements contained in Sec. 417.107(b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All credible vehicle failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of propellants and other vehicle combustible materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All vehicle failure rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of each released toxicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of each toxicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Meteorological conditions at the time of launch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for all populations within each potential toxic hazard area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for all populations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Flight toxic release hazard analysis products. The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight to be filed in accordance with Sec. 417.203(e) must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each launch, a listing of all propellants used on all launch vehicle components and any payloads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The chemical composition of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The quantities of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products involved in the launch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each toxic propellant and combustion product, identification of the toxic concentration threshold used in the toxic risk analysis and a description of how the toxic concentration threshold was determined if other than specified in table I417.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When using the toxic containment approach of paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The hazard distance for each toxic propellant and combustion product and a description of how it was determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A graphic depiction of the toxic hazard area or areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A listing of any wind or other constraints on flight, and any plans for evacuation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of how the launch operator determines real-time wind direction in relation to the launch site and any populated area and any other meteorological condition in order to implement constraints on flight or to implement evacuation plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When using the statistical toxic risk management approach of paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the launch operator's toxic risk management process, including an explanation of how the launch operator ensures that any toxic risk from launch meets the toxic risk criteria of Sec. 417.107(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A listing of all models used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A listing of all flight commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A description of how the launch operator measures and displays real-time meteorological conditions in order to determine whether conditions at the time of flight are within the envelope of those used by the launch operator for toxic risk assessment and to develop flight commit criteria, or for use in any real-time physics models used to ensure compliance with the toxic flight commit criteria.</p><p class="depth0">I417.7 Toxic release hazard analysis for launch processing</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to determine potential public hazards from toxic releases that will occur during normal launch processing and that will occur in the event of a mishap during launch processing. This section implements the ground safety requirements of Sec. 417.407(g). A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish hazard controls for protecting the public. A launch operator must include the toxic release hazard analysis results in the ground safety plan as required by Sec. 417.111(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Process hazards analysis. A launch operator must perform an analysis on all processes to identify toxic hazards and determine the potential for release of a toxic propellant. The analysis must account for the complexity of the process and must identify and evaluate the hazards and each hazard control involved in the process. An analysis that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) satisfies paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A launch operator's process hazards analysis must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify and evaluate each hazard of a process involving a toxic propellant using an analysis method, such as a failure mode and effects analysis or fault tree analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Describe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each toxic hazard associated with the process and the potential for release of toxic propellants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each mishap or incident experienced which has a potential for catastrophic consequences;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each engineering and administrative control applicable to each hazard and their interrelationships, such as application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases and evacuation of toxic hazard areas prior to conducting an operation that involves a toxicant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Location of the source of the release;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All human factors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Each opportunity for equipment malfunction or human error that can cause an accidental release;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Each safeguard used or needed to control each hazard or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Each step or procedure needed to detect or monitor releases; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The process hazards analysis must be updated for each launch. The launch operator must conduct a review of all the hazards associated with each process involving a toxic propellant for launch processing. The review must include inspection of equipment to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated, maintained, and operated according to the current process hazards analysis. A launch operator must revise a process hazards analysis to reflect changes in processes, types of toxic propellants stored or handled, or other aspects of a source of a potential toxic release that can affect the results of overall toxic release hazard analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The personnel who perform a process hazard analysis must possess expertise in engineering and process operations, and at least one person must have experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated. At least one person must be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A launch operator must resolve all recommendations resulting from a process hazards analysis in a timely manner prior to launch processing and the resolution must be documented. The documentation must identify each corrective action and include a written schedule of when any such actions are to be completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evaluating toxic hazards of launch processing. A launch operator must protect the public from each potential toxic hazard identified by the process hazards analysis required by paragraph (b) of this section, the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph

(d) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (l) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Toxic containment for launch processing. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a toxic hazard area surrounding the potential release site for each toxic propellant based on the amount and toxicity of the propellant and the meteorological conditions involved. A launch operator must determine whether there are populated areas located within a toxic hazard area that satisfy paragraph (h) of this section. If necessary to achieve toxic containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public in order to satisfy paragraph (i) of this section or employ meteorological constraints that satisfy paragraph (j) of this section. A launch operator, in determining a toxic hazard area, must first perform a worst-case release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (e) of this section or a worst-case alternative release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (f) of this section for each process that involves a toxic propellant. The launch operator must then determine a toxic hazard distance for each process that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Worst-case release scenario analysis. A launch operator's worst-case release scenario analysis must account for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of worst-case release quantity. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release quantity of a toxic propellant by selecting the greater of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For toxic propellants in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic liquid propellant as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A launch operator must assume that for toxic propellants that are normally liquids at ambient temperature, the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The launch operator must determine surface area of the pool by assuming that the liquid spreads to one centimeter deep unless passive mitigation systems are in place that serve to contain the spill and limit the surface area. Where passive mitigation is in place, the launch operator must use the surface area of the contained liquid to calculate the volatilization rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the release occurs on a surface that is not paved or smooth, the launch operator may account for actual surface characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The volatilization rate must account for the highest daily maximum temperature occurring in the past three years, the temperature of the substance in the vessel, and the concentration of the toxic propellants if the liquid spilled is a mixture or solution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The launch operator must determine rate of release to the air from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, available at http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/ap-ocgu.htm, or an air dispersion modeling technique that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Worst-case release scenario for toxic gases. A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic gas as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For toxic propellants that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel, or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The launch operator must assume a release rate that is the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, the launch operator must assume that the toxic propellant is released as a gas in 10 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool. The launch operator must calculate the volatilization rate at the boiling point of the toxic propellant and at the conditions defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Consideration of passive mitigation. The launch operator must account for passive mitigation systems in the analysis of a worst case release scenario if the passive mitigation system is capable of withstanding the release event triggering the scenario and would function as intended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional factors in selecting a worst-case scenario. A launch operator's worst-case release scenario for a toxic propellant must account for each factor that would result in a greater toxic hazard distance, such as a smaller quantity of the toxic propellant than

required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, that is handled at a higher process temperature or pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Worst-case alternative release scenario analysis. A launch operator's worst-case alternative release scenario analysis must account for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The worst-case release scenario for each toxic propellant and for each toxic propellant handling process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each release event that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario that is determined in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each release scenario that exceeds a toxic concentration threshold at a distance that reaches the general public;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each potential transfer hose release due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each potential process piping release from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, valve seals, and drain bleeds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each potential process vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each vessel overfilling and spill, or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Mishandling or dropping flight or ground hardware that contains toxic commodities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Each active and passive mitigation system provided they are capable of withstanding the event that triggered the release and would still be functional;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> History of each accident experienced by the launch operator involving the release of a toxic propellant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Each failure scenario.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Toxic hazard distances for launch processing. For each process involving a toxic propellant, a launch operator must perform an air dispersion analysis to determine the hazard distance for the worst-case release scenario or the worst-case alternative release scenario as determined under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, or an air dispersion modeling technique that is applicable to the proposed launch. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must account for the following analysis parameters:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Toxic concentration thresholds. A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds defined by section I417.3(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wind speed and atmospheric stability class. A launch operator, for the worst-case release analysis, must use a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and atmospheric stability class F. If the launch operator demonstrates that local meteorological data applicable to the source of a toxic release show a higher wind minimum wind speed or less stable atmosphere during the three previous years, the launch operator may use these minimums. The launch operator, for analysis of the worst-case alternative scenario, must use statistical meteorological conditions for the location of the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ambient temperature and humidity. For a worst-case release scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the launch operator must use the highest daily maximum temperature from the last three years and average humidity for the site, based on temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station. For analysis of a worst-case alternative release scenario, the launch operator must use typical temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Height of release. The launch operator must analyze the worst-case release of a toxic propellant assuming a ground level release. For a worst-case alternative scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the release scenario may determine release height.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Surface roughness. The launch operator must use either an urban or rural topography, as appropriate. Urban means that there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees. Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Dense or neutrally buoyant gases. Models or tables used for dispersion analysis of a toxic propellant must account for gas density.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Temperature of release substance. For a worst-case release scenario, the launch operator must account for the release of liquids other than gases liquefied by refrigeration at the highest daily maximum temperature, based on data for the previous three years appropriate to the source of the potential toxic release, or at process temperature, whichever is higher. For a worst-case alternative scenario, the launch operator may consider toxic propellants released at a process or ambient temperature that is appropriate for the scenario.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Toxic hazard areas for launch processing. A launch operator, having determined the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold for each toxic propellant involved in a process using either a worst-case release scenario or a worst-case alternative release scenario, must determine the toxic hazard area for the process as a circle centered at the potential release point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance for the toxic propellants involved in the process. A launch operator does not have to satisfy this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is no member of the public present within the toxic hazard area during the process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area. For a process where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area, the launch processing operation does not have to satisfy this section if the launch operator evacuates the public from the populated area and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during the operation. A launch operator must coordinate notification and evacuation procedures with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and ensure that notification and evacuation occurs according to its launch plans, including the launch operator's ground safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, accident investigation plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Meteorological constraints for launch processing. For a launch processing operation with the potential for a toxic release where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated as required by paragraph (i) of this section, the operation is exempt from further requirements in this section if the launch operator constrains the process to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that the potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints that satisfy the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A launch operator must limit a launch processing operation to times during which prevailing winds will transport a toxic release away from populated areas that would otherwise be at risk. If the mean wind speed during the operation is equal to or greater than four knots, the launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area as determined in paragraph (h) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain a populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings. If the mean wind speed during the operation is less than four knots, the toxic hazard area for the operation must be the full 360-degree toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The total arc width of an arc segment hazard area for launch processing must be greater than or equal to 30 degrees. If the launch operator determines the standard deviation of the measured wind direction, the total arc width of an arc segment hazard area must include all azimuths within the mean measured wind direction plus three sigma and the mean measured wind direction minus three sigma; otherwise, the following apply for the conditions defined by the Pasquil-Gifford meteorological stability classes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is less than 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 90 degrees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is greater than or equal to 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 45 degrees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For neutral class C, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 60 degrees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For slightly unstable class B, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 105 degrees; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For mostly unstable class A, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 150 degrees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The launch operator must ensure that there are no populated areas within an arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during the process as defined by paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that winds present at the time of an operation will transport toxicants into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from populated areas. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area as determined under paragraph (h) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at a potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of the toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that the operation will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the operation, or the operation will be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Implementation of meteorological constraints. A launch operator must use one or more of the following approaches to determine wind direction or other meteorological conditions in order to establish constraints on a launch processing operation or evacuate the populated area in a potential toxic hazard area:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of the process comply with the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area. The launch operator must monitor the vertical profile of winds at the potential toxic release site from ground level to an altitude of 10 meters or the maximum height above ground of the potential release, whichever is larger. The launch operator may proceed with a launch processing operation only if wind vectors meet the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A launch operator must monitor the specific meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations at a potential toxic release site for a process and for the sphere of influence out to each populated area within the potential toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The launch operator must monitor spatial variations in the wind field that could affect the transport of toxic material between the potential release site and populated areas. The launch operator must acquire real-time meteorological data from sites between the potential release site and each populated area sufficient to demonstrate that the toxic hazard area, when adjusted to the spatial wind field variations, excludes populated areas. Meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations from the potential release site and covering the sphere of influence out to the populated areas must fall within the conditions as determined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. A launch operator must use one of the following methods to determine the meteorological conditions that will constrain a launch processing operation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A launch operator may employ real-time air dispersion models to determine the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold and proximity of a toxicant to populated areas. A launch operator, when employing this method, must proceed with a launch processing operation only if real-time modeling of the potential release demonstrates that the toxic hazard distance would not reach populated areas. The launch operator's process for carrying out this method must include the use of an air dispersion modeling technique that complies with paragraph (g) of this section and providing real-time meteorological data for the sphere of influence around a potential toxic release site as input to the air dispersion model. The launch operator's process must also include a review of the meteorological conditions to identify changing conditions that could affect the toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold prior to proceeding with the operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A launch operator may use air dispersion modeling techniques to define the meteorological conditions that, when present, would prevent a toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold from reaching populated areas. The launch operator, when employing this method, must constrain the associated launch processing operation to be conducted only when the prescribed meteorological conditions exist. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must comply with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Statistical toxic risk management for launch processing. The launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety if a process that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A launch operator, for each such case, must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop criteria that protect the public from risks due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements defined in Sec. 417.107(b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All credible equipment failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of toxic propellants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Equipment failure rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of the released toxic propellants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of toxic propellants released;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Meteorological conditions at the time of the process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for populations within each potential toxic hazard area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for populations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Launch processing toxic release hazard analysis products. The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazards analysis for launch processing must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each worst-case release scenario, a description of the vessel or pipeline and toxic propellant selected as the worst case for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each worst-case alternative release scenario, a description of the scenario identified for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for the selection of that scenario.
