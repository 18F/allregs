                            <p class="depth0">The macadamia tree crop insurance provisions for the 2011 and  succeeding crop years are as follows:  FCIC Policies</p><p class="depth0">Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider).  Both FCIC and reinsured policies:</p><p class="depth0">Macadamia Tree Crop Provisions</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Age. The number of complete 12-month periods that have elapsed since  the month the trees were set out or were grafted, whichever is later.  Age determination will be made for each unit, or portion thereof, as of  January 1 of each crop year.</p><p class="depth0">Crop year. A period beginning with the date insurance attaches to  the macadamia tree crop extending through December 31 of the same  calendar year. The crop year is designated by the calendar year in which  insurance attaches.</p><p class="depth0">Destroyed. Trees damaged to the extent that we determine  replacement, including grafts, is required.</p><p class="depth0">Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in  the county for the crop to have normal growth and vigor, and are those  recognized by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture as  compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in the area.</p><p class="depth0">Graft. The uniting of a macadamia shoot to an established macadamia  tree rootstock for future production of macadamia nuts.</p><p class="depth0">Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any  form of alternating or mixed pattern.</p><p class="depth0">Irrigated practice. A method by which the normal growth and vigor of  the insured trees is maintained by artificially applying adequate  quantities of water during the growing season by appropriate systems and  at the proper times.</p><p class="depth0">Rootstock. The root and stem portion of a macadamia tree to which a  macadamia shoot can be grafted.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unit Division</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 34(b)(1), (3), and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by  section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated  and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Unless otherwise allowed  by written agreement, optional units may be established only if each  optional unit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contains at least 80 acres of insurable age macadamia trees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is located on non-contiguous land.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must have provided records, which can be independently  verified, of acreage and age of trees for each unit for at least the  last crop year.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Dollar Amounts for</p><p class="depth0">Determining Indemnities</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance  Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of  the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may select only one dollar amount of insurance for all the  macadamia trees in the county in each age group contained in the  actuarial table that are insured under this policy. The dollar amount of  insurance you choose for each age group must have the same percentage  relationship to the maximum dollar amount offered by us for each age  group. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum dollar  amount of insurance for one age group, you must also choose 100 percent  of the maximum dollar amount of insurance for all other age groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original  planting pattern, the dollar amount of insurance will be reduced 1  percent for each percent below 90 percent. For example, if the dollar  amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the stand is 85 percent  of the original stand, the dollar amount of insurance on which any  indemnity will be based is $1,900 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.95).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the  Special Provisions, by type if applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other  circumstance that may reduce the dollar amount of insurance and the  number of affected acres;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The month and year on which the trees were set out or grafted  and the planting pattern;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For the first year of insurance following replacement, the  month and year of replacement if more than 10 percent of the trees on  any unit have been replaced in the previous five crop years; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with  another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such  acreage is changed:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The planting pattern; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any other information that we request in order to establish your  dollar amount of insurance.</p><p class="depth5">We will reduce the dollar amount of insurance as necessary, based on  our estimate of the effect of interplanted perennial crop, removal of  trees, damage, change in practices, and any other circumstance that  adversely affects the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any  circumstance that may reduce your dollar amount of insurance from  previous levels, we will reduce your dollar amount of insurance as  necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The production reporting requirements contained in section 3  (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining  Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), do not apply to  macadamia trees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic  Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31  preceding the cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and  Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and  termination dates are December 31.</p><p class="depth0">6. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions  (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all macadamia trees in the  county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial table:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> That are grown for the production of macadamia nuts;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For which the rootstock is adapted to the area;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> That are at least one year of age when the insurance period  begins; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> That, if the orchard is inspected, is considered acceptable by  us.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the  Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a  crop planted with another crop, macadamia trees interplanted with  another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and  determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your  policy.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance  Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for  the year of application, if your application is received after December  22 but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after  your properly completed application is received in our local office,  unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine  that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any  information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition  of the orchard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each  crop year is December 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period)  of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after  coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop  year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable,  insurance   will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date  for the beginning of the insurance period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage  of macadamia trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop  year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no  premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year  unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar  form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such  transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</p><p class="depth0">9. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss)  of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only  against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance  period:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adverse weather conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been  controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Earthquake;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Volcanic eruption;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Wildlife, unless proper measures to control wildlife have not  been taken; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured  cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes  of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure  against damage due to disease or insect infestation, unless adverse  weather:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes  properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective  control mechanism is available.</p><p class="depth0">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event  of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), in case of  damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any  unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning or  removing any damaged trees.</p><p class="depth0">11. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by the dollar amount of  insurance per acre for each age group;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Totaling the results in section 11(b)(1);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiplying the total dollar amount of insurance obtained in  section 11(b)(2) by the applicable percent of loss, which is determined  as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subtract the coverage level percent you elected from 100  percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subtract the result obtained in section 11(b)(3)(i) from the  actual percent of loss;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Divide the result in section 11(b)(3)(ii) by the coverage  level you elected (For example, if you elected the 75 percent coverage  level and your actual percent of loss was 70 percent, the percent of  loss specified in section 11(b)(3) would be calculated as follows: 100%  - 75% = 25%; 70% - 25% = 45%; 45% / 75% = 60%.); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Multiply the result in section 11(b)(3) by your share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total amount of loss will include both trees damaged and  trees destroyed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any orchard with over 80 percent actual damage due to an insured  cause of loss will be considered to be 100 percent damaged; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any percent of damage by uninsured causes will not be included  in the percent of loss.</p><p class="depth3">12. Late and Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth3">The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.
