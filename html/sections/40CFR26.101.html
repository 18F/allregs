                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this policy  applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or  otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency  which takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy  applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal  civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or  agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be  appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research  conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal  Government outside the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research that is conducted or supported by a Federal department  or agency, whether or not it is regulated as defined in Sec. 26.102(e),  must comply with all sections of this policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Research that is neither conducted nor supported by a Federal  department or agency but is subject to regulation as defined in  Sec. 26.102(e) must be reviewed and approved, in compliance with  Sec. 26.101, Sec. 26.102, and Sec. 26.107 through Sec. 26.117 of this  policy, by an institutional review board (IRB) that operates in  accordance with the pertinent requirements of this policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise required by department or agency heads,  research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will  be in one or more of the following categories are exempt from this  policy:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Research conducted in established or commonly accepted  educational settings, involving normal educational practices, such as  (i) research on regular and special education instructional strategies,  or (ii) research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among  instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive,  diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview  procedures or observation of public behavior, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human  subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to  the subjects; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the  research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or  civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing,  employability, or reputation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive,  diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview  procedures, or observation of public behavior that is not exempt under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The human subjects are elected or appointed public officials or  candidates for public office; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Federal statute(s) require(s) without exception that the  confidentiality of the personally identifiable information will be  maintained throughout the research and thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Research, involving the collection or study of existing data,  documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if  these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded  by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified,  directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or  subject to the approval of department or agency heads, and which are  designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Public benefit or service programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those  programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or  procedures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits  or services under those programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance  studies,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If wholesome foods without additives are consumed or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or  below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical  or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by  the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental  Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a  particular activity is covered by this policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Department or agency heads may require that specific research  activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or  otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but not  otherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the  requirements of this policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent  Federal laws or regulations which provide additional protections for  human subjects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This policy does not affect any State or local laws or  regulations which may otherwise be applicable and which provide  additional protections for human subjects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations  which may otherwise be applicable and which provide additional  protections to human subjects of research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign  countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to  protect human subjects may differ from those set   forth in this policy. [An example is a foreign institution which  complies with guidelines consistent with the World Medical Assembly  Declaration (Declaration of Helsinki amended 1989) issued either by  sovereign states or by an organization whose function for the protection  of human research subjects is internationally recognized.] In these  circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the  procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at  least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or  agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in  lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when  otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or  agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in  the Federal Register or will be otherwise published as provided in  department or agency procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may  waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy  to specific research activities or classes of research activities  otherwise covered by this policy. Except when otherwise required by  statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward  advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research  Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any  successor office, and shall also publish them in the Federal Register or  in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Institutions with HHS-approved assurances on file will abide by  provisions of title 45 CFR part 46 subparts A-D. Some of the other  Departments and Agencies have incorporated all provisions of title 45  CFR part 46 into their policies and procedures as well. However, the  exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b) do not apply to research involving  prisoners, subpart C. The exemption at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), for research  involving survey or interview procedures or observation of public  behavior, does not apply to research with children, subpart D, except  for research involving observations of public behavior when the  investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed.
