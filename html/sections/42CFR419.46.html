For Hospital OQR Program purposes, hospitals that share the same CCN are required to complete a single online participation form. Once a hospital has submitted a participation form, it is considered to be an active Hospital OQR Program participant until such time as it submits a withdrawal form to CMS or no longer has an effective Medicare provider agreement. Deadlines for the participation form are described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, and are based on the date identified as a hospital's Medicare acceptance date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a hospital has a Medicare acceptance date before January 1 of the year prior to the affected annual payment update, the hospital must complete and submit to CMS a completed Hospital OQR Notice of Participation Form by July 31 of the calendar year prior to the affected annual payment update.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a hospital has a Medicare acceptance date on or after January 1 of the year prior to the affected annual payment update, the hospital must submit a completed participation form no later than 180 days from the date identified as its Medicare acceptance date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal from the Hospital OQR Program. A participating hospital may withdraw from the Hospital OQR Program by submitting to CMS a withdrawal form that can be found in the secure portion of the QualityNet Web site. The hospital may withdraw any time from January 1 to November 1 of the year prior to the affected annual payment updates. A withdrawn hospital will not be able to later sign up to participate in that payment update, is subject to a reduced annual payment update as specified under Sec. 419.43(h), and is required to submit a new participation form in order to participate in any future year of the Hospital OQR Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of Hospital OQR Program data. (1) General rule.

CMS may grant an extension or exception of one or more data submission deadlines and requirements in the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the hospital, such as when an act of nature affects an entire region or locale or a systemic problem with one of CMS' data collection systems directly or indirectly affects data submission. CMS may grant an extension or exception as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon request by the hospital.
