Under these procedures, funds may be swept or transferred from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to another type of deposit or nondeposit account. Unless the funds are in a noninterest-bearing transaction account after the completion of a sweep under Sec. 360.8, the funds will not

be guaranteed under the transaction account guarantee program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of funds swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings deposit account, the FDIC will treat the swept funds as being in a noninterest-bearing transaction account. As a result of this treatment, the funds swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings account, as defined in 12 CFR 204.2(d), will be guaranteed under the transaction account guarantee program.
