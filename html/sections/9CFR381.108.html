At any official establishment each such certificate shall be signed by the inspector who made the inspection covered by the certificate, and if more than one inspector participated in the inspection of the lot of poultry, each such inspector shall sign the certificate with respect to such lot. If the inspection of a lot covered by a certificate

Any inspector is authorized to issue a poultry inspection certificate with respect to any other poultry product inspected by him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The original and one copy of each poultry inspection certificate shall be issued to the applicant who requested such certificate, and one copy shall be retained by the inspector for filing. The inspector who issues any inspection certificate is authorized to furnish an additional copy of such certificate upon the request of an interested party. The person who sold the live poultry involved to the official establishment is an interested party for purposes of this section.
