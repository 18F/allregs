If the direct testimony of an expert witness is expected to be lengthy or of a complex, technical nature, the presiding officer may order that such direct testimony be submitted to the Commission in sworn, written form. Copies of said testimony shall be served upon all parties appearing at the hearing at least 10 days prior to said hearing. Such written testimony, however, shall not be admitted whenever the witness is not present and available for cross-examination at the hearing unless all parties have waived the right of cross-examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assessment of costs. (1) Whenever a hearing is conducted, the costs thereof, as herein defined, shall be assessed by the presiding officer to the petitioner or such other party as the hearing officer deems equitable.

The Commission may grant or refuse the request based upon

the contents of the affidavit or other factors, such as whether it believes the appeal or intervention is taken in good faith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Findings and report. The hearing officer shall prepare a report of his/her findings and recommendations based on the record of the hearing.
