if it appears to the regional director that there is reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exists, that the policies of the Act will be effectuated, and that an election will reflect the free choice of employees in an appropriate unit, the regional director shall prepare and cause to be served upon the parties and upon any known individuals or labor organizations purporting to act as representatives of any employees directly affected by such investigation, a notice of hearing before a hearing officer at a time and place fixed therein. Except in cases presenting unusually complex issues, the regional director shall set the hearing for a date 8 days from the date of service of the notice excluding intervening Federal holidays, but if the 8th day is a weekend or Federal holiday, the regional director shall set the hearing for the following business day. The regional director may postpone the hearing for up to 2 business days upon request of a party showing special circumstances. The regional director may postpone the opening of the hearing for more than 2 business days upon request of a party showing extraordinary circumstances. A copy of the petition, a description of procedures in representation cases, a ``Notice of Petition for Election'', and a Statement of Position form as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, shall be served with such notice of hearing.
