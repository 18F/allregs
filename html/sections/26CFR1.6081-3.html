                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation or an affiliated group of corporations  filing a consolidated return will be allowed an automatic 6-month  extension of time to file its income tax return after the date  prescribed for filing the return if the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application must be submitted on Form 7004, ``Application for  Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax,  Information, and Other Returns,'' or in any other manner prescribed by  the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application must be filed on or before the date prescribed  for the filing of the return of the corporation (or the consolidated  return of the affiliated group of corporations) with the Internal  Revenue Service office designated in the application's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The corporation (or affiliated group of corporations filing a  consolidated return) must remit the amount of the properly estimated  unpaid tax liability on or before the date prescribed for payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The application must include a statement listing the name and  address of each member of the affiliated group if the affiliated group  will file a consolidated return. Upon the timely filing of Form 7004,  the 6-month extension of time to file shall be considered as granted to  the affiliated group for the filing of its consolidated return or for  the filing of each member's separate return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No extension of time for the payment of tax.

The Commissioner may  terminate an automatic extension at any time by mailing a notice of  termination to the corporation (parent corporation in the case of an  affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return). The  notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to the termination date  designated in such notice. The notice of termination shall be sufficient  for all purposes when mailed to the corporation at the address shown on  Form 7004 or to the corporation's last known address. For further  guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec.  301.6212-2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No extension for DISCs.
