Sec. 257.90 through 257.98.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial timeframes--(1) Existing CCR landfills and existing CCR surface impoundments. No later than October 17, 2017, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must be in compliance with the following groundwater monitoring requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing CCR landfills and existing CCR surface impoundments. No later than October 17, 2017, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must be in compliance with the following groundwater monitoring requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install the groundwater monitoring system as required by Sec. 257.91;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Develop the groundwater sampling and analysis program to include selection of the statistical procedures to be used for evaluating groundwater monitoring data as required by Sec. 257.93;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Initiate the detection monitoring program to include obtaining a minimum of eight independent samples for each background and downgradient well as required by Sec. 257.94(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Begin evaluating the groundwater monitoring data for statistically significant increases over background

levels for the constituents listed in appendix III of this part as required by Sec. 257.94.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New CCR landfills, new CCR surface impoundments, and all lateral expansions of CCR units. Prior to initial receipt of CCR by the CCR unit, the owner or operator must be in compliance with the groundwater monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator of the CCR unit must initiate the detection monitoring program to include obtaining a minimum of eight independent samples for each background well as required by Sec. 257.94(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once a groundwater monitoring system and groundwater monitoring program has been established at the CCR unit as required by this subpart, the owner or operator must conduct groundwater monitoring and, if necessary, corrective action throughout the active life and post-closure care period of the CCR unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event of a release from a CCR unit, the owner or operator must immediately take all necessary measures to control the source(s) of releases so as to reduce or eliminate, to the maximum extent feasible, further releases of contaminants into the environment.

Sec. 257.96, 257.97, and 257.98.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. For existing CCR landfills and existing CCR surface impoundments, no later than January 31, 2018, and annually thereafter, the owner or operator must prepare an annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. For new CCR landfills, new CCR surface impoundments, and all lateral expansions of CCR units, the owner or operator must prepare the initial annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report no later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year a groundwater monitoring system has been established for such CCR unit as required by this subpart, and annually thereafter. For the preceding calendar year, the annual report must document the status of the groundwater monitoring and corrective action program for the CCR unit, summarize key actions completed, describe any problems encountered, discuss actions to resolve the problems, and project key activities for the upcoming year. For purposes of this section, the owner or operator has prepared the annual report when the report is placed in the facility's operating record as required by Sec. 257.105(h)(1). At a minimum, the annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report must contain the following information, to the extent available:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A map, aerial image, or diagram showing the CCR unit and all background (or upgradient) and downgradient monitoring wells, to include the well identification numbers, that are part of the groundwater monitoring program for the CCR unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of any monitoring wells that were installed or decommissioned during the preceding year, along with a narrative description of why those actions were taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to all the monitoring data obtained under Sec. Sec. 257.90 through 257.98, a summary including the number of groundwater samples that were collected for analysis for each background and downgradient well, the dates the samples were collected, and whether the sample was required by the detection monitoring or assessment monitoring programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A narrative discussion of any transition between monitoring programs (e.g., the date and circumstances for transitioning from detection monitoring to assessment monitoring in addition to identifying the constituent(s) detected at a statistically significant increase over background levels); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other information required to be included in the annual report as specified in Sec. Sec. 257.90 through 257.98.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. 257.105(h), the notification requirements specified in Sec. 257.106(h), and the internet requirements specified in Sec. 257.107(h).</p>
