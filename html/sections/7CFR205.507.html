                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Program Manager has reason to believe, based on a review  of the information specified in Secs. 205.503 through 205.505 or after a  site evaluation as specified in Sec. 205.508, that an applicant for  accreditation is not able to comply or is not in compliance with the  requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part, the Program  Manager shall provide a written notification of noncompliance to the  applicant. Such notification shall provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of each noncompliance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facts upon which the notification of noncompliance is based;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date by which the applicant must rebut or correct each  noncompliance and submit supporting documentation of each such  correction when correction is possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When each noncompliance has been resolved, the Program Manager  will send the applicant a written notification of noncompliance  resolution and proceed with further processing of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an applicant fails to correct the noncompliances, fails to  report the corrections by the date specified in the notification of  noncompliance, fails to file a rebuttal of the notification of  noncompliance by the date specified, or is unsuccessful in its rebuttal,  the Program Manager will provide the applicant with written notification  of accreditation denial. An applicant who has received written  notification of accreditation denial may apply for accreditation again  at any time in accordance with Sec. 205.502, or appeal the denial of  accreditation in accordance with Sec. 205.681 by the date specified in  the notification of accreditation denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the certifying agent was accredited prior to the site  evaluation and the certifying agent fails to correct the noncompliances,  fails to report the corrections by the date specified in the  notification of noncompliance, or fails to file a rebuttal of the  notification of noncompliance by the date specified, the Administrator  will begin proceedings to suspend or revoke the certifying agent's  accreditation. A certifying agent who has had its accreditation  suspended may at any time, unless otherwise stated in the notification  of suspension, submit a request to the Secretary for reinstatement of  its accreditation. The request must be accompanied by evidence  demonstrating correction of each noncompliance and corrective actions  taken to comply with and remain in compliance with the Act and the  regulations in this part. A certifying agent whose accreditation is  revoked will be ineligible for accreditation for a period of not less  than 3 years following the date of such determination.</p>
