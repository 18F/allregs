                            <p class="depth0">States have the opportunity to adjust errors in the payment of  contributions. A State but not its political subdivisions is authorized  to adjust errors in the underpayment of contributions. Similarly, the  State shall file all claims for credits or refunds and SSA makes the  credits and refunds only to the State. Generally, we do not refund  contributions in cash to a State unless the State is not expected to  have future liability for contributions under section 218 of the Act.</p>
