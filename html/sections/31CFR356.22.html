                                Sec. 356.22  Does the Treasury have any limitations on auction awards?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Awards to noncompetitive bidders. The maximum award to any  noncompetitive bidder is $5 million. This limit does not apply to  bidders bidding solely through TreasuryDirect [supreg] or Legacy  Treasury Direct [supreg] reinvestment requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Awards to competitive bidders. The maximum award is 35 percent  of the offering amount less the bidder's net long position as reportable  under Sec. 356.13. For example, in a note auction with a $10 billion  offering amount, and therefore a maximum award of $3.5 billion, a bidder  with a reported net long position of $1 billion could receive a maximum  auction award of $2.5 billion. When the bids and net long positions of  more than one person or entity must be combined, as is the case with  investment advisers and controlled accounts (See Sec. 356.15(c).), we  will use this combined amount for the purpose of this 35 percent award  limit.
