See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the Suspension and Debarment Official for consideration of debarment action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports. Include in referrals to the Suspension and Debarment Official a report that contains at least the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recommendation and supporting rationale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment, including the contractor, principals, and affiliates.

If information is withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May request the opportunity to present information and argument in person to the Suspension and Debarment Official. The Suspension and Debarment Official will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of

The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information and arguments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> May identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following a review of the record and, if needed, a presentation by the contractor in opposition to the proposed action, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. If so, the Suspension and Debarment Official will initiate the fact-finding process. The fact-finding official will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish a date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 days of the determination of who will function as the fact-finding official.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Grant extensions for good cause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide notice of the scheduled hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide the parties with a schedule for exchange of documents and witness lists.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Develop an official transcript of the fact-finding proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provide the Government's representative and the contractor with an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue.

Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finding official.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Provide for witness testimony. Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses are subject to cross examination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Prepare written findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence and submit them to both the Suspension and Debarment Official and the contractor within 20 calendar days following the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding.
