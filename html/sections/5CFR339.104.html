An acceptable diagnosis must include the following information, or parts identified by the agency as necessary and relevant:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The history of the medical conditions, including references to findings from previous examinations, treatment, and responses to treatment;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Clinical findings from the most recent medical evaluation, including any of the following which have been obtained: Findings of physical examination; results of laboratory tests; X-rays; EKG's and other special evaluations or diagnostic procedures; and, in the case of psychiatric evaluation of psychological assessment, the findings of a mental status examination and the results of psychological tests, if appropriate;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diagnosis, including the current clinical status;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prognosis, including plans for future treatment and an estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An explanation of the impact of the medical condition on overall health and activities, including the basis for any conclusion that restrictions or accommodations are or are not warranted, and where they are warranted, an explanation of their therapeutic of risk avoiding value;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion which indicates the likelihood that the individual is or is not expected to suffer sudden or subtle incapacitation by carrying out, with or without accommodation, the tasks or duties of a specific position;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Narrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that the medical condition has or has not become static or well stabilized and the likelihood that the individual may experience sudden or subtle incapacitation as a result of the medical condition.
