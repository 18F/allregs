                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each fishing year, the Regional Administrator shall  determine the initial allocation of surfclams and ocean quahogs for the  next fishing year for each allocation holder owning an allocation  pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For each species, the  initial allocation for the next fishing year is calculated by  multiplying the allocation percentage owned by each allocation owner as  of the last   day of the previous fishing year in which allocation owners are  permitted to permanently transfer allocation percentage pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section (i.e., October 15 of every year), by the  quota specified by the Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 648.72.  The total number of bushels of allocation shall be divided by 32 to  determine the appropriate number of cage tags to be issued or acquired  under Sec. 648.77. Amounts of allocation of 0.5 cages or smaller created  by this division shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole number,  and amounts of allocation greater than 0.5 cages created by this  division shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number, so that  allocations are specified in whole cages. These allocations shall be  made in the form of an allocation permit specifying the allocation  percentage and the allocation in cages and cage tags for each species.  An allocation permit is only valid for the entity for which it is  issued. Such permits shall be issued on or before December 15, to allow  allocation owners to purchase cage tags from a vendor specified by the  Regional Administrator pursuant to Sec. 648.77(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator may, after publication of a fee  notification in the Federal Register, charge a permit fee before  issuance of the permit to recover administrative expenses. Failure to  pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allocation percentage. Subject to the approval of  the Regional Administrator, part or all of an allocation percentage may  be transferred in the year in which the transfer is made, to any person  or entity eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46  U.S.C. 12102(a). Approval of a transfer by the Regional Administrator  and for a new allocation permit reflecting that transfer may be  requested by submitting a written application for approval of the  transfer and for issuance of a new allocation permit to the Regional  Administrator at least 10 days before the date on which the applicant  desires the transfer to be effective, in the form of a completed  transfer log supplied by the Regional Administrator. The transfer is not  effective until the new holder receives a new or revised annual  allocation permit from the Regional Administrator. An application for  transfer may not be made between October 15 and December 31 of each  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cage tags. Cage tags issued pursuant to Sec. 648.77 may be  transferred at any time, and in any amount subject to the restrictions  and procedure specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; provided  that application for such cage tag transfers may be made at any time  before December 10 of each year. The transfer is effective upon the  receipt by the transferee of written authorization from the Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. If the Regional Administrator determines that the  applicant has been issued a Notice of Permit Sanction for a violation of  the Magnuson-Stevens Act that has not been resolved, he/she may decline  to approve such transfer pending resolution of the matter.
