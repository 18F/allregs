                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds. During the term of the lease, the owner may not  terminate the tenancy except on the following grounds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Serious violation (including but not limited to failure to pay  rent or other amounts due under the lease) or repeated violation of the  terms and conditions of the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Violation of federal, State, or local law that imposes  obligations on the tenant in connection with the occupancy or use of the  premises; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonpayment by PHA: Not grounds for termination of tenancy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to  owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract  between the owner and the PHA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PHA failure to pay the housing assistance payment to the  owner is not a violation of the lease between the tenant and the owner.  During the term   of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for  nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Criminal activity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evicting drug criminals due to drug crime  on or near the premises. The lease must provide that drug-related  criminal activity engaged in, on or near the premises by any tenant,  household member, or guest, or such activity engaged in on the premises  by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the owner  to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that the owner  may evict a family when the owner determines that a household member is  illegally using a drug or when the owner determines that a pattern of  illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to  peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evicting other criminals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Threat to other residents. The  lease must provide that the owner may terminate tenancy for any of the  following types of criminal activity by a covered person:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or  right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents  (including property management staff residing on the premises);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or  right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in  the immediate vicinity of the premises; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any violent criminal activity on or near the premises by a  tenant, household member, or guest, or any such activity on the premises  by any other person under the tenant's control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fugitive felon or parole violator. The lease must provide that  the owner may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after  conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony  under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in  the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under  Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of criminal activity. The owner may terminate tenancy  and evict by judicial action a family for criminal activity by a covered  person in accordance with this section if the owner determines that the  covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of  whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such  activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a  criminal conviction. (See part 5, subpart J, of this title for  provisions concerning access to criminal records.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other good cause. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Other good cause'' for termination of  tenancy by the owner may include, but is not limited to, any of the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or  revision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A family history of disturbance of neighbors or destruction of  property, or of living or housekeeping habits resulting in damage to the  unit or premises;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use,  or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy  (such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to  lease the unit at a higher rental).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the initial lease term, the owner may not terminate the  tenancy for ``other good cause'', unless the owner is terminating the  tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do. For  example, during this period, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for  ``other good cause'' based on any of the following grounds: failure by  the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision; the owner's  desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose  other than as a residential rental unit; or a business or economic  reason for termination of the tenancy (see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owner notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of grounds. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner must give the  tenant a written notice that specifies the grounds for termination of  tenancy   during the term of the lease. The tenancy does not terminate before the  owner has given this notice, and the notice must be given at or before  commencement of the eviction action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice of grounds may be included in, or may be combined  with, any owner eviction notice to the tenant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eviction notice. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Owner eviction notice means a notice to  vacate, or a complaint or other initial pleading used under State or  local law to commence an eviction action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner must give the PHA a copy of any owner eviction notice  to the tenant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Eviction by court action. The owner may only evict the tenant  from the unit by instituting a court action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Regulations not applicable. 24 CFR part 247 (concerning  evictions from certain subsidized and HUD-owned projects) does not apply  to a tenancy assisted under this part 982.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Termination of tenancy decisions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If the law and  regulation permit the owner to take an action but do not require action  to be taken, the owner may take or not take the action in accordance  with the owner's standards for eviction. The owner may consider all of  the circumstances relevant to a particular eviction case, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The seriousness of the offending action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effect on the community of denial or termination or the  failure of the owner to take such action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent of participation by the leaseholder in the  offending action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The effect of denial of admission or termination of tenancy on  household members not involved in the offending activity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to  lease responsibilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal  responsibility and taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the  offending action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The effect of the owner's action on the integrity of the  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exclusion of culpable household member. The owner may require a  tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in  the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or  been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consideration of rehabilitation. In determining whether to  terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a  household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the owner  may consider whether such household member is participating in or has  successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation  program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C.  13661). For this purpose, the owner may require the tenant to submit  evidence of the household member's current participation in, or  successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation  program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nondiscrimination limitation and protection for victims of  domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking. The owner's termination  of tenancy actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal  opportunity provisions of 24 CFR 5.105, and with the provisions for  protection of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking  in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2577-0169)  [60 FR 34695, July 3, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 45661, Sept. 1, 1995; 64  FR 26645, May 14, 1999; 64 FR 56913, Oct. 21, 1999; 66 FR 28804, May 24,  2001; 73 FR 72344, Nov. 28, 2008; 75 FR 66263, Oct. 27, 2010]</p>
