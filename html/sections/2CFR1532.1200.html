As a  practical matter, you may learn about your disqualification from your  defense counsel, a Federal contract or award official, or from someone  else who sees your name in the EPLS. As a courtesy, the EPA will attempt  to notify you and the owner, lessor or supervisor of the violating  facility that your names have been entered into the EPLS. The EPA will  inform you of the procedures for seeking reinstatement and give you the  name of a person you can contact to discuss your reinstatement request.</p>
