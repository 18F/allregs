                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an agency has a significant number of requests, the nature of which precludes a determination within 20 working days, the requests may be processed in a multitrack processing system, based on the date of receipt, the amount of work and time involved in processing the request, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies may establish as many processing tracks as appropriate; processing within each track shall be based on a first-in, first-out concept, and rank-ordered by the date of receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agencies may provide a requester whose request does not qualify for the fastest track an opportunity to limit

the scope of the request in order to qualify for a faster track. This multitrack processing system does not lessen agency responsibility to exercise due diligence in processing requests in the most expeditious manner possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agencies shall process requests in each track on a ``first-in, first-out'' basis, unless there are unusual circumstances as set forth in Sec.  1.16, or the requester is entitled to expedited processing as set forth in Sec.  1.9.
