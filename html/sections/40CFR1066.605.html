Note that your Vmix  determination may vary from Eq. 1066.605-6 based on the number of flows  that are removed from your dilute exhaust gas and whether your PM  sampling system is using secondary dilution. For this example,  Vmix is governed by the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.096     Where:  VCVSstd = total dilute exhaust volume over the test interval</p><p class="depth3">at the flow meter, corrected to standard reference conditions.

The calculation methods  depend on differentiating varying and constant flow, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We consider the following to be examples of varying flows that  require a continuous multiplication of concentration times flow rate:  raw exhaust, exhaust diluted with a constant flow rate of dilution air,  and CVS dilution with a CVS flow meter that does not have an upstream  heat exchanger or electronic flow control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We consider the following to be examples of constant exhaust  flows: CVS diluted exhaust with a CVS flow meter that has an upstream  heat exchanger, an electronic flow control, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuous sampling.

If you batch sample from a constant exhaust  flow rate, extract a sample at a proportional or constant flow rate and  calculate V[flow] from the flow from which you extract the  sample by multiplying the mean flow rate by the time of the test  interval using the following equation:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.145   [79 FR 23823, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9121, Feb. 19, 2015]</p>
