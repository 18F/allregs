This process was completed for purposes  of the first repository before the enactment of the Act, and the  identification of such sites was made after enactment in accordance with  the provisions of section 116(a) of the Act. The screening process for  the identification of potentially acceptable sites for the second and  subsequent repositories shall be conducted in accordance with the  requirements specified in Sec. 960.3-2-1 of this subpart. The nomination  of any site as suitable for characterization shall follow the process  specified in Sec. 960.3-2-2, and such nomination shall be accompanied by  an environmental assessment as specified in section 112(b)(1)(E) of the  Act. The recommendation of sites as candidate sites for characterization  shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements specified in  Sec. 960.3-2-3.
