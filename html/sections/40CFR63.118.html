For flares, the hourly records and records of pilot flame outages specified in table 3 of this subpart shall be maintained in place of continuous records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records of the daily average value of each continuously monitored parameter for each operating day determined according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.152(f).
