                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General prohibition. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section, employees who personally and substantially  participate in or have official responsibility for the acquisition or  disposal of real estate or interests therein, shall not directly or  indirectly purchase or participate as an agent or otherwise in the  purchase of any real estate or interest therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does  not apply to an employee's purchase of real estate for use as his  personal or other residential property, such as a vacation home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver. An employee may make a purchase otherwise prohibited by  this section where a written waiver of the prohibition has been given to  the employee by the employee's immediate supervisor, with the advice of  a Deputy Standards of Conduct Counsellor or the Designated Agency Ethics  Official. Such a waiver may be granted only if a determination is made  that the waiver is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation, and  that in the mind of a reasonable person with knowledge of the particular  circumstances, the purchase of such real estate or interest therein will  not raise a question as to whether the employee will use his official  position or nonpublic information to obtain an advantageous purchase or  create an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of the  employee's duties.</p>
