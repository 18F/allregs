This section also contains a  compliance schedule provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coastal Recreation Waters are the Great Lakes  and marine coastal waters (including coastal estuaries) that are  designated under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act for use for  swimming, bathing, surfing, or similar water contact activities. Coastal  recreation waters do not include inland waters or waters upstream from  the mouth of a river or stream having an unimpaired natural connection  with the open sea.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Designated bathing beach waters are those coastal recreation  waters that, during the recreation season, are heavily-used (based upon  an evaluation of use within the State) and may have: a lifeguard,  bathhouse facilities, or public parking for beach access. States may  include any other waters in this category even if the waters do not meet  these criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Moderate use coastal recreation waters are those coastal  recreation waters that are not designated bathing beach waters but  typically, during the recreation season, are used by at least half of  the number of people as at typical designated bathing beach waters  within the State. States may also include light use or infrequent use  coastal recreation waters in this category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Light use coastal recreation waters are those coastal recreation  waters that are not designated bathing beach waters but typically,  during the recreation season, are used by less than half of the number  of people as at typical designated bathing beach waters within the  State, but are more than infrequently used. States may also include  infrequent use coastal recreation waters in this category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Infrequent use coastal recreation waters are those coastal  recreation waters that are rarely or occasionally used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> New pathogen discharger for the purposes of this section means  any building, structure, facility, or installation from which there is  or may be a discharge of pathogens, the construction of which commenced  on or after December 16, 2004. It does not include relocation of  existing combined sewer overflow outfalls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Existing pathogen discharger for the purposes of this section  means any discharger that is not a new pathogen discharger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> EPA's section 304(a) ambient water quality criteria for  bacteria.

(1) The criteria in  paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section apply to fresh coastal recreation  waters of the following States: Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section apply to marine  coastal recreation waters of the following States: Alaska, California  (except for coastal recreation waters within the jurisdiction of  Regional Board 4), Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (except for coastal  recreation waters within 300 meters of the shoreline), Louisiana, Maine  (except for SA waters and SB and SC waters with human sources of fecal  contamination), Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, North  Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico (except for waters classified by Puerto  Rico as intensely used for primary contact recreation and for those  waters included in Sec. 131.40), Rhode Island, United States Virgin  Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Schedules of compliance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (f) applies to any  State that does not have a regulation in effect for Clean Water Act  purposes that authorizes compliance schedules for National Pollutant  Discharge Elimination System permit limitations needed to meet the  criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. All dischargers shall  promptly comply with any new or more restrictive water quality-based  effluent limitations based on the water quality criteria set forth in  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a permit issued on or after December 16, 2004, to a new  pathogen discharger as defined in paragraph (b) of this section contains  water quality-based effluent limitations based on water quality criteria  set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the permittee shall comply  with such water quality-based effluent limitations upon the commencement  of the discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where an existing pathogen discharger reasonably believes that  it will be infeasible to comply immediately with a new or more  restrictive water quality-based effluent limitations based on the water  quality criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the  discharger may request approval from the permit issuing authority for a  schedule of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A compliance schedule for an existing pathogen discharger shall  require compliance with water quality-based effluent limitations based  on water quality criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section as  soon as possible, taking into account the discharger's ability to  achieve compliance with such water quality-based effluent limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the schedule of compliance for an existing pathogen  discharger exceeds one year from the date of permit issuance, reissuance  or modification, the schedule shall set forth interim requirements and  dates for their achievement. The period between dates of completion for  each requirement may not exceed one year.</p><p class="depth0">If the time necessary for completion of any requirement is more than  one year and the requirement is not readily divisible into stages for  completion, the permit shall require, at a minimum, specified dates for  annual submission of progress reports on the status of interim  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In no event shall the permit issuing authority approve a  schedule of compliance for an existing pathogen discharge which exceeds  five years from the date of permit issuance, reissuance, or  modification, whichever is sooner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If a schedule of compliance exceeds the term of a permit,  interim permit limits effective during the permit shall be included in  the permit and addressed in the permit's fact sheet or statement of  basis. The administrative record for the permit shall reflect final  permit limits and final compliance dates. Final compliance dates for  final permit limits, which do not occur during the term of the permit,  must occur within five years from the date of issuance, reissuance or  modification of the permit which initiates the compliance schedule.
