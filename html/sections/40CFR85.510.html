Your exemption from tampering is valid only if the conversion is  installed on the OEM test groups/engine families and/or evaporative  emissions/refueling families listed on the certificate. For example, if  you have received a clean alternative fuel conversion certificate of  conformity in conversion model year 2011 for converting a 2010 model  year OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family, your exemption from  tampering continues to apply for the conversion of the same 2010 model  year OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family as long as the  conditions under which the certificate was issued remain unchanged, such  as small volume manufacturer status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Conversion systems must be properly installed and adjusted such  that the vehicle/engine operates consistent with the principles of good  engineering judgment and in accordance with all applicable regulations.
