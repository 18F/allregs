                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of load forecasts prepared under an approved load  forecast work plan. In addition to the minimum requirements for load  forecasts under Sec. 1710.205, load forecasts developed and submitted by  borrowers required to have an approved load forecast work plan shall  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scope of the load forecast. The narrative shall address the  overall approach, time periods, and expected internal and external uses  of the forecast. Examples of internal uses include providing information  for developing or monitoring demand side management programs, supply  resource planning, load flow studies, wholesale power marketing, retail  marketing, cost of service studies, rate policy and development,  financial planning, and evaluating the potential effects on electric  revenues caused by competition from alternative energy sources or other  electric suppliers. Examples of external uses include meeting state and  Federal regulatory requirements, obtaining financial ratings, and  participation in reliability council, power pool, regional transmission  group, power supplier or member system forecasting and planning  activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resources used to develop the load forecast. The discussion  shall identify and discuss the borrower personnel, consultants, data  processing, methods and other resources used in the preparation of the  load forecast. The borrower shall identify the borrower's member and, as  applicable, member personnel that will serve as project leaders or  liaisons with the authority to make decisions and commit resources  within the scope of the current and future work plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A comprehensive description of the database used in the study.  The narrative shall describe the procedures used to collect, develop,  verify, validate, update, and maintain the data. A data dictionary  thoroughly defining the database shall be included. The borrower shall  make all or parts of the database available or otherwise accessible to  RUS in electronic format, if requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A narrative for each new load forecast or update of a load  forecast discussing the methods and procedures used in the analysis and  modeling of the borrower's electric system loads as provided for in the  load forecast work plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A narrative discussing the borrower's past, existing, and  forecast of future electric system loads. The narrative must identify  and explain substantive assumptions and other pertinent information used  to support the estimates presented in the load forecast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A narrative discussing load forecast uncertainty or alternative  futures that may determine the borrower's actual loads. Examples of  economic scenarios, weather conditions, and other uncertainties that  borrowers may decide to address in their analysis include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Most-probable assumptions, with normal weather;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pessimistic assumptions, with normal weather;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Optimistic assumptions, with normal weather;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Most-probable assumptions, with severe weather;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Most-probable assumptions, with mild weather;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Impacts of wholesale or retail competition; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> new environmental requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A summary of the forecast's results on an annual basis. Include  alternative futures, as applicable. This summary shall be designed to  accommodate the transfer of load forecast information to a borrower's  other planning or loan support documents. Computer-generated forms or  electronic submissions of data are acceptable. Graphs, tables,  spreadsheets or other exhibits shall be included throughout the forecast  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A narrative discussing the coordination activities conducted  between a power supply borrower and its members, as applicable, and  between the borrower and RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with an approved load forecast work plan. A borrower  required to maintain an approved load forecast work plan must also be  able to demonstrate that both it and its RUS borrower members are in  compliance with its approved load forecast work plan for the next load  forecast or update of a load forecast.</p>
