                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The tri-party partnership shall develop, establish, and implement the management systems as described in this subpart. If the State has established a management system for FH that fulfills the requirements in 23 U.S.C. 303, that management system, to the extent applicable, can be used to meet the requirements of this subpart consistent with 23 CFR 660.105(b). The management systems may be tailored to meet the FH program goals, policies, and needs using professional engineering and planning judgment to determine the nature and extent of systems coverage consistent with the intent and requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tri-party partnership shall develop and implement procedures for the acceptance of the existing, or the development, establishment, implementation, and operation of new management systems. The procedures shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A process for ensuring the output of the management systems is considered in the development of the FH program transportation plans and transportation improvement programs, and in making project selection decisions under 23 U.S.C. 204;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A process for the analyses and coordination of all management systems outputs to systematically operate,

maintain, and upgrade existing transportation assets cost-effectively;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of each management system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A process to operate and maintain the management systems and their associated databases; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A process for data collection, processing, analysis, and updating for each management system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All management systems will use databases with a common or coordinated reference system, that can be used to geolocate all database information, to ensure that data across management systems are comparable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Existing data sources may be used by the tri-party partnership to meet the management system requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The tri-party partnership shall develop an appropriate means to evaluate the effectiveness of the management systems in enhancing transportation investment decision-making and improving the overall efficiency of the affected transportation systems and facilities. This evaluation is to be conducted periodically, preferably as part of the FS planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The management systems shall be operated so investment decisions based on management system outputs can be accomplished at the State level.</p>
