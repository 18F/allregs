                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Within the limit of funds available for such purpose,  the awarding official shall make awards for cooperative agreements to  those applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the  announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set  forth in this part. The date specified by the Assistant Administrator  for Cooperative Services as the beginning of the project period shall be  no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the  project is approved and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless  otherwise permitted by law. All funds awarded under this part shall be  expended solely in accordance with the methods identified in approved  application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and  conditions of the award, the Grants and Agreements regulations of the  Department of Agriculture as currently codified in 2 CFR parts 400, 415,  417, 418, and 421.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperative agreement award document and notice of award--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Cooperative agreement award document.

The notice of award of funds for the  cooperative agreement will be in the form of a letter providing  pertinent instructions or information to the cooperator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Types of cooperative agreement instruments. The types of  cooperative agreements shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New agreement. This is an agreement instrument by which RDA or  its successor agency agrees to support a   specified level of effort for a project not supported previously under  this program. This type of agreement is approved on the basis of an RDA  or its successor agency Staff evaluation review and recommendation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renewal agreement. This is an agreement instrument by which RDA  or its successor agency agrees to provide additional funding for a  project beyond the period approved in an original or amended agreement,  provided that the cumulative period does not exceed the statutory  limitation. When a renewal application is submitted, it must include a  summary of progress to date from the previous agreement period.

A  supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of  the original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification to  warrant such action. A request of this nature will not require  additional review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Obligation of the Federal Government. The approval of any  application or the award of any funds for a cooperative agreement shall  not commit nor obligate the United States in any way to make any  renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any  approved application or portion of an approved application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Obligation of the cooperator.
