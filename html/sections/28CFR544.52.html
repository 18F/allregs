Each level may include the following types of  training:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exploratory Training.

Marketable training provides specific  entry-level or advanced job skills. Marketable training may include  ``live work'', that is, the training would result in a product or  service produced by the inmate for actual use by the institution, FPI,  another federal agency, or community service project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Apprentice Training. Apprentice training provides an inmate the  opportunity to participate in training which prepares the inmate for  employment in various trades through structured apprenticeship programs  approved at the state and national levels by the Bureau of  Apprenticeship and Training, U.S. Department of Labor.
