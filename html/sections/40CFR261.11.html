(Waste listed in accordance with these criteria  will be designated Acute Hazardous Waste.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It contains any of the toxic constituents listed in appendix  VIII and, after considering the following factors, the Administrator  concludes that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or  potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly  treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the toxicity presented by the constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The concentration of the constituent in the waste.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The potential of the constituent or any toxic degradation  product of the constituent to migrate from the waste into the  environment under the types of improper management considered in  paragraph (a)(3)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The persistence of the constituent or any toxic degradation  product of the constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The potential for the constituent or any toxic degradation  product of the constituent to degrade into non-harmful constituents and  the rate of degradation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The degree to which the constituent or any degradation product  of the constituent bioaccumulates in ecosystems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The plausible types of improper management to which the waste  could be subjected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The quantities of the waste generated at individual  generation sites or on a regional or national basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The nature and severity of the human health and environmental  damage that has occurred as a result of the improper management of  wastes containing the constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Action taken by other governmental agencies or regulatory  programs based on the health or environmental hazard posed by the waste  or waste constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Such other factors as may be appropriate.  Substances will be listed on appendix VIII only if they have been shown  in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or  teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms.</p><p class="depth4">(Wastes listed in accordance with these criteria will be designated  Toxic wastes.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may list classes or types of solid waste as  hazardous waste if he has reason to believe that individual wastes,  within the class or type of waste, typically or frequently are hazardous  under the definition of hazardous waste found in section 1004(5) of the  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.
