                                Sec. 1.311  General.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Sections 1.311 through 1.325 provide for taking the deposition of  any person (including a party), for interrogatories to parties, and for  orders to parties relating to the production of documents and things and  for entry upon real property. These procedures may be used for the  discovery of relevant facts, for the production and preservation of  evidence for use at the hearing, or for both purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. For purposes of discovery, these proecdures may  be used in any case of adjudication (as defined in the Administrative  Procedure Act) which has been designated for hearing. For the  preservation of evidence, they may be used in any case which has been  designated for hearing and is conducted under the provisions of this  subpart (see Sec. 1.201).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of examination. Persons and parties may be examined  regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the hearing  issues, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition  and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the  identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts. It  is not ground for objection to use of these procedures that the  testimony will be inadmissible at the hearing if the testimony sought  appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence. The use of these procedures against the Commission is subject  to the following additional limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The informer's privilege shall encompass information which may  lead to the disclosure of an informer's identity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commission personnel may not be questioned by deposition for the  purposes of discovery except on special order of the Commission, but may  be questioned by written interrogatories under Sec. 1.323.  Interrogatories shall be served on the appropriate Bureau Chief (see  Sec. 1.21(b)). They will be answered and signed by those personnel with  knowledge of the facts. The answers will be served by the Secretary of  the Commission upon parties to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commission records are not subject to discovery under  Sec. 1.325. The inspection of Commission records is governed by the  Freedom of Information Act, as amended, and by Secs. 0.451 through 0.467  of this chapter. Commission employees may be questioned by written  interrogatories regarding the existence, nature, description, custody,  condition and location of Commission records, but may not be questioned  concerning their contents unless the records are available (or are made  available) for inspection under Secs. 0.451 through 0.467. See  Sec. 0.451(b)(5) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subject to paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section,  Commission personnel may be questioned generally by written  interrogatories regarding   the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of  relevant documents and things and regarding the identity and location of  persons having knowledge of relevant facts, and may otherwise only be  examined regarding facts of the case as to which they have direct  personal knowledge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Schedule for use of the procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In comparative broadcast  proceedings involving applicants for only new facilities, discovery  commences with the release of the hearing designation order, and, in  routine cases, the discovery phase of the proceeding will be conducted  in a manner intended to conclude that portion of the case within 90 days  of the release of the designation order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In all other proceedings, except as provided by special order of  the presiding officer, discovery may be initiated before or after the  prehearing conference provided for in Sec. 1.248 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In all proceedings, the presiding officer may at any time order  the parties or their attorneys to appear at a conference to consider the  proper use of these procedures, the time to be allowed for such use,  and/or to hear agrument and render a ruling on disputes that arise under  these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Who shall act. Actions provided for in Secs. 1.311 through 1.325  will, in most cases, be taken by the officer designated to preside at  the hearing (see Sec. 1.241). If the proceeding, or a particular matter  to which the action relates, is before the Commission, a commissioner or  panel of commissioners, or the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the  action will be taken by such officer or body. The term presiding  officer, as used in Secs. 1.311 through 1.325 shall be understood to  refer to the appropriate officer or body. See Secs. 0.341, 0.351, 0.365,  and 1.271 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Stipulations regarding the taking of depositions. If all of the  parties so stipulate in writing and if there is no interference to the  conduct of the proceeding, depositions may be taken before any person,  at any time (subject to the limitation below) or place, upon any notice  and in any manner, and when so taken may be used like other depositions.  An original and one copy of the stipulation shall be filed with the  Secretary of the Commission, and a copy of the stipulation shall be  served on the presiding officer, at least 3 days before the scheduled  taking of the deposition.
