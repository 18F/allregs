                                Sec. 48.4063-1  Tax-free sales of bodies to chassis manufacturers.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the provisions of section 4063(b), the tax imposed by section  4061(a) shall not apply to bodies sold by the manufacturer thereof to a  manufacturer (but not an importer) of automobile trucks (as defined by  Sec. 48.4061(a)-3(a)) to be sold by the purchaser. Thus, a manufacturer  of automobile truck bodies is permitted to sell such bodies tax free to  manufacturers of automobile truck chassis. This section does not apply  with respect to the sale of an automobile truck chassis to manufacturers  of automobile truck bodies. However, see Sec. 48.4061(a)-1(e) with  respect to the sale of an automobile truck chassis for use in the  manufacture or assembly of a nonhighway vehicle (within the meaning of  Sec. 48.4061(a)-1(d)). In order to effect a tax-free sale of a body as  provided in this section, both the seller and purchaser must comply with  the registration and other requirements of section 4222 and the  regulations thereunder. A chassis manufacturer who purchases a body tax  free as provided in this section shall, for purposes of application of  the tax imposed by section 4061(a), be considered the manufacturer of  such body.  [T.D. 7461, 42 FR 2675, Jan. 13, 1977]</p>
