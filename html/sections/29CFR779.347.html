                                Sec. 779.347  Exemption limited to ``recognized retail establishment''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The section 13(a)(4) exemption requires the establishment to be  recognized as a retail establishment in the particular industry. This  test limits the exemption to retail establishments only, and excludes  factories as such and establishments to which the retail concept does  not apply. In other words this test requires that the establishment as a  whole be recognized as a retail establishment although it makes or  processes at the establishment the goods it sells. Typical of the  establishment which may be recognized as retail establishments under the  exemption are custom tailor shops, candy shops, ice cream parlors,  bakeries, drug stores, optometrist establishments, retail ice plants and  other local retail establishments which make or process the goods they  sell and meet the other tests for exemption. Clearly factories as such  are not ``recognized retail establishments'' and would not be eligible  for this exemption. (See 95 Cong. Rec. pp. 11001, 11200, 11216, and  14942.)</p>
