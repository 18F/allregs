                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NSF is a special team established by the USCG, including the  three USCG Strike Teams, the Public Information Assist Team (PIAT), and  the NSFCC. The NSF is available to assist OSCs/RPMs in their  preparedness and response duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The three Strike Teams (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) provide  trained personnel and specialized equipment to assist the OSC in  training for spill response, stabilizing and containing the spill, and  in monitoring or directing the response actions of the responsible  parties and/or contractors. The OSC has a specific team designated for  initial contact and may contact that team directly for any assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Technical assistance, equipment and other resources to augment  the OSC staff during spill response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public  resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a  worst case discharge of oil.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation  of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public  agencies and private organizations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Assistance in locating spill response resources for both  response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international  computerized inventory of spill response resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response  equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> PIAT is an element of the NSFCC staff which is available to  assist OSCs to meet the demands for public information during a response  or exercise. Its use is encouraged any time the OSC requires outside  public affairs support. Requests for PIAT assistance may be made through  the NSFCC or NRC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Environmental Response Team (ERT) is established by EPA  in accordance with its disaster and emergency responsibilities. The ERT  has expertise in treatment technology, biology, chemistry, hydrology,  geology, and engineering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ERT can provide access to special decontamination equipment  for chemical releases and advice to the OSC/RPM in hazard evaluation;  risk assessment; multimedia sampling and analysis program; on-site  safety, including development and implementation plans; cleanup  techniques and priorities; water supply decontamination and protection;  application of dispersants; environmental assessment; degree of cleanup  required; and disposal of contaminated material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ERT also provides both introductory and intermediate level  training courses to prepare response personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> OSC/RPM or RRT requests for ERT support should be made to the  EPA representative on the RRT; EPA Headquarters, Director, Emergency  Response Division; or the appropriate EPA regional emergency  coordinator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scientific Support Coordinators (SSCs) may be designated by the  OSC (and RPM in the case of EPA SSCs) as the principal advisors for  scientific issues, communication with the scientific community, and  coordination of requests for assistance from state and federal agencies  regarding scientific studies. The SSC strives for a consensus on  scientific issues affecting the response, but ensures that differing  opinions within the community are communicated to the OSC/RPM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally, SSCs are provided by NOAA in the coastal zones, and  by EPA in the inland zone. OSC/RPM requests for SSC support can be made  directly to the SSC assigned to the area or to the agency member of the  RRT. NOAA SSCs can also be requested through NOAA's SSC program office  in Seattle, WA. NOAA SSCs are assigned to USCG Districts and are  supported by a scientific support team that includes expertise in  environmental chemistry, oil slick tracking, pollutant transport  modeling, natural resources at risk, environmental tradeoffs of  countermeasures and cleanup, and information management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During a response, the SSC serves on the federal OSC's/RPM's  staff and may, at the request of the OSC/RPM, lead the scientific team  and be responsible for providing scientific support for operational  decisions and for coordinating on-scene scientific activity. Depending  on the nature and location of the incident, the SSC integrates expertise  from governmental agencies, universities, community representatives, and  industry to assist the OSC/RPM in evaluating the hazards and potential  effects of releases and in developing response strategies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At the request of the OSC, the SSC may facilitate the OSC's work  with the lead administrative trustee for natural resources to ensure  coordination between damage assessment data collection efforts and data  collected in support of response operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> SSCs support the Regional Response Teams and the Area Committees  in preparing regional and area contingency plans and in conducting spill  training and exercises. For area plans, the SSC provides leadership for  the synthesis and integration of environmental information required for  spill response decisions in support of the OSC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SUPSALV has an extensive salvage/search and recovery  equipment inventory with the requisite knowledge and expertise to  support these operations, including specialized salvage, firefighting,  and petroleum, oil and lubricants offloading capability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When possible, SUPSALV will provide equipment for training  exercises in support of national and regional contingency planning  objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The OSC/RPM may request assistance directly from SUPSALV. Formal  requests are routed through the Chief of Naval Operations (N312).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For marine salvage operations, OSCs/RPMs with responsibility for  monitoring, evaluating, or supervising these activities should request  technical assistance from DOD, the Strike Teams, or commercial salvors  as necessary to ensure that proper actions are taken. Marine salvage  operations generally fall into five categories: afloat salvage; offshore  salvage; river and harbor clearance; cargo salvage; and rescue towing.  Each category requires different knowledge and specialized types of  equipment. The complexity of such operations may be further compounded  by local environmental and geographic conditions. The nature of marine  salvage and the conditions under which it occurs combine to make such  operations imprecise, difficult, hazardous, and expensive. Thus,  responsible parties or other persons attempting to perform such  operations without adequate knowledge, equipment, and experience could  aggravate, rather than relieve, the situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Radiological Emergency Response Teams (RERTs) have been  established by EPA's Office of Radiation Programs (ORP) to provide  response and support for incidents or sites containing radiological  hazards. Expertise is available in radiation monitoring, radionuclide  analysis, radiation health physics, and risk assessment. RERTs can  provide on-site support including mobile monitoring laboratories for  field analyses of samples and fixed laboratories for radiochemical  sampling and analyses. Requests for support may be made 24 hours a day  via the NRC or directly to the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator in  the Office of Radiation Programs. Assistance is also available from DOE  and other federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DRGs assist the OSC by providing technical assistance,  personnel, and equipment, including pre-positioned equipment. Each DRG  consists of all Coast Guard personnel and equipment, including marine  firefighting equipment, in its district, additional pre-positioned  equipment, and a District Response Advisory Team (DRAT) that is  available to provide support to the OSC in the event that a spill  exceeds local response capabilities. Each DRG:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall provide technical assistance, equipment, and other  resources, as available, when requested by an OSC through the USCG  representative to the RRT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall ensure maintenance of all USCG response equipment within  its district;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May provide technical assistance in the preparation of the  ACP; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Shall review each of those plans that affect its area of  geographic responsibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In deciding where to locate personnel and pre-positioned  equipment, the USCG shall give priority emphasis to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The availability of facilities for loading and unloading heavy  or bulky equipment by barge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proximity to an airport capable of supporting large  military transport aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The flight time to provide response to oil spills in all areas  of the Coast Guard district with the potential for marine casualties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The availability of trained local personnel capable of  responding in an oil spill emergency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Areas where large quantities of petroleum products are  transported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The NPFC is responsible for implementing those portions of Title  I of the OPA that have been delegated to the Secretary of the department  in which the Coast Guard is operating. The NPFC is responsible for  addressing funding issues arising from discharges and threats of  discharges of oil. The NPFC:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issues Certificates of Financial Responsibility to owners and  operators of vessels to pay for costs and damages that are incurred by  their vessels as a result of oil discharges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provides funding for various response organizations for timely  abatement and removal actions related to oil discharges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides equitable compensation to claimants who sustain costs  and damages from oil discharges when the responsible party fails to do  so;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recovers monies from persons liable for costs and damages  resulting from oil discharges to the full extent of liability under the  law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provides funds to initiate natural resource damage assessments.</p>
