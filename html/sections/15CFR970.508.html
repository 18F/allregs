Such notice will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis upon which the Administrator proposes to deny issuance or transfer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the basis for the proposed denial is a deficiency which the Administrator believes the applicant can correct:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The action believed necessary to correct the deficiency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The time within which any correctable deficiency must be corrected (the period of time may not exceed 180 days except as specified by the Administrator for good cause).

The Federal Register notice will not include the coordinates of the proposed exploration area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will deny issuance or transfer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the 30th day after the date the notice is sent to the applicant under paragraph (b) of this section, unless before such 30th day the applicant files with the Administrator a written request for an administrative review of the proposed denial; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the last day of the period established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section in which the applicant must correct a deficiency, if such deficiency has not been corrected before

If the proposed denial is the result of a correctable deficiency, the administrative review will proceed concurrently with any attempt to correct the deficiency, unless the parties agree otherwise or the administrative law judge orders differently.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Administrator denies issuance or transfer, he will send to the applicant written notice of the denial, including the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any final determination by the Administrator granting or denying issuance of a license is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.
