In those situations where the parties are not able to achieve  resolution, the Department favors the use of alternative dispute  resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve protests. A protest requesting a  decision at the Headquarters level shall state whether the protester is  willing to utilize ADR techniques such as mediation or nonbinding  evaluation of the protest by a neutral party. Both the protester and the  Department must agree that the use of such techniques is   appropriate. If the parties do not mutually agree to utilize ADR  techniques to resolve the protest, the protest will be processed in  accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Upon receipt of a protest lodged with the Department, the  contracting officer shall prepare a report similar to that discussed in  48 CFR 33.104(a)(3)(iv). The Senior Procurement Executive (for protests  at the Headquarters level or those specific HCA protests cited in  paragraph (i) of this section) or an HCA (for protests at the  contracting activity level) will render a decision on a protest within  35 calendar days, unless a longer period of time is determined to be  needed.
