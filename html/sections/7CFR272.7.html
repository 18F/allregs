                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. To achieve the efficient and effective administration  of the Food Stamp Program in rural areas of Alaska, FNS has determined  that it is necessary to develop additional regulations which are  specifically designed to accommodate the unique demographic and climatic  characteristics which exist in these rural areas. The regulations  established in this section, except for paragraph (f) of this section,  shall apply only in those areas of Alaska designated as ``rural'' in  paragraph (b) of this section. All regulations not specifically modified  by this section shall remain in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Area Designations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rural I Alaska TFP refers to a Thrifty  Food Plan (TFP) that is the higher of the TFP that was in effect in each  area on October 1, 1985, or 28.52 percent higher than the Anchorage TFP,  as calculated by FNS, with rounding and other reductions that are  appropriate. It is to be used in the following areas: In all places in  Kodiak Island Borough with the exception of Kodiak; in all places in the  Kenai Peninsula Borough that are west of Cook Inlet (including Tyonek,  Kustatan, Kalgin Island, Iliamna, Chenik, and Augustine Island) and  Chugach Island, English Bay, Port Graham, Portlock, Pt. Gore, Pye  Island, and Seldovia. In the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, the city of  Nenana; and Skwentna in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. In the Valdez- Cordova Census Area, all places except Dayville and Valdez; and in the  Southeast Fairbanks Census Area all places except Big Delta, Delta  Junction, and Fort Greely. In the Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area,  all places except Skagway; in Sitka Borough all places except Sitka; in  the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, all places except Wrangell and  Petersburg; in the Ketchikan Gateway Borough, all places except  Ketchikan, Saxman, and Ward Cove; in the Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan  Census Area, all places except Craig, Hyder, and Metlakatla.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rural II Alaska TFP refers to a TFP that is 56.42 percent higher  than the Anchorage TFP, as calculated by FNS, with rounding and other  reductions that are appropriate. It is to be used in the following  areas: North Slope Borough; Kobuk Census Area; Nome Census Area; Yukon- Koyukuk Census Area except for the city of Nenana; Wade Hampton Census  Area; Bethel Census Area; Denali in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough;  Dillingham-Bristol Bay Borough; and in all places in the Aleutian  Islands except for Cold Bay and Adak.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Urban Alaska TFP refers to a TFP that is the higher of the TFP  that was in effect in each area on October 1, 1985, or .79 percent  higher than the Anchorage TFP, as calculated by FNS, with rounding and  other reductions that are appropriate. It is to be used in the following  areas: Cold Bay and Adak in the Aleutian Islands; Kodiak in Kodiak  Island Borough; Valdez and Dayville in the Valdez-Cordova Census Area;  all places in Kenai Peninsula Borough that are on the Kenai Peninsula  except for those specifically designated as Rural I; the entire  Anchorage Borough; the entire Matanuska-Susitna Borough except for  Denali and Skwentna; the entire Fairbanks-North Star Borough; the entire  Juneau Borough; the entire Haines Borough; Sitka   in the Sitka Borough; Skagway in the Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area;  Wrangell and Petersburg in the Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area;  Ketchikan, Saxman, and Ward Cove in the Ketchikan-Gateway Borough;  Craig, Hyder, and Metlakatla in the Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan  Census Area; and Big Delta, Delta Junction, and Fort Greely in the  Southeast-Fairbanks Census Area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The State agency may, in consultation with FNS, change the  designation of any Alaska subdivision contained in the Plan of Operation  to reflect changes in demographics or the cost of food within the  subdivision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee agents. ``Fee agent'' means a paid agent who, on behalf of  the State, is authorized to make applications available to low-income  households, assist in the completion of applications, conduct required  interviews, secure required verification, forward completed applications  and supporting documentation to the State agency, and provide other  services as required by the State agency. Such services shall not  include making final decisions on household eligibility or benefit  levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application processing. The State agency may modify the  application processing requirements in Sec. 273.2 of this chapter as  necessary to insure prompt delivery of services to eligible households.  The following restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fee agent processing. If the signed application is first  submitted by a household to a fee agent, the fee agent shall mail the  application to the State agency within 5 days of receipt. The fee agent  shall give the household the maximum amount of time to provide needed  verification as long as the five-day processing period is met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application filing date. An application is considered filed for  purposes of timely processing when it is received by an office of the  State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application processing timeframes. Eligible households must be  provided an opportunity to participate as soon as possible but no later  than 30 days after the application is received by an office of the State  agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expedited service. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the signed application is first  submitted by a household to a fee agent, the fee agent shall mail the  application to the State agency within 5 days of receipt. If the  household is eligible for expedited service, the State agency will mail  the coupons no later than the close of business of the second working  day following the date the application was received by the State agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the signed application is submitted directly to the State  agency in person by a rural resident or its authorized representative or  by mail, the State agency shall process the application and issue  coupons to households eligible for expedited service in accordance with  the time standards contained in Sec. 273.2(i)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an incomplete application is submitted directly to the  State agency by mail, the State agency shall conduct the interview by  the first working day following the date the application was received if  the fee agent can contact the household or the household can be reached  by telephone or radio-phone and does not object to this method of  interviewing on grounds of privacy. Based on information obtained during  the interview, the State agency shall complete the application and  process the case. Because of the mailing time in rural areas, the State  agency shall not return the completed application to the household for  signature. The processing standard shall be calculated from the date the  application was filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> SSI Joint Processing. SSA workers shall mail all jointly  processed applications to the appropriate State agency office within 5  days of receipt of the application. A jointly processed application  shall be considered filed for purposes of timely processing when it is  received by an office of the State agency. The household, if determined  eligible, shall receive benefits retroactive to the first day of the  month in which the jointly processed application was received by the SSA  worker.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interviews. The State agency shall interview applicant  households in the most efficient manner possible, either by face-to-face  contact, telephone, radiophone, or other means of correspondence  including written correspondence. In instances in which an interview  cannot be conducted, the   State agency may postpone the interview until after the household is  certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determining household eligibility and benefit level. If a  household submits its application to a fee agent, it shall, if eligible,  receive benefits retroactive to the date the application is received by  the fee agent. If a household submits its application directly to a  State agency office, it shall, if determined eligible, receive benefits  retroactive to the date the application is received by the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vehicles. In areas of the State where there are no licensing  requirements, snowmobiles and boats used by the household for basic  transportation shall be evaluated in accordance with Sec. 273.8(h) of  this chapter even though they are unlicensed. Vehicles necessary for  subsistence hunting and fishing shall not be counted as a household  resource.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reporting changes. The State agency shall allow the household to  choose to report changes either directly to the State agency or to the  fee agent. If the household reports the change to the fee agent, the fee  agent will mail the change report to the State agency office within two  working days of the date of receipt. The household's obligation to  report the change will have been met if it submits the change to the fee  agent within 10 days of the date the change becomes known to the  household. However, for purposes of State agency action for increasing  or decreasing benefits, the change will be considered to have been  reported when it is received by a State agency office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fair hearings, fraud hearings, and agency conferences. The State  agency shall conduct fair hearings, administrative fraud hearings, and  agency conferences with households that wish to contest denial of  expedited service in the most efficient manner possible, either by face- to-face contact, telephone, radiophone, or other means of correspondence  including written correspondence, in order to meet the respective time  standards contained in Sec. Sec. 273.15 and 273.16 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Issuance services. With the approval of FNS, coupons may be  mailed on a quarterly or semiannual basis to certain rural areas of  Alaska when provisions are not available on a monthly basis. The  decision to allow the distribution of coupons in this manner will be  made on an annual basis. These areas shall be listed in the State's Plan  of Operation. The State agency shall advise households that live in  rural areas where quarterly or semiannual allotments are authorized. If,  as the result of the issuance of quarterly or semiannual allotments,  food coupons are overissued or underissued, the State agency shall  process claim determinations and restore lost benefits.
