                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to gain access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by CFA must submit their request in writing in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. (1) Content of the request. The request for access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the Secretary, at the address cited above; and shall name the system of records or contain a description (as concise as possible) of such system of records. The request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of such a statement, if the request is for a record pertaining to the requester maintained by CFA in a system of records, the request will be presumed to be made under the Privacy Act of 1974. The requester should include any other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Content of the request.

The requester should include any other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of employment, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for identification will normally be limited to the presentation of any standard picture and signature or signature identification card, such as driver's license, so that a comparison of the signature and the signature on the original request may be made. The appearing individual will be read paragraph (3), subsection (i) to title 5 U.S.C. 552a which specifies the penalty for knowingly or willfully requesting or obtaining a record concerning an individual from an agency under false pretenses and asked to sign a statement attesting to the fact that he or she understands the paragraph and that he or she is, in fact, the individual who made the request (or the individual authorized to receive the disclosure by the requesting individual). This signature will be compared with the other two. If the appearing individual is other than the requesting individual, then he or she must also present a letter of introduction signed by the requesting individual so that the comparison of signature may be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CFA action on request. (1) A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays), except when the Secretary determines otherwise, in which case the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay and an anticipated date by which the request will be answered. When the request can be answered within 10 days, it shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for access will ordinarily be answered within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays), except when the Secretary determines otherwise, in which case the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay and an anticipated date by which the request will be answered. When the request can be answered within 10 days, it shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by CFA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement as to whether access will be granted only by providing a copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time, alternate arrangements may be made with the official specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will be the sole means of granting access only when the Secretary has determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of fees charged, if any (see Sec. Sec. 2106.4 and 2106.7); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name, title, and telephone number of the CFR official having operational control over the record.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Access by the parent of a minor, or legal guardian. A parent of a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may access on behalf of the minor any record pertaining to the minor maintained by CFA in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the presentation of documents authorizing the legal guardian to so act; and upon suitable personal identification of the guardian.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Granting access when accompanied or represented by another individual. When an individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records maintained by CFA wishes to be accompanied or represented by another individual during the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the request shall submit to the official having operational control of the record a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Access in response to congressional inquiries. Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of that individual.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Medical records. The records in a system of records which are medical records shall be disclosed to the individual in such a manner and following such procedures as the Secretary shall direct. When CFA, in consultation with a physician, determines that the disclosure of medical information could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, CFA may transmit such information to a physician named by the individual.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Exceptions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
