                            <p class="depth0">Search services are services of agency personnel--clerical or professional--used in trying to find the records, that are responsive to a request. Search services includes both manual and electronic searches and time spent examining records for the purpose of finding information that is within the scope of the request. Search services also include services to transport personnel to places of record storage, or records to the location of personnel for the purpose of the search, if such services are reasonably necessary.
