                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, you must  conduct a performance test for existing and new sources at a large  copper or other nonferrous foundry that is subject to Sec. 63.11550(b).  You must conduct the test within 180 days of your compliance date and  report the results in your Notification of Compliance Status according  to Sec. 63.9(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>,  you are not required to conduct a performance test if a prior  performance test was conducted within the past 5 years of the compliance  date using the same methods specified in paragraph (c) of this section  and you meet either of the following two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No process changes have been made since the test; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority  that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments,  reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and  (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must determine the concentration of PM (for the  concentration standard) or the mass rate of PM in pounds per hour at the  inlet and outlet of the control device (for the percent reduction  standard) according to the following test methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1) to select sampling  port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct.  If you are complying with the concentration provision in  Sec. 63.11550(b), sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the  control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere. If you are  complying with the percent reduction provision in Sec. 63.11550(b),  sampling sites must be located at the inlet and outlet of the control  device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1), or  Method 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to determine the volumetric  flow rate of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to  determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by  reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) to determine the  moisture content of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method 5 or 5D (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) or Method 17 (40  CFR part 60, appendix A-6) to determine the concentration of PM or mass  rate of PM (front half filterable catch only). If you choose to comply  with the percent reduction PM standard, you must determine the mass rate  of PM at the inlet and outlet in pounds per hour and calculate the  percent reduction in PM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Three valid test runs are needed to comprise a performance test.  Each run must cover at least one production cycle (charging, melting,  and tapping).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a source with a single control device exhausted through  multiple stacks, you must ensure that three runs are performed by a  representative sampling of the stacks satisfactory to the Administrator  or his or her delegated representative. You must provide data or an  adequate explanation why the stack(s) chosen for testing are  representative.</p>
