                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources  who seek to comply with the emission standard in Sec.  63.642(g) by  using emissions averaging according to Sec.  63.642(l) rather than  following the provisions of Sec. Sec.  63.643 through 63.647, and  Sec. Sec.  63.650 and 63.651. Existing marine tank vessel loading  operations located at the Valdez Marine Terminal source may not comply  with the standard by using emissions averaging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an  Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in Sec.   63.653(d) for all points to be included in an emissions average. The  Implementation Plan shall identify all emission points to be included in  the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to  which the reference control technology (defined in Sec.  63.641) is not  applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the  average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The following emission points can be used to generate emissions  averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if  sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value  of credits for the emission point:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Group 2 emission points;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Group 1 storage vessels, Group 1 wastewater streams, Group 1  gasoline loading racks, Group 1 marine tank vessels, and Group 1  miscellaneous process vents that are controlled by a technology that the  Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a   higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology.  Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be  submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution  prevention measures. Percentages of reduction for pollution prevention  measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure  must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would  have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission  point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with  other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention  measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference  control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention  measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference  control technology would have had it been applied instead.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The following emission points cannot be used to generate  emissions averaging credits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Emission points already controlled on or before November 15,  1990 unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990,  in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control  after November 15, 1990;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference  control technology unless the reference control technology has been  approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency  has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this  section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal  floating roof meeting only the specifications stated in the reference  control technology definition in Sec.  63.641 (i.e., that meets the  specifications of Sec.  63.119(b) of subpart G but does not have  controlled fittings per Sec.  63.119 (b)(5) and (b)(6) of subpart G)  applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent  control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Emission points on shutdown process units. Process units that  are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams  treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater  cannot be used to generate credits or debits. Group 1 wastewater streams  cannot be left undercontrolled or uncontrolled to generate debits. For  the purposes of this section, the terms ``wastewater'' and ``wastewater  stream'' are used to mean process wastewater; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal  rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been  increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other  State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the  other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission  point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an  approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject  to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can  continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of  complying with the previously approved average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or  operator shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission  points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference  control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g)  of this section shall be used to calculate debits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2  emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits.  Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate  credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of  paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation,  whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be  included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to  paragraph (h)   of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the  same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan that  credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating  sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating  emission points must be made under representative operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used  for all debit and credit calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month)  period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30  times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph  (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined  based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30  percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the  Periodic Reports as specified in Sec.  63.655(g)(8). Every fourth  Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the  emissions averaging provisions as required by Sec.  63.655(g)(8)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the  methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this  section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section)  are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions  average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average.  For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions  average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may  include up to 22 emission points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction as described in  the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by Sec.   63.6(e)(3) of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission  point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating  emission point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (l)  of this section to demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial  credits or debits should be assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Debits are generated by the difference between the actual  emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is  controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control  technology, and the emissions allowed for Group 1 emission point.
