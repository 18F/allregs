                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an enclosure for a motor, master switch, or other equipment has an electric heater inside the enclosure that is energized from a separate circuit, the heater circuit must be disconnected from its source of potential by a disconnect device independent of the enclosure containing the heater. The heater disconnecting device must be adjacent to the equipment disconnecting device. A fixed sign, warning the operator to open both devices, must be on the enclosure of the equipment disconnect device, except as in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the location of the enclosure for a motor, master switch, or other equipment for deck machinery is remote from the motor and controller disconnect device, a sign must be fixed to the enclosure if the disconnect arrangement required by paragraph (a) of this section is not used. The sign must warn the operator of the presence of two sources of potential within the enclosure and show the location of the heater circuit disconnect device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electric heaters installed within motor controllers and energized from a separate circuit must be disconnected in the same manner as required by paragraph (a) of this section or by Sec.  111.70-7(d).
