                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to  transferee. A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide notice to  the transferee if either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferee is furnished with a non-U.S. real property  interest statement pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(c)(3) and the agent knows  that the statement is false; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and either (i) the agent knows that the  certification is false, or (ii) the agent represents a transferor that  is a foreign corporation. An agent that represents a transferor that is  a foreign corporation is not required to provide notice to the  transferee if the foreign corporation provided a non-foreign  certification to the transferee prior to such agent's employment and the  agent does not know that the corporation did so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duty to provide notice of false certification or statement to  entity or fiduciary. A transferee's or transferor's agent must provide  notice to an entity or fiduciary that plans to carry out a transaction  described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4) if either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-U.S. real  property interest statement pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(4)(iii) and the  agent knows that such statement is false; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The entity or fiduciary is furnished with a non-foreign  certification pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(3) (ii) and either (i) the  agent knows that such certification is false, or (ii) the agent  represents a foreign corporation that made such a certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedural requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice to transferee, entity, or  fiduciary. An agent who is required by this section to provide notice  must do so in writing as soon as possible after learning of the false  certification or statement, but not later than the date of the transfer  (prior to the transferee's payment of consideration). If an agent first  learns of a false certification or statement after the date of the  transfer, notice must be given by the third day following that  discovery. The notice must state that the certification or statement is  false and may not be relied upon. The notice must also explain the  possible consequences to the recipient of a failure to withhold. The  notice need not disclose the information on which the agent's statement  is based. The following is an example of an acceptable notice.``This is  to notify you that you may be required to withhold tax in connection  with (describe transaction). You have been provided with a certification  of non-foreign status (or a non-U.S. real property interest statement)  in connection with that transaction. I have learned that that document  is false. Therefore, you may not rely upon it as a basis for failing to  withhold under section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1445  provides that any person who acquires a U.S. real property interest from  a foreign person must withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the total  purchase price. (The term `U.S. real property interest' includes real  property, stock in U.S. corporations whose assets are primarily real  property, and some personal property associated with realty.) Any person  who is required to withhold but fails to do so can be held liable for  the tax. Thus, if you do not withhold the 10 percent tax from the total  that you pay on this transaction you could   be required to pay the tax yourself, if what you are acquiring is a U.S.  real property interest and the transferor is a foreign person. Tax that  is withheld must be promptly paid over to the IRS using Form 8288. For  further information see sections 897 and 1445 of the Internal Revenue  Code and the related regulations.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> and (e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> is limited to the amount of compensation that that agent  derives from the transaction. In addition, an agent who assists in the  preparation of, or fails to disclose knowledge of, a false certification  or statement may be liable for civil or criminal penalties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definition of transferor's or transferee's agent--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. For purposes of this section, the terms ``transferor's agent''  and ``transferee's agent'' means any person who represents the  transferor or transferee (respectively)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In any negotiation with another person (or another person's  agent) relating to the transaction; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In settling the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transactions subject to section 1445(e). In the case of  transactions subject section 1445(e), the following definitions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term ``transferor's agent'' means any person that represents  or advises an entity or fiduciary with respect to the planning,  arrangement, or consummation by the entity of a transaction described in  section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``transferee's agent'' means any person that  represents or advises the holder of an interest in an entity with  respect to the planning, arrangement or consummation by the entity of a  transaction described in section 1445(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion of settlement officers and clerical personnel. For  purposes of this section, a person shall not be treated as a  transferor's agent or transferee's agent with respect to any transaction  solely because such person performs one or more of the following  activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The receipt and disbursement of any portion of the consideration  for the transaction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recording of any document in connection with the  transaction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Typing, copying, and other clerical tasks;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The obtaining of title insurance reports and reports concerning  the condition of the real property that is the subject of the  transaction; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The transmission or delivery of documents between the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exclusion for governing body of a condominium association and  the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation. The members  of a board, committee or other governing body of a condominium  association and the board of directors and officers of a cooperative  housing corporation will not be deemed agents of the transferor or  transferee if such individuals function   exclusively in their capacity as representatives of such association or  corporation with respect to the transaction. In addition, the managing  agent of a cooperative housing corporation or condominium association  will not be deemed to be an agent of the transferee or transferor if  such person functions exclusively in its capacity as a managing agent.  If a person's activities include advising the transferee or transferor  with respect to the transfer, this exclusion shall not apply.
