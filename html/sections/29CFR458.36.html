                            <p class="depth0">The prohibitions against holding office or employment in a labor organization contained in section 504(a) of the LMRDA are incorporated into this subpart by reference and made a part hereof. The prohibitions shall also be applicable to any person who has been convicted of, or who has served any part of a prison term resulting from his conviction of, violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 by making a false statement in any report required to be filed pursuant to this subpart, or who has been determined by the Director after an appropriate proceeding pursuant to Sec. Sec. 458.66 through 458.92 to have willfully violated Sec. 458.27: Provided, however, That the Director or such other person as he may designate may exempt a person from the prohibition against holding office or employment or may reduce the period of the prohibition where he determines that it would not be contrary to the purposes of the CSRA or the FSA and this section to permit a person barred from holding office or employment to hold such office or employment.
