                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Consent must be obtained from the competent authorities of the relevant OECD countries of import and transit prior to exporting hazardous waste destined for recovery operations subject to this subpart. Hazardous wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section; and wastes not identified on any list are subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amber wastes. Exports of hazardous wastes from the United States as described in Sec. 262.80(a) that are subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless the notification and consent requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transactions requiring specific consent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification. At least forty-five (45) days prior to commencement of each transboundary movement, the exporter must provide written notification in English of the proposed transboundary movement to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words ``Attention: OECD Export Notification'' prominently displayed on the envelope. This notification must include all of the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section. In cases where wastes having similar physical and chemical characteristics, the same United Nations classification, the same RCRA waste codes, and are to be sent periodically to the same recovery facility by the same exporter, the exporter may submit one general notification of intent to export these wastes in multiple shipments during a period of up to one (1) year. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to Sec. 262.84.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tacit consent. If no objection has been lodged by any countries concerned (i.e., exporting, importing, or transit) to a notification provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section within thirty (30) days after the date of issuance of the Acknowledgement of Receipt of notification by the competent authority of the country of import, the transboundary movement may commence. Tacit consent expires one (1) calendar year after the close of the thirty (30) day period; renotification and renewal of all consents is required for exports after that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Written consent. If the competent authorities of all the relevant OECD importing and transit countries provide written consent in a period less than thirty (30) days, the transboundary movement may commence immediately after all necessary consents are received. Written consent expires for each relevant OECD importing and transit country one (1) calendar year after the date of that country's consent unless otherwise specified; renotification and renewal of each expired consent is required for exports after that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transboundary movements to facilities pre-approved by the competent authorities of the importing countries to accept specific wastes for recovery:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification. The exporter must provide EPA a notification that contains all the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section in English, at least ten (10) days in advance of commencing shipment to a pre-approved facility. The notification must indicate that the recovery facility is pre-approved, and may apply to a single specific shipment or to multiple shipments as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. This information must be sent to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words ``OECD Export Notification--Pre-approved Facility'' prominently displayed on the envelope. General notifications that cover multiple shipments as described in paragraph

(b)(1)(i) of this section may cover a period of up to three (3) years. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to Sec. 262.84.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exports to pre-approved facilities may take place after the elapse of seven (7) working days from the issuance of an Acknowledgement of Receipt of the notification by the competent authority of the country of import unless the exporter has received information indicating that the competent authority of any countries concerned objects to the shipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Wastes not covered in the OECD Green and Amber lists. Wastes destined for recovery operations, that have not been assigned to the OECD Green and Amber lists, incorporated by reference in Sec. 262.89(d), but which are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in Sec. 262.80(a), are subject to the notification and consent requirements established for the Amber control procedures in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Wastes destined for recovery operations, that have not been assigned to the OECD Green and Amber lists incorporated by reference in Sec. 262.89(d), and are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined by Sec. 262.80(a) are subject to the Green control procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notifications submitted under this section must include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(14) of this section: (1) Serial number or other accepted identifier of the notification document;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exporter name and EPA identification number (if applicable), address, telephone, fax numbers, and e-mail address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Importing recovery facility name, address, telephone, fax numbers, e-mail address, and technologies employed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Importer name (if not the owner or operator of the recovery facility), address, telephone, fax numbers, and e-mail address; whether the importer will engage in waste exchange recovery operation R12 or waste accumulation recovery operation R13 prior to delivering the waste to the final recovery facility and identification of recovery operations to be employed at the final recovery facility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intended transporter(s) and/or their agent(s); address, telephone, fax, and e-mail address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Country of export and relevant competent authority, and point of departure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Countries of transit and relevant competent authorities and points of entry and departure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Country of import and relevant competent authority, and point of entry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Statement of whether the notification is a single notification or a general notification.

As soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the completion of recovery and no later than one (1) calendar year following receipt of the waste, the U.S. recovery facility shall send a certificate of recovery to the exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and import by mail, e-
