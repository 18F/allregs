Such contributions are distinguishable from (a) monies or other valuables belonging to specific patients which are accepted and held in custody for the convenience of the patient until such time as he or she wishes to withdraw them, and (b) gifts to the United States to support Public Health Service functions under section 501 of the Public Health Service Act or other statutory provisions, which may be accepted and administered only in accordance with such statutory provisions or other applicable laws.</p>
