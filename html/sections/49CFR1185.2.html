                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each application shall state the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The full name, occupation, business address, place of residence,  and post office address of the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A specification of every carrier of which the applicant holds  stock, bonds, or notes, individually, as trustee, or otherwise; and the  amount of, and accurate description of, such securities of each carrier  for which the applicant seeks authority to act. (Whenever it is  contemplated that the applicant will represent on the board of directors  of any carrier securities other than those owned by the applicant, the  application shall describe such securities, state the character of  representation, the name of the beneficial owner or owners, and the  general nature of the business conducted by such owner or owners.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each and every position with any carrier:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Which is held by the applicant at the time of the application;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Which the applicant seeks authority to hold, together with the  date and manner of his or her election or appointment thereto and, if  the applicant has entered upon the performance of his duties in any such  position, the nature of the duties so performed and the date when he  first entered upon their performance. (A decision authorizing a person  to hold the position of director of a carrier will be construed as  sufficient to authorize that person to serve also as chairman of its  board of directors or as a member or chairman of any committee or  committees of such board; and, therefore, when authority is sought to  hold the position of director, the applicant need not request authority  to serve in any of such other capacities.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As to each carrier covered by the requested authorization,  whether it is an operating carrier, a lessor company, or any other  corporation organized for the purpose of engaging in rail  transportation. (If any such carrier neither operates nor owns any  railroad providing transportation that is subject to 49 U.S.C. 10501,  the application shall include a copy of such carrier's charter or  certificate or articles of incorporation, with amendments to date or, if  already filed with the former Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) or  with the STB, a reference thereto, with any intervening amendments.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A full statement of pertinent facts relative to any carrier  involved which does not make annual reports to the STB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Full information as to the relationship--operating, financial,  competitive, or otherwise--existing between the carriers covered by the  requested authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Every corporation--industrial, financial, or miscellaneous--of  which the applicant is an officer or director, and the general character  of the business conducted by such corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The reasons, fully, why the granting of the authority sought  will not affect adversely either public or private interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Whether or not any other application for authority has been made  in behalf of the applicant and, if so, the date and docket number  thereof, by whom made, and the action thereon, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When application has been made on behalf of any person, a  subsequent application by that person need not repeat any statement  contained in the previous application but may incorporate the same by  appropriate reference.</p>
