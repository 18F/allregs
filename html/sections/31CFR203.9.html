A  financial institution is not required to be designated as a TT&L;  depositary in order to process electronic Federal tax payments. In  addition, a financial institution does not become a TT&L; depositary by  processing electronic Federal tax payments under this subpart and may  not represent itself as a TT&L; depositary because it does so.</p>
