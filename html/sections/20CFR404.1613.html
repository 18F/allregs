                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A State agency will make determinations of disability with respect to all persons in the State except those individuals whose cases are in a class specifically excluded by our written guidelines. A determination of disability made by the State is the determination of the Commissioner, except as described in Sec. 404.1503(d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New classes of cases. Where any new class or classes of cases arise requiring determinations of disability, we will determine the conditions under which a State may choose not to make the disability determinations. We will provide the State with the necessary funding to do the additional work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporary transfer of classes of cases. We will make disability determinations for classes of cases temporarily transferred to us by the State agency if the State agency asks us to do so and we agree. The State agency will make written arrangements with us which will specify the period of time and the class or classes of cases we will do.
