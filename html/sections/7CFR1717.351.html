                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RUS makes and guarantees loans to borrowers to bring electric  service to persons in rural areas. To accomplish this objective, RUS  normally requires, as a condition to making or guaranteeing any loans to  an electric borrower, that the borrower execute   and deliver the RUS documents in the form prescribed by RUS. The RUS  mortgage secures repayment of the loans made or guaranteed by RUS and  other loans which, pursuant to the RE Act, RUS has permitted to be  secured pursuant to the RUS mortgage. The Administrator relies upon the  RUS mortgage together with other RUS documents to find and certify, as  required by section 4 of the RE Act (7 U.S.C. 904), that the security  for the loan is reasonably adequate and the loan will be repaid within  the time agreed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS requires borrowers to take such actions as may be necessary  to establish rates for electric service which are sufficient to pay the  principal of and interest on the loans made or guaranteed by RUS in a  timely manner and to meet the requirements of the RUS documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to borrowers whose rates are not regulated by a  State Regulatory Authority, RUS requires that such borrowers establish  rates and to obtain RUS approval of such rates as required by the RUS  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To protect Federal interests, including without limitation the  ability of the borrower to repay RUS loans, RUS's policy is to exercise,  pursuant to the RUS documents, exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for  electric service charged by a borrower by or against whom a case under  the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, has commenced.</p>
