                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less (including MDPVs) must be equipped with an onboard diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring all emission-related powertrain systems or components during the applicable useful life of the vehicle. All systems and components required to be monitored by these regulations must be evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than once per applicable certification test cycle as defined in paragraphs (a) and (d) of Appendix I of this part, or similar trip as approved by the Administrator. Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O are not required to be monitored by the OBD system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less (including MDPVs) must be equipped with an onboard diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring all emission-related powertrain systems or components during the applicable useful life of the vehicle. All systems and components required to be monitored by these regulations must be evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than once per applicable certification test cycle as defined in paragraphs (a) and (d) of Appendix I of this part, or similar trip as approved by the Administrator. Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O are not required to be monitored by the OBD system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Diesel fueled MDPVs and heavy-duty vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less that are not MDPVs must meet the OBD requirements of this section according to the phase-in schedule in paragraph (l) of this section. Paragraph (l) of this section does not apply to Otto-cycle MDPVs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An OBD system demonstrated to fully meet the requirements in, through model year 2006, Sec. 86.004-17 and, for model years 2007 and later, Sec. 86.007-17 may be used to meet the requirements of this section, provided that such an OBD system also incorporates appropriate transmission diagnostics as may be required under this section, and provided that the Administrator finds that a manufacturer's decision to use the flexibility in this paragraph (a)(3) is based on good engineering judgement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Malfunction descriptions. The OBD system must detect and identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain systems or components according to the following malfunction definitions as measured and calculated in accordance with test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part (chassis-based test procedures), excluding those test procedures defined as ``Supplemental'' test procedures in Sec. 86.004-2 and codified in Secs. 86.158, 86.159, and 86.160. For clean alternative fuel conversion manufacturers, your OBD system is expected to detect and identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain systems or components according to the malfunction definitions described in this paragraph (b) as measured and calculated in accordance with the chassis-based test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part to the extent feasible, excluding the elements of the Supplemental FTP (see Sec. 86.1803). However, at a minimum, systems must detect and identify malfunctions as described in paragraph (k)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Catalysts and particulate traps--(i) Otto-cycle. Catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in an increase in NMHC emissions 1.5 times the NMHC standard or FEL, as compared to the NMHC emission level measured using a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Otto-cycle. Catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in an increase in NMHC emissions 1.5 times the NMHC standard or FEL, as compared to the NMHC emission level measured using a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Diesel. (A) If equipped, catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NOX or PM. This requirement applies only to reduction catalysts; monitoring of oxidation catalysts is not required. This monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration or malfunction of the system will not result in exceedance of the threshold.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If equipped, catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NOX or PM. This requirement applies only to reduction catalysts; monitoring of oxidation catalysts is not required. This monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration or malfunction of the system will not result in exceedance of the threshold.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If equipped with a particulate trap, catastrophic failure of the device must be detected. Any particulate trap whose complete failure results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NOX or PM must be monitored for such catastrophic failure. This monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer can demonstrate that a catastrophic failure of the system will not result in exceedance of the threshold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engine misfire--(i) Otto-cycle. Engine misfire resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NMHC, CO or NOX;

and any misfire capable of damaging the catalytic converter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Otto-cycle. Engine misfire resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NMHC, CO or NOX;

and any misfire capable of damaging the catalytic converter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Diesel. Lack of cylinder combustion must be detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Oxygen sensors. If equipped, oxygen sensor deterioration or malfunction resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for NMHC, CO or NOX.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Evaporative leaks. If equipped, any vapor leak in the evaporative and/or refueling system (excluding the tubing and connections between the purge valve and the intake manifold) greater than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch diameter orifice; an absence of evaporative purge air flow from the complete evaporative emission control system. On vehicles with fuel tank capacity greater than 25 gallons, the Administrator may, following a request from the manufacturer, revise the size of the orifice to the smallest orifice feasible, based on test data, if the most reliable monitoring method available cannot reliably detect a system leak equal to a 0.040 inch diameter orifice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other emission control systems. Any deterioration or malfunction occurring in a powertrain system or component directly intended to control emissions, including but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the secondary air system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable emission standard or FEL for NMHC, CO, NOX, or diesel PM. For vehicles equipped with a secondary air system, a functional check, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration of the flow distribution system is unlikely. This demonstration is subject to Administrator approval and, if the demonstration and associated functional check are approved, the diagnostic system must indicate a malfunction when some degree of secondary airflow is not detectable in the exhaust system during the check. For vehicles equipped with positive crankcase ventilation (PCV), monitoring of the PCV system is not necessary provided the manufacturer can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the PCV system is unlikely to fail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other emission-related powertrain components. Any other deterioration or malfunction occurring in an electronic emission-related powertrain system or component not otherwise described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section that either provides input to or receives commands from the on-board computer and has a measurable impact on emissions; monitoring of components required by this paragraph (b)(6) must be satisfied by employing electrical circuit continuity checks and rationality checks for computer input components (input values within manufacturer specified ranges based on other available operating parameters), and functionality checks for computer output components (proper functional response to computer commands) except that the Administrator may waive such a rationality or functionality check where the manufacturer has demonstrated infeasibility. Malfunctions are defined as a failure of the system or component to meet the electrical circuit continuity checks or the rationality or functionality checks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Performance of OBD functions. Oxygen sensor or any other component deterioration or malfunction which renders that sensor or component incapable of performing its function as part of the OBD system must be detected and identified on vehicles so equipped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Hybrid electric vehicles. For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) only. Unless added to HEVs in compliance with other requirements of this section, or unless otherwise approved by the Administrator:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a maintenance indicator consisting of a light that must activate automatically by illuminating the first time the minimum performance level is observed for each battery system component. Possible battery system components requiring monitoring are: battery water level, temperature control, pressure control, and other parameters critical for determining battery condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a separate odometer or

other device subject to the approval of the Administrator that can accurately measure the mileage accumulation on the engines used in these vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Malfunction indicator light (MIL). The OBD system must incorporate a malfunction indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the vehicle operator. When illuminated, the MIL must display ``Check Engine,'' ``Service Engine Soon,'' a universally recognizable engine symbol, or a similar phrase or symbol approved by the Administrator. A vehicle should not be equipped with more than one general purpose malfunction indicator light for emission-related problems; separate specific purpose warning lights (e.g. brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. The use of red for the OBD-related malfunction indicator light is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> MIL illumination. (1) The MIL must illuminate and remain illuminated when any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section are detected and verified, or whenever the engine control enters a default or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for the given engine operating conditions. The MIL must blink once per second under any period of operation during which engine misfire is occurring and catalyst damage is imminent. If such misfire is detected again during the following driving cycle (i.e., operation consisting of, at a minimum, engine start-up and engine shut-off) or the next driving cycle in which similar conditions are encountered, the MIL must maintain a steady illumination when the misfire is not occurring and then remain illuminated until the MIL extinguishing criteria of this section are satisfied. The MIL must also illuminate when the vehicle's ignition is in the ``key-on'' position before engine starting or cranking and extinguish after engine starting if no malfunction has previously been detected. If a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has previously been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which similar conditions are encountered and no new malfunctions have been detected. Similar conditions are defined as engine speed within 375 rpm, engine load within 20 percent, and engine warm-up status equivalent to that under which the malfunction was first detected. If any malfunction other than a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which the monitoring system responsible for illuminating the MIL functions without detecting the malfunction, and no new malfunctions have been detected. Upon Administrator approval, statistical MIL illumination protocols may be employed, provided they result in comparable timeliness in detecting a malfunction and evaluating system performance, i.e., three to six driving cycles would be considered acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The MIL must illuminate and remain illuminated when any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section are detected and verified, or whenever the engine control enters a default or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for the given engine operating conditions.

After the 2007 model year, this provision can be used only for interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs introduced into commerce in American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, but this provision only can be used for such vehicles in any of those locations if low sulfur gasoline is determined by the Administrator to be unavailable in that specific location.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs produced through the 2007 model year, upon a manufacturer's written request, EPA will consider allowing the use of an on-board diagnostic system during the certification process that functions properly on low-sulfur gasoline but indicates sulfur-induced passes when exposed to high sulfur gasoline.

Mariana Islands, but this provision only can be used for such vehicles in any of those locations if low sulfur gasoline is determined by the Administrator to be unavailable in that specific location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Storing of computer codes. The OBD system shall record and store in computer memory diagnostic trouble codes and diagnostic readiness codes indicating the status of the emission control system. These codes shall be available through the standardized data link connector per specifications as referenced in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A diagnostic trouble code must be stored for any detected and verified malfunction causing MIL illumination. The stored diagnostic trouble code must identify the malfunctioning system or component as uniquely as possible. At the manufacturer's discretion, a diagnostic trouble code may be stored for conditions not causing MIL illumination. Regardless, a separate code should be stored indicating the expected MIL illumination status (i.e., MIL commanded ``ON,'' MIL commanded ``OFF'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a single misfiring cylinder, the diagnostic trouble code(s) must uniquely identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits data and/or engineering evaluations which adequately demonstrate that the misfiring cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain operating conditions. For diesel vehicles only, the specific cylinder for which combustion cannot be detected need not be identified if new hardware would be required to do so. The diagnostic trouble code must identify multiple misfiring cylinder conditions; under multiple misfire conditions, the misfiring cylinders need not be uniquely identified if a distinct multiple misfire diagnostic trouble code is stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The diagnostic system may erase a diagnostic trouble code if the same code is not re-registered in at least 40 engine warm-up cycles, and the malfunction indicator light is not illuminated for that code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Separate status codes, or readiness codes, must be stored in computer memory to identify correctly functioning emission control systems and those emission control systems which require further vehicle operation to complete proper diagnostic evaluation. A readiness code need not be stored for those monitors that can be considered continuously operating monitors (e.g., misfire monitor, fuel system monitor, etc.). Readiness codes should never be set to ``not ready'' status upon key-on or key-off; intentional setting of readiness codes to ``not ready'' status via service procedures must apply to all such codes, rather than applying to individual codes. Subject to Administrator approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number of driving cycles (i.e., more than one) due to the continued presence of extreme operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures below 40 F, or altitudes above 8000 feet), readiness for the subject monitoring system may be set to ``ready'' status without monitoring having been completed. Administrator approval shall be based on the conditions for monitoring system disablement, and the number of driving cycles specified without completion of monitoring before readiness is indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Available diagnostic data. (1) Upon determination of the first malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine conditions present at the time must be stored in computer memory. Should a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any previously stored freeze frame conditions must be replaced by the fuel system or misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine conditions must include, but are not limited to: engine speed, open or closed loop operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, calculated load value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and intake manifold pressure if the information needed to determine these conditions is available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the manufacturer must include the most appropriate set of conditions to facilitate effective repairs. If the diagnostic trouble code causing the conditions to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the stored engine conditions may also be erased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon determination of the first malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine conditions present at the time must be stored in computer memory.

If the diagnostic trouble code causing the conditions to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the stored engine conditions may also be erased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following data in addition to the required freeze frame information

must be made available on demand through the serial port on the standardized data link connector, if the information is available to the on-board computer or can be determined using information available to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble codes, engine coolant temperature, fuel control system status (closed loop, open loop, other), fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air temperature, manifold air pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle position sensor output value, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere), calculated load value, vehicle speed, and fuel pressure. The signals must be provided in standard units based on SAE specifications incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section. Actual signals must be clearly identified separately from default value or limp home signals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all OBD systems for which specific on-board evaluation tests are conducted (catalyst, oxygen sensor, etc.), the results of the most recent test performed by the vehicle, and the limits to which the system is compared must be available through the standardized data link connector per the appropriate standardized specifications as referenced in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Access to the data required to be made available under this section shall be unrestricted and shall not require any access codes or devices that are only available from the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exceptions. The OBD system is not required to evaluate systems or components during malfunction conditions if such evaluation would result in a risk to safety or failure of systems or components. Additionally, the OBD system is not required to evaluate systems or components during operation of a power take-off unit such as a dump bed, snow plow blade, or aerial bucket, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Incorporation by reference. The following additional requirements apply based on industry standard specifications, which are incorporated by reference in Sec. 86.1:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following requirements apply for standardized on-board to off-board communications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Starting in model year 2008, light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks must comply with ISO 15765-4:2005(E), ``Road Vehicles-Diagnostics on Controller Area Network (CAN)--Part 4: Requirements for emission-related systems'', January 15, 2005.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Starting in model year 2008, heavy-duty vehicles must comply with the protocol described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, or the following set of SAE standards: SAE J1939-11, Revised October 1999; SAE J1939-13, July 1999; SAE J1939-21, Revised April 2001; SAE J1939-31, Revised December 1997; SAE J1939-71, Revised January 2008; SAE J1939-73, Revised September 2006; SAE J1939-81, May 2003.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Note that for model years 1996 through 2007 manufacturers could instead comply with the protocols specified in SAE J1850, ISO 9141-2, or ISO 14230-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks must meet the following additional specifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Basic diagnostic data (as specified in Secs. 86.094-17(e) and (f)) shall be provided in the format and units in SAE J1979 ``E/E Diagnostic Test Modes--Equivalent to ISO/DIS 15031-5: Revised, May 2007.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Diagnostic trouble codes shall be consistent with SAE J2012 ``Diagnostic Trouble Code Definitions--Equivalent to ISO/DIS 15031-6: April 30, 2002'', (Revised, April 2002).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The connection interface between the OBD system and test equipment and diagnostic tools shall meet the functional requirements of SAE J1962 ``Diagnostic Connector--Equivalent to ISO/DIS 15031-3: December 14, 2001'' (Revised, April 2002).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> SAE J1930, Revised April 2002.

Upon application by the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will be granted only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as, but not limited to: Technical feasibility of the given monitor and lead time and production cycles including phase-in or phase-out of vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of computers. Unmet requirements should not be carried over from the previous model year except where unreasonable hardware or software modifications would be necessary to correct the deficiency, and the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward compliance as determined by the Administrator. Furthermore, EPA will not accept any deficiency requests that include the complete lack of a major diagnostic monitor (``major'' diagnostic monitors being those for exhaust aftertreatment devices, oxygen sensor, air-fuel ratio sensor, NOX sensor, engine misfire, evaporative leaks, and diesel EGR, if equipped), with the possible exception of the special provisions for alternative fueled engines. For alternative fueled vehicles (e.g., natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol), manufacturers may request the Administrator to waive specific monitoring requirements of this section for which monitoring may not be reliable with respect to the use of the alternative fuel. At a minimum, alternative fuel engines must be equipped with an OBD system meeting OBD requirements to the extent feasible as approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> California OBDII compliance option.
