                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria. Each book of the Code shall be updated at least once each calendar year. If no change in its contents has occurred during the year, a simple notation to that effect may serve as the supplement for that year. More frequent updating of any unit of the Code may be made whenever the Director of the Federal Register determines that the content of the unit has been substantially superseded or otherwise determines that such action would be consistent with the intent and purpose of the Administrative Committee as stated in Sec. 8.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Staggered publication. The Code will be produced over a 12-month period under a staggered publication system to be determined by the Director of the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cutoff dates. Each updated title of the Code will reflect each amendment to that title published as a codified regulation in the Federal Register on or before the ``As of'' date. Thus, each title updated as of July 1 each year will reflect all amendatory documents appearing in the daily Federal Register on or before July 1.
