                            <p class="depth0">Subpart A of this part does not apply to temporary employment in the Territory of Guam, except that an employer seeking certification for a job opportunity on Guam must obtain a prevailing wage from the Department in accordance with Sec. 655.10 of this subpart. The U.S. Department of Labor (Department or DOL) does not certify to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of DHS the temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-2B visas, or enforce compliance with the provisions of the H-2B visa program, in the Territory of Guam. Under DHS regulations, administration of the H-2B temporary labor certification program is undertaken by the Governor of Guam, or the Governor's designated representative.
