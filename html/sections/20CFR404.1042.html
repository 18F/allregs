                                Sec. 404.1042  Wages when paid and received.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Wages are received by an employee at the time they  are paid by the employer to the employee. Wages are paid by an employer  at the time that they are actually or constructively paid unless they  are deemed to be paid later (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Constructive payment. Wages are constructively paid when they  are credited to the account of, or set aside for, an employee so that  they may be drawn upon by the employee at any time although not then  actually received. To be a payment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The wages must be credited to or set aside for the employee and  must be made available without restriction so that they may be drawn  upon at any time; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer must intend to pay or to set aside or credit, and  have the ability to pay wages when due to the employee, and failure of  the employer to credit or set aside the wages is due to clerical error  or mistake in the mechanics of payment, and because of the clerical  error or mistake the wages are not actually available at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deemed payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first $100 of cash paid, either actually  or constructively, by an employer to an employee in a calendar year is  considered paid at the time that the amount of the cash payment totals  $100 for the year in the case of pay for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Work not in the course of the employer's trade or business (non- business work);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Work by certain home workers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Work for an organization exempt from income tax under section  501 of the Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We also apply this rule to domestic work in a private home of  the employer, except see Sec. 404.1057(a)(1) for the applicable dollar  amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cash of less than $150 that an employer pays to an employee in a  calendar year, either actually or constructively, for agricultural labor  is considered paid at the earliest of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time in the calendar year that the employee's pay totals  $150; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The 20th day of the calendar year on which the employee works  for cash pay computed on a time basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an employer pays cash to an employee for two or more of the  kinds of work referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, we apply  the provisions of this paragraph to the pay for each kind of work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee tax deductions. We consider employee tax deductions  under section 3101 of the Code to be part of the employee's wages and  consider them to be paid at the time of the deduction. We consider other  deductions from wages to be wages paid at the time of the deduction. It  is immaterial that the deductions are required or permitted by an act of  Congress or the law of any State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tips. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tips received by an employee in the course of  employment, that are considered to be wages, are deemed to be paid at  the time the employee reports the tips to the employer in a written  statement as provided under section 6053(a) of the Code. Tips that are  not reported are deemed to be paid to the employee at the time they are  received by the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We consider tips to be received in the course of employment  whether they are received by the employee from the employer or from  another person. Only tips employees receive and keep for themselves are  considered to be the employees' pay. If employees split tips, each  employee who receives part of the tip receives tips in the course of  employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payments under nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Amounts  that an employee is entitled to receive under nonqualified deferred  compensation plans (plans that do not qualify for special tax treatment  under the Code) are creditable as wages for Social Security purposes at  the later of the following times:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the services are performed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture (as  defined in section 83 of the Code) of the employee's rights to the  deferred compensation.  Any amounts taken into account as wages by this paragraph (and the  income attributable thereto) will not thereafter be treated as wages for  Social Security purposes.
