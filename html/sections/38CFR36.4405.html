                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditional approval. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary may provide written  notification to an eligible individual of conditional approval of a  specially adapted housing grant if the Secretary has determined that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disability requirements have been satisfied pursuant to Sec.  36.4404(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Feasibility and suitability requirements have been satisfied  pursuant to Sec. 36.4404(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The eligible individual has not exceeded the usage or dollar  limitations prescribed by Sec. Sec. 36.4402(d) and 36.4403.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Once conditional approval has been granted, the Secretary may  authorize, in writing, an eligible individual to incur certain  preconstruction costs pursuant to Sec. 36.4406.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final approval. In order for an individual to obtain final  approval for a specially adapted housing grant, the Secretary must  determine that the following property requirements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposed adaptations. The plans and specifications of the  proposed adaptations demonstrate compliance with minimum property and  design requirements of the specially adapted housing program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of 2101(a) grants, the eligible  individual must have, or provide satisfactory evidence that he or she  will acquire, an ownership interest in the housing unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of 2101(b) grants, the eligible individual or a  member of the eligible individual's family must have, or provide  satisfactory evidence that he or she will acquire, an ownership interest  in the housing unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of TRA grants:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A member of the eligible individual's family must have, or  provide satisfactory evidence that he or she will acquire, an ownership  interest in the housing unit, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The eligible individual and the member of the eligible  individual's family who has or acquires an ownership interest in the  housing unit must sign a certification as to the likelihood of the  eligible individual's temporary occupancy of such residence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the ownership interest in the housing unit is or will be  vested in the eligible individual and another person, the Secretary will  not for that reason reduce by percentage of ownership the amount of a  specially adapted housing grant. However, to meet the ownership  requirement for final approval of a specially adapted housing grant, the  eligible individual's ownership interest must be of sufficient quantum  and quality, as determined by the Secretary, to ensure the eligible  individual's quiet enjoyment of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certifications. The eligible individual must certify, in such  form as the Secretary will prescribe, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Neither the eligible individual, nor anyone authorized to act  for the eligible individual, will refuse to sell or rent, after  receiving a bona fide offer, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or  rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the housing unit  acquired by this benefit, to any person because of race, color,  religion, sex, familial status, disability, or national origin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The eligible individual, and anyone authorized to act for the  eligible individual, recognizes that any restrictive covenant on the  housing unit relating to race, color, religion, sex, familial status,  disability, or national origin is illegal and void, and any such  covenant is specifically disclaimed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The eligible individual, and anyone authorized to act for the  eligible individual, understands that civil action for preventative  relief may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States in  any appropriate U.S. District Court against any person responsible for a  violation of the applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Flood insurance. The eligible individual's housing unit, if it  is or becomes located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood  insurance has been   made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended, must  be covered by flood insurance. The amount of flood insurance must be at  least equal to the lesser of the full insurable value of the housing  unit or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type  of housing unit under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The  Secretary will not approve any financial assistance for the acquisition  or construction of a housing unit located in an area identified by the  Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards  unless the community in which such area is situated is then  participating in the National Flood Insurance Program  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, chapter 21, 42 U.S.C. 4012a, 4106(a))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Geographical limits. Any real property purchased, constructed,  or adapted with the proceeds of a specially adapted housing grant must  be located:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within the United States, which, for purposes of 38 U.S.C.  chapter 21, includes the several States, Territories, and possessions,  including the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico  and the Northern Mariana Islands; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If outside the United States, in a country or political  subdivision which allows individuals to have or acquire a beneficial  property interest, and in which the Secretary, in his or her discretion,  has determined that it is reasonably practicable for the Secretary to  provide assistance in acquiring specially adapted housing.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2101, 2101A, 2102A)   (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection provisions in this section under control numbers 2900-0031,  2900-0132, and 2900-0300)</p>
