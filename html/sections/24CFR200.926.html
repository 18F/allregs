Sec. 200.926a-200.926e, apply to single family detached homes, duplexes, three-unit homes, and to living units in a structure where the units are located side-by-side in town house fashion. Section 200.926d(c)(4) also applies to four-unit homes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable structures. The standards identified or contained in this section, and in Sec. Sec. 200.926a-200.926e, apply to single family detached homes, duplexes, three-unit homes, and to living units in a structure where the units are located side-by-side in town house fashion. Section 200.926d(c)(4) also applies to four-unit homes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of standards to new construction. The standards referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable to structures which are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approved for insurance or other benefits prior to the start of construction, including approval under the Direct Endorsement process described in Sec. 203.5 of this chapter, or under the Lender Insurance process described in Sec. 203.6 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approved for insurance or other benefits based upon participation in an insured warranty program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Insured as new construction based upon a Certificate of Reasonable Value issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conflicting standards. The requirements contained in Sec. 200.926d do not preempt local or State standards, nor do they alter or affect a builder's obligation to comply with any local or State requirements. However, a property shall be eligible for benefits only if it complies with the requirements of this subpart, including any referenced standards. When any of the requirements identified in Sec. 200.926c are in conflict with a partially accepted local or state code, the conflict will be resolved by the HUD Field Office servicing the jurisdiction in which the property is to be located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Standard for evaluating local or state building codes. The Secretary shall compare a local building code submitted under paragraph (d) of this section or a State code to the list of construction related areas contained in Sec. 200.926a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A local or State code will be accepted if it regulates each area and subarea on the list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State or local building code will be partially accepted if it regulates most of the areas on the list. However, no code may be partially accepted if it fails to regulate the subarea for seismic design (see Sec. 200.926a(c)(5)), or if it fails to regulate subareas in more than one of the following major areas listed in Sec. 200.926a: fire safety, light and ventilation, structural loads and seismic design, foundation systems, materials standards, construction components, glass, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, a local or State code regulates an area or subarea if it establishes a standard concerning that area or subarea. However, for earthquake loads (see Sec. 200.926a(c)(5)), ASCE 7-88 is mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Code selection.
