If, after reviewing the recommendations and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines suspension is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c) and notify the HCA of the action taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fact-finding proceedings.
