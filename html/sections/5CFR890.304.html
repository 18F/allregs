Program, unless the employee or annuitant provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child or children.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An annuitant or survivor annuitant may suspend enrollment in FEHB for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare-sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including coverage provided by the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life instead of FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB coverage, documentation of eligibility for coverage under the non-FEHB program must be submitted to the retirement system.

Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the retirement system receives the documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The enrollee and covered family members are not entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to an individual contract for health benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Temporary continuation of coverage.
