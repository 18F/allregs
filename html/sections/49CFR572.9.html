                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis consist of the assemblies  designated as numbers SA 150 M050 and SA 150 M060 in Figure 1 and  conform to the drawings subtended by these numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall flex by  an amount that permits the rigid thoracic spine to rotate from its  initial position in accordance with Figure 11 by the number of degrees  shown below at each specified force level, and straighten upon removal  of the force to within 12 degrees of its initial position in accordance  with Figure 11.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Force (6</p><p class="depth0">pounds) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 0....................................................               0 20...................................................              28 30...................................................              40 40...................................................              52 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Test procedure: (1) Assemble the thorax, lumbar spine, pelvic,  and upper leg assemblies (above the femur force transducers), ensuring  that all component surfaces are clean, dry, and untreated unless  otherwise specified, and attach them to the horizontal fixture   shown in Figure 5 at the two link rod pins and with the mounting  brackets for the lumbar test fixtures illustrated in Figures 6 to 9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Attach the rear mounting of the pelvis to the pelvic instrument  cavity rear face at the four \1/4\ cap screw holes and attach  the front mounting at the femur axial rotation joint. Tighten the  mountings so that the pelvic-lumbar adapter is horizontal and adjust the  femur friction plungers at each hip socket joint to 240 inch-pounds  torque.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flex the thorax forward 50[deg] and then rearward as necessary  to return it to its initial position in accordance with Figure 11  unsupported by external means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Apply a forward force perpendicular to the thorax instrument  cavity rear face in the midsagittal plane 15 inches above the top  surface of the pelvic-lumbar adapter. Apply the force at any torso  deflection rate between .5 and 1.5 degrees per second up to 40[deg] of  flexion but no further, continue to apply for 10 seconds that force  necessary to maintain 40[deg] of flexion, and record the force with an  instrument mounted to the thorax as shown in Figure 5. Release all force  as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle 3 minutes after the  release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When the abdomen is subjected to continuously applied force in  accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the abdominal force- deflection curve shall be within the two curves plotted in Figure 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test procedure: (1) Place the assembled thorax, lumbar spine and  pelvic assemblies in a supine position on a flat, rigid, smooth, dry,  clean horizontal surface, ensuring that all component surfaces are  clean, dry, and untreated unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Place a rigid cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 18 inches long  transversely across the abdomen, so that the cylinder is symmetrical  about the midsagittal plane, with its longitudinal centerline horizontal  and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane at a point 9.2 inches above  the bottom line of the buttocks, measured with the dummy positioned in  accordance with Figure 11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Establish the zero deflection point as the point at which a  force of 10 pounds has been reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Apply a vertical downward force through the cylinder at any rate  between 0.25 and 0.35 inches per second.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Guide the cylinder so that it moves without significant lateral  or rotational movement.
