If a waiver of compliance has been granted under Sec. 61.11, the deadline for conducting the initial compliance test shall be incorporated into the terms of the waiver. The benzene removal efficiency rate for each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator shall be calculated as in the following equation:

For the purpose of the application of Method 21 to this section, the words ``leak definition'' shall be the maximum concentration point, which would be estimated until it is established under Sec. 61.139(h). The calibration gas shall either be benzene or methane and shall be at a concentration associated with 125 percent of the expected organic compound concentration level for the carbon adsorber outlet vent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall monitor either the concentration of benzene or the concentration level of organic compounds at the outlet vent of the adsorber. The monitoring device shall be calibrated, operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurements of benzene concentration shall be made according to Sec. 61.139(g)(2).

The probe shall be held there for at least 5 minutes during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected to occur. The maximum reading during that period shall be used as the measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring shall be performed at least once within the first 7 days after replacement of the carbon bed occurs, and monthly thereafter until 10 days before the scheduled replacement time, at which point monitoring shall be done daily, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the monthly monitoring or on the first day of daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed on the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected, or 10 days before the exceedance was detected, whichever is longer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except on the first day, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed 10 days before the exceedance was detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or operator is monitoring on the schedule required in paragraph (e)(4) or paragraph (e)(5) of this section, and the scheduled replacement time is reached without exceeding the maximum concentration point, the owner or operator may return to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for subsequent carbon beds.</p><p class="depth3">Note: This note provides an example of the monitoring schedules in paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section. Assume that the scheduled replacement time for a non-regenerative carbon adsorber is the 105th day after installation. According to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, initial monitoring would be done within 7 days after installation, monthly monitoring would be done on the 30th, 60th and 90th days, and daily monitoring would begin on the 95th day after installation. Now assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 90th day after installation. On the replacement carbon bed, the owner or operator would begin daily monitoring on the 61st day after installation (i.e., the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected), according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If, instead, the exceedance were detected on the first bed on the 95th day, the daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 85th day after installation (i.e., 10 days before the point in the cycle where the exceedance was detected); this is a second example of the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Finally, assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 100th day after the first carbon adsorber was installed. According to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 90th day after installation (i.e., 10 days earlier than when the exceedance was detected on the previous bed). In all of these examples, the initial monitoring of the replacement bed within 7 days of installation and the monthly monitoring would proceed as set out in paragraph (e)(3) of this section until daily monitoring was required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements specified below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of [1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or [0.5 C, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where a vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply with paragraph (f)(2)(i), paragraph (f)(2)(ii), or paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each source. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each source at a point closest to the inlet of each vapor incinerator and before being joined with any other vent stream.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow away from the vapor incinerator at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed in each bypass line, immediately downstream of the valve that, if opened, would divert the vent stream away from the vapor incinerator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where a valve that opens a bypass line is secured in the closed position with a car seal or a lock-and-key configuration, a flow indicator is not required. The owner or operator shall perform a visual inspection at least once every month to check the position of the valve and the condition of the car seal or lock-and-key configuration. The owner or operator shall also record the date and duration of each time that the valve was opened and the vent stream diverted away from the vapor incinerator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In conducting the compliance tests required in Sec. 61.139(c), and measurements specified in Sec. 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the owner or operator shall use as reference methods the test methods and procedures in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or other methods as specified in this paragraph, except as specified in Sec. 61.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For compliance tests, as described in Sec. 61.139(c)(1), the following provisions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All tests shall be run under representative emission concentration and vent flow rate conditions. For sources with intermittent flow rates, representative conditions shall include typical emission surges (for example, during the loading of a storage tank).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each test shall consist of three separate runs. These runs will be averaged to yield the volumetric flow rates and benzene concentrations in the equation in Sec. 61.139(c)(1). Each run shall be a minimum of 1 hour.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For each regenerative carbon adsorber, each run shall take place in one adsorption cycle, to include a minimum of 1 hour of sampling immediately preceding the initiation of carbon bed regeneration.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, all runs can occur during one adsorption cycle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The measurements during the runs shall be paired so that the inlet and outlet to the control device are measured simultaneously.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method 1 or 1A shall be used as applicable for locating measurement sites.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method 2, 2A, or 2D shall be used as applicable for measuring vent flow rates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Method 18 shall be used for determining the benzene concentrations (Caj and Cbi). Either the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure or the direct interface procedure may be used. A separation column constructed of stainless steel, 1.83 m by 3.2 mm, containing 10 percent 1,2,3-tris (2-cyanoethoxy) propane (TECP) on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb P AW, with a column temperature of 80 C, a detector temperature of 225 C, and a flow rate of approximately 20 ml/min, may produce adequate separations. The analyst can use other columns, provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of benzene standards is not impaired. The analyst shall have available for review information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the benzene peak.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure is used, the sample rate shall be adjusted to maintain a constant proportion to vent flow rate.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure is used, then each performance test run shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval ``t,'' readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the flow rate (Qaj or Qbi) and the corresponding benzene concentration (Caj

or Cbi) shall be determined. The sampling system shall be constructed to include a mixing chamber of a volume equal to 5 times the sampling flow rate per minute. Each analysis performed by the chromatograph will then represent an averaged emission value for a 5-minute time period. The vent flow rate readings shall be timed to account for the total sample system residence time. A dual column, dual detector chromatograph can be used to achieve an analysis interval of 5 minutes. The individual benzene concentrations shall be vent flow rate weighted to determine sample run average concentrations. The individual vent flow rates shall be time averaged to determine sample run average flow rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For testing the benzene concentration at the outlet vent of the carbon adsorber as specified under Secs. 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the following provisions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The measurement shall be conducted over one 5-minute period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements in Sec. 61.139(g)(1)(i) shall apply to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The requirements in Sec. 61.139(g)(1)(vi) shall apply.
