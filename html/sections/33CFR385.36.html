The guidance  memorandum shall also describe the process for comparing the recommended  project with the pre-CERP baseline to determine if existing legal  sources of water are to be transferred or eliminated as a result of  project implementation. The guidance memorandum shall include a  definition for existing legal sources of water for the purposes of  determining if existing legal sources of water are to be eliminated or  transferred. Existing legal sources of water shall include those for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An agricultural or urban water supply;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation or entitlement to the Seminole Indian Tribe of  Florida under section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement  Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Water supply for Everglades National Park; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Water supply for fish and wildlife.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Until guidance is issued, issues involving existing legal  sources of water should be resolved on a case-by-case basis considering  all factors that can be identified as relevant to decisions under the  savings clause.</p>
