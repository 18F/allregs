                            <p class="depth0">We may approve a permanent exemption from the restrictions on imports under Sec.  1068.301(b) under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> National security exemption. You may import an engine or piece of equipment under the national security exemption in Sec.  1068.225, but only if it is properly labeled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturer-owned engine/equipment exemption. You may import manufacturer-owned engines/equipment, as described in Sec.  1068.215.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Replacement engine exemption. You may import a nonconforming replacement engine as described in Sec.  1068.240. To use this exemption, you must be a certificate holder for a family we regulate under the same part as the replacement engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extraordinary circumstances exemption. You may import a nonconforming engine or piece of equipment if we grant hardship relief as described in Sec.  1068.245.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Small-volume manufacturer exemption. You may import a nonconforming engine or piece of equipment if we grant hardship relief for a small-volume manufacturer, as described in Sec.  1068.250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Equipment-manufacturer hardship exemption. You may import a nonconforming engine if we grant an exemption for the transition to new or revised emission standards, as described in Sec.  1068.255.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Identical configuration exemption. Unless specified otherwise in the standard-setting part, you may import nonconforming engines/equipment if they are identical to certified engines/equipment produced by the same manufacturer, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must meet all the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You have owned the engines/equipment for at least six months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You agree not to sell, lease, donate, trade, or otherwise transfer ownership of the engines/equipment for at least five years. During this period, the only acceptable way to dispose of the engines/equipment is to destroy or export them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You use data or evidence sufficient to show that the engines/equipment are in a configuration that is identical to engines/equipment the original manufacturer has certified to meet emission standards that apply at the time the manufacturer finished assembling or modifying the engines/equipment in question. If you modify the engines/equipment to make them identical, you must completely follow the original manufacturer's written instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will tell you in writing if we find the information insufficient to show that the engines/equipment are eligible for this exemption. In this case, we will not consider your request further until you address our concerns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ancient engine/equipment exemption. If you are not the original engine/equipment manufacturer, you may import nonconforming engines/equipment that are subject to a standard-setting part and were first manufactured at least 21 years earlier, as long as they are still in their original configurations.</p>
