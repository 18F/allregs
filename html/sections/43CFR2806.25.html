                                Sec. 2806.25  How may I make rental payments when land encumbered by 
2807.15(b)) is being transferred out of Federal ownership?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> One-time payment option for existing perpetual grants. If you have a perpetual grant and the land your grant encumbers is being transferred out of Federal ownership, you may choose to make a one-time rental payment. The BLM will determine the one-time payment for a perpetual grant by dividing the current annual rent for the subject property by an overall capitalization rate calculated from market data, where the overall capitalization rate is the difference between a market yield rate and a percent annual rent increase as described in the formula in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. The formula for this calculation is: One-time Rental Payment = Annual Rent/ (Y-CR), where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual Rent = Current Annual Rent Applicable to the Subject Property from the Per Acre Rent Schedule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Y = Yield Rate from the Per Acre Rent Schedule (5.27 percent); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CR = Annual Percent Change in Rent as Determined by the Most Recent 10-Year Average of the difference in the IPD-GDP Index from January of one year to January of the following year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One-time payment for grants converted to perpetual grants under Sec. 2807.15(b). If the land your grant encumbers is being transferred out of Federal ownership, and you request a

conversion of your grant to a perpetual right-of-way grant, you must make a one-time rental payment in accordance with Sec. 2806.25(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the annual rent is determined from the Per Acre Rent Schedule (see Sec. 2806.20(c)) as updated under Sec. 2806.22. However, the per acre zone value and zone number used in this annual rental determination will be based on the per acre land value from acceptable market information or the appraisal report, if any, for the land transfer action and not the county average per acre land and building value from the NASS Census. You may also submit an appraisal report on your own initiative in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When no acceptable market information is available and no appraisal report has been completed for the land transfer action or when the BLM requests it, you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare an appraisal report using Federal appraisal standards, at your expense, that explains how you estimated the land value per acre, the rate of return, and the encumbrance factor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit the appraisal report for consideration by the BLM State Director with jurisdiction over the lands encumbered by your authorization.
