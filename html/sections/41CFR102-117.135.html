                            <p class="depth0">Several statutes mandate the use of U.S. flag carriers for  international shipments, such as 49 U.S.C. 40118, commonly referred to  as the ``Fly America Act'', and 46 U.S.C. 55305, the Cargo Preference  Act of 1954, as amended. The principal restrictions are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Air cargo: The use of foreign-flag air carriers when funded by  the U.S. Government should be rare. International movement of cargo by  air is subject to the Fly America Act, 49 U.S.C. 40118, which requires  the use of U.S. flag air carrier service for all air cargo movements  funded by the U.S. Government, including cargo shipped by contractors,  grantees, and others at Government expense, except when one of the  following exceptions applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transportation is provided under a bilateral or multilateral  air transportation agreement to which the U.S. Government and the  government of a foreign country are parties, and which the Department of  Transportation has determined meets the requirements of the Fly America  Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information on bilateral or multilateral air transport  agreements impacting U.S. Government procured transportation can be  accessed at http://www.state.gov/e/eb/tra/ata/index.htm; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If determined appropriate, GSA may periodically issue FMR  Bulletins providing further guidance on bilateral or multilateral air  transportation agreements impacting U.S. Government procured  transportation. These bulletins may be accessed at http://www.gsa.gov/ bulletins;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the costs of transportation are reimbursed in full by a  third party, such as a foreign government, an international agency, or  other organization; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of a foreign air carrier is determined to be a matter of  necessity by your agency, on a case-by-case basis, when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No U.S. flag air carrier can provide the specific air  transportation needed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No U.S. flag air carrier can meet the time requirements in  cases of emergency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There is a lack of or inadequate U.S. flag air carrier  aircraft;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> There is an unreasonable risk to safety when using a U.S. flag  carrier aircraft (e.g., terrorist threats). Written approval of the use  of foreign air carrier service based on an unreasonable risk to safety  must be approved by your agency on a case-by-case basis and must be  supported by a travel advisory notice issued by the Federal Aviation  Administration, Department of State, or the Transportation Security  Administration; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> No U.S. flag air carrier can accomplish the agency's mission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ocean cargo: International movement of property by water is  subject to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended, 46 U.S.C.  55305, and the implementing regulations found at 46 CFR Part 381, which  require the use of a U.S. flag carrier for 50% of the tonnage shipped by  each Department or Agency when service is available. The Maritime  Administration (MARAD) monitors agency compliance with these laws. All  Departments or Agencies shipping Government-impelled cargo must comply  with the provisions of 46 CFR 381.3.
