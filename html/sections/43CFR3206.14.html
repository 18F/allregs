                            <p class="depth0">BLM computes acreage holdings as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you own an undivided lease interest, your acreage holdings include the total lease acreage:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you own stock in a corporation or a beneficial interest in an association which holds a geothermal lease, your acreage holdings will include your proportionate part of the corporation's or association's share of the total lease acreage. This paragraph applies only if you own more than 10 percent of the

corporate stock or a beneficial interest in the association; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you own a lease interest, you will be charged with the proportionate share of the total lease acreage based on your share of the lease ownership. You will not be charged twice for the same acreage where you own both record title and operating rights for the lease. For example, if you own 50 percent record title interest in a 640 acre lease and 25 percent operating rights, you are charged with 320 acres.</p>
