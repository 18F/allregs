                                Sec. 720.75  Notice review period.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Length of notice review period. The notice review period specified in section 5(a) of the Act runs for 90 days from the date the Document Control Officer for the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics receives a complete notice, or the date EPA determines the notice is complete under Sec. 720.65(c), unless the Agency extends the period under section 5(c) of TSCA and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Suspension of the running of the notice review period. (1) A submitter may voluntarily suspend the running of the notice review period if the Director or his or her delegate agrees. If the Director does not agree, the review period will continue to run, and EPA will notify the submitter. A submitter may request a suspension at any time during the notice review period. The suspension must be for a specified period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A request for suspension may only be submitted in a manner set forth in this paragraph. The request for suspension also may be made orally, including by telephone, to the submitter's EPA contact for that notice, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Requests for suspension may be submitted electronically to EPA via CDX. Such requests must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See Sec. 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An oral request for suspension may be granted by EPA for a maximum of 15 days only. Requests for a longer suspension must only be submitted in the manner set forth in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the submitter has not made a previous oral request, the running of the notice review period is suspended as of the date of receipt of the written paper request, electronic request on optical disc, or CDX submission by EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Extension of notice review period. (1) At any time during the notice review period, EPA may determine that good cause exists to extend the notice review period specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If EPA makes such a determination, EPA will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notify the submitter that EPA is extending the notice review period for a specified length of time, and state the reasons for the extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Issue a notice for publication in the Federal Register which states that EPA is extending the notice review period and gives the reasons for the extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The initial extension may be for a period of up to 90 days. If the initial extension is for less than 90 days, EPA may make additional extensions. However, the total period of extensions may not exceed 90 days for any notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The following are examples of situations in which EPA may find that good cause exists for extending the notice review period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> EPA has reviewed the notice and determined that there is a significant possibility that the chemical substance will be regulated under section 5(e) or section 5(f) of the Act, but EPA is unable to initiate regulatory action within the initial 90-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> EPA has reviewed the submission and is seeking additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EPA has received significant additional information during the notice review period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The submitter has failed to correct a notice after receiving EPA's request under Sec. 720.65(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notice of expiration of notice review period. EPA will notify the submitter that the notice review period has expired or that EPA has completed its review of the notice. Expiration of the review period does not constitute EPA approval or certification of the new chemical substance, and does not mean that EPA may not take regulatory action against the substance in the future. After expiration of the statutory notice review period, in the absence of regulatory action by EPA under section 5(e), 5(f), or 6(a) of the Act, the submitter may manufacture or import the chemical substance even if the submitter has not received notice of expiration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Withdrawal of a notice by the submitter. (1)(i) A submitter may withdraw a notice during the notice review period by submitting a statement of withdrawal in a manner set forth in

this paragraph. The withdrawal is effective upon receipt by EPA of the CDX submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Submission of withdrawal notices. EPA will accept statements of withdrawal only if submitted in accordance with this paragraph. Statements of withdrawal must be generated, completed, and submitted to EPA (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See Sec. 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a manufacturer or importer which withdrew a notice later resubmits a notice for the same chemical substance, a new notice review period begins.
