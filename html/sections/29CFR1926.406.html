                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Cranes and hoists. This paragraph applies to the installation of  electric equipment and wiring used in connection with cranes, monorail  hoists, hoists, and all runways.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disconnecting means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Runway conductor disconnecting means. A  readily accessible disconnecting means shall   be provided between the runway contact conductors and the power supply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disconnecting means for cranes and monorail hoists. A  disconnecting means, capable of being locked in the open position, shall  be provided in the leads from the runway contact conductors or other  power supply on any crane or monorail hoist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If this additional disconnecting means is not readily accessible  from the crane or monorail hoist operating station, means shall be  provided at the operating station to open the power circuit to all  motors of the crane or monorail hoist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The additional disconnect may be omitted if a monorail hoist or  hand-propelled crane bridge installation meets all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The unit is floor controlled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The unit is within view of the power supply disconnecting means;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No fixed work platform has been provided for servicing the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control. A limit switch or other device shall be provided to  prevent the load block from passing the safe upper limit of travel of  any hoisting mechanism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Clearance. The dimension of the working space in the direction  of access to live parts which may require examination, adjustment,  servicing, or maintenance while alive shall be a minimum of 2 feet 6  inches (762 mm). Where controls are enclosed in cabinets, the door(s)  shall open at least 90 degrees or be removable, or the installation  shall provide equivalent access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Grounding. All exposed metal parts of cranes, monorail hoists,  hoists and accessories including pendant controls shall be metallically  joined together into a continuous electrical conductor so that the  entire crane or hoist will be grounded in accordance with Sec.  1926.404(f). Moving parts, other than removable accessories or  attachments, having metal-to-metal bearing surfaces shall be considered  to be electrically connected to each other through the bearing surfaces  for grounding purposes. The trolley frame and bridge frame shall be  considered as electrically grounded through the bridge and trolley  wheels and its respective tracks unless conditions such as paint or  other insulating materials prevent reliable metal-to-metal contact. In  this case a separate bonding conductor shall be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Elevators, escalators, and moving walks--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disconnecting  means. Elevators, escalators, and moving walks shall have a single means  for disconnecting all ungrounded main power supply conductors for each  unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control panels. If control panels are not located in the same  space as the drive machine, they shall be located in cabinets with doors  or panels capable of being locked closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Electric welders--disconnecting means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Motor-generator, AC  transformer, and DC rectifier arc welders. A disconnecting means shall  be provided in the supply circuit for each motor-generator arc welder,  and for each AC transformer and DC rectifier arc welder which is not  equipped with a disconnect mounted as an integral part of the welder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Resistance welders. A switch or circuit breaker shall be  provided by which each resistance welder and its control equipment can  be isolated from the supply circuit. The ampere rating of this  disconnecting means shall not be less than the supply conductor  ampacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> X-Ray equipment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disconnecting means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. A  disconnecting means shall be provided in the supply circuit. The  disconnecting means shall be operable from a location readily accessible  from the X-ray control. For equipment connected to a 120-volt branch  circuit of 30 amperes or less, a grounding-type attachment plug cap and  receptacle of proper rating may serve as a disconnecting means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> More than one piece of equipment. If more than one piece of  equipment is operated from the same high-voltage circuit, each piece or  each group of equipment as a unit shall be provided with a high-voltage  switch or equivalent disconnecting means. This disconnecting means shall  be constructed, enclosed, or located so as to avoid contact by employees  with its live parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control--Radiographic and fluoroscopic types. Radiographic and  fluoroscopic-type equipment shall be effectively enclosed or shall have  interlocks that deenergize the equipment   automatically to prevent ready access to live current-carrying parts.</p>
