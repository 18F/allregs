To that end, implementation of this  rule with respect to grantees, sub-grantees, loan recipients, prime  contractors, or subcontractors in particular States or locales--notably  those where there is no apparent history of relevant discrimination-- must comply with equal protection standards at that level, apart from  the EPA DBE Rule's constitutional compliance as a national matter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To harmonize EPA's DBE Program objectives with the U.S. Supreme  Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200  (1995);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To help remove barriers to the participation of DBEs in the  award of contracts under EPA financial assistance agreements; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To provide appropriate flexibility to recipients of EPA  financial assistance in establishing and providing contracting  opportunities for DBEs.</p>
