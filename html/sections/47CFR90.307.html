                            <p class="depth0">The tables and figures listed in Sec. 90.309 shall be used to  determine the effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna height of the  proposed land mobile base station and the ERP for the associated control  station (control station antenna height shall not exceed 31 meters (100  feet) above average terrain (AAT)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Base stations operating on the frequencies available for land  mobile use in any urbanized area and having an antenna height (AAT) less  than 152 meters (500 feet) shall afford protection to co-channel and  adjacent channel television stations in accordance with the values set  out in tables A and E of Sec. 90.309, except for channel 15 in New  York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where  protection will be in accordance with the values set forth in tables B  and E in 47 CFR 90.309.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For base stations having antenna heights between 152 and 914  meters (500-3000 feet) above average terrain, the effective radiated  power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values  shown in the power reduction graph in Figure A in Sec. 90.309, except  for channel 15 in New York, NY, and Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in  Detroit, MI, where the effective radiated power must be reduced in  accordance with Figure B in Sec. 90.309. For heights of more than 152  meters (500 feet) above average terrain, the distance to the radio path  horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so  determined equals or exceeds the distance to the Grade B contour of a  co-channel TV station (Grade B contour defined in Sec. 73.683(a) of  this chapter), an authorization will not be granted unless it can be  shown that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the  desired protection at the Grade B contour, or that the effective  radiated power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space  attenuation, the desired protection at the Grade B contour will be  achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mobile units and control stations operating on the frequencies  available for land mobile use in any given urbanized area shall afford  protection to co-channel and adjacent channel television stations in  accordance with the values set forth in table C in Sec. 90.309 and  paragraph (d) of this section except for channel 15 in New York, NY, and  Cleveland, OH, and channel 16 in Detroit, MI, where protection will be  in accordance with the values set forth in table D in Sec. 90.309 and  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The minimum distance between a land mobile base station which  has associated mobile units and a protected adjacent channel television  station is 145 km (90 miles).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The television stations to be protected (co-channel, adjacent  channel, IM, and IF) in any given urbanized area, in accordance with the  provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, are  identified in the Commission's publication ``TV stations to be  considered in the preparation of Applications for Land Mobile Facilities  in the Band 470-512 MHz.'' The publication is available at the offices  of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, DC or upon the  request of interested persons.  [72 FR 35197, June 27, 2007]</p>
