                            <p class="depth0">The recipient may pay for its share of response costs using cash, services, credits or any combination of these, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cash. The recipient may pay for its share of response costs in the form of cash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services. The recipient may provide equipment and services to satisfy its cost share requirements under Cooperative Agreements. The recipient must comply with the requirements regarding in-kind and donated services described in 2 CFR 200.306.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credit--(1) General credit requirements. Credits are limited to State site-specific expenses that EPA determines to be reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket expenditures of non-Federal funds for remedial action, as defined in CERCLA section 101(24), that are consistent with a permanent remedy at the site. Credits are established on a site-specific basis. Only a State may claim credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General credit requirements. Credits are limited to State site-specific expenses that EPA determines to be reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket expenditures of non-Federal funds for remedial action, as defined in CERCLA section 101(24), that are consistent with a permanent remedy at the site. Credits are established on a site-specific basis. Only a State may claim credit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State may claim credit for response activity obligations or expenditures incurred by the State or political subdivision between January 1, 1978, and December 11, 1980.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State may claim credit for remedial action expenditures made by the State after October 17, 1986. If such expenditures occurred after the site was listed on the NPL (Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 300), they will be eligible for a credit only if the State initiated the remedial action after obtaining EPA's written approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State may not claim credit for removal actions taken after December 11, 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Credit submission requirements. Although EPA may require additional documentation, the State must submit the following before EPA will approve the use of the credit:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specific amounts claimed for credit, by site (estimated amounts are unacceptable), based on supporting cost documentation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Units of government (State agency, county, local) that incurred the costs, by site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Description of the specific function performed by each unit of government at each site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Certification (signed by the State's fiscal manager or the financial director for each unit of government) that credit costs have not been previously reimbursed by the Federal Government or any other party, and have not been used for matching purposes under any other Federal program or grant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Documentation, if requested by EPA, to ensure the actions undertaken at the site are cost eligible and consistent with CERCLA, as amended, and the NCP requirements in 40 CFR part 300. This requirement does not apply for costs incurred before December 11, 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of credit. The State must first apply credit at the site at which it was earned. With the approval of EPA, the State may use excess credit earned at one site for its cost share at another site (See CERCLA section 104(c)(5)). Credits must be applied on a site-specific basis, and, therefore, may not be used to meet State cost share requirements for Core Program Cooperative Agreements. EPA will not reimburse excess credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credit verification procedures. Expenditure submissions are subject to verification by audit or other financial review. EPA may conduct a technical review (including inspection) to verify that the claimed remedial action is consistent with CERCLA and the NCP (40 CFR part 300).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Excess cash cost share contributions/overmatch. The recipient may direct EPA to return the excess funds or to use the overmatch at one site to meet the cost share obligation at another site. The recipient may not use contributions in excess of the required cost share at one site to meet the cost share obligation for the Core Program cost share. Overmatch is not ``credit'' pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cost sharing. The recipient must comply with the requirements regarding cost sharing described in 2 CFR 200.306. Finally, the recipient cannot use costs incurred under the Core Program to offset cost share requirements at a site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advance match. (1) A Cooperative Agreement for a site-specific response entered into after October 17, 1986, cannot authorize a State to contribute funds during remedial planning and then apply those contributions to the remedial action cost share (advance match).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Cooperative Agreement for a site-specific response entered into after October 17, 1986, cannot authorize a State to contribute funds during remedial planning and then apply those contributions to the remedial action cost share (advance match).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State may seek reimbursement for costs incurred under Cooperative Agreements which authorize advance match.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reimbursements are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State does not seek reimbursement, EPA will apply the advance match to off-set the State's required cost share for remedial action at the site. The State may not use advance match for credit at any other site, nor may the State receive reimbursement until the conclusion of CERCLA-funded remedial response activities. Also, the State may not use advance match for credit against cost share obligations for Core Program Cooperative Agreements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claims for advance match are subject to verification by audit.
