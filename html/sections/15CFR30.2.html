                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EEI shall be filed through the AES  by the United States Principal Party In Interest (USPPI), the USPPI's  authorized agent, or the authorized U.S. agent of the Foreign Principal  Party In Interest (FPPI) for all exports of physical goods, including  shipments moving pursuant to orders received over the Internet. The  Automated Export System (AES) is the electronic system for collecting  Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) (or any successor document)  information from persons exporting goods from the United States, Puerto  Rico, Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) located in the United States or Puerto  Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, between Puerto Rico and the United  States, and to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the United States or Puerto  Rico. Exceptions, exclusions, and exemptions to this requirement are  provided for in paragraph (d) of this section and Subpart D of this  part. References to the AES also shall apply to AESDirect unless  otherwise specified. For purposes of the regulations in this part, the  SED   information shall be referred to as EEI. Filing through the AES shall be  done in accordance with the definitions, specifications, and  requirements of the regulations in this part for all export shipments,  except as specifically excluded in Sec. 30.2(d) or exempted in Subpart  D of this part, when shipped as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To foreign countries or areas, including free (foreign trade)  zones located therein (see Sec. 30.36 for exemptions for shipments from  the United States to Canada) from any of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The United States, including the 50 states and the District of  Columbia.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> FTZs located in the United States or Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Between any of the following nonforeign areas including goods  previously admitted to customs warehouses or FTZs and moving under a  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) bond:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To Puerto Rico from the United States.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To the United States from Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> To the U.S. Virgin Islands from the United States or Puerto  Rico.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The EEI shall be filed for goods moving as described in  paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section by any mode of  transportation. (Instructions for filing EEI for vessels, aircraft,  railway cars, and other carriers when sold while outside the areas  described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) are covered in Sec. 30.26.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Notwithstanding exemptions in Subpart D, EEI shall be filed for  the following types of export shipments, regardless of value:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Requiring a Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and  Security (BIS) license (15 CFR 730-774).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Requiring a Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls (DDTC) license under the International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120 through 130).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Subject to the ITAR, but exempt from license requirements.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Requiring a Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) export permit (21 CFR 1312).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Requiring a general or specific export license issued by the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under 10 CFR part 110.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Requiring an export license issued by any other federal  government agency.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Classified as rough diamonds under 6-digit HS subheadings  7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S.  Customs and Border Protection regulations, except as noted in CBP  regulations.</p><p class="depth5">Note to paragraph (a)(1)(iv): For the filing requirement for exports  destined for a country in Country Group E:1 as set forth in the  Supplement No. 1 to 15 CFR part 740, see FTR Sec. 30.16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Filing methods. The USPPI has four means for filing EEI: use  AESDirect; develop AES software using the AESTIR (see ); purchase  software developed by certified vendors using the AESTIR; or use an  authorized agent. An FPPI can only use an authorized agent in a routed  transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EEI shall be filed prior to  exportation (see Sec. 30.4) unless the USPPI has been approved to  submit export data on a postdeparture basis (see Sec. 30.5(c)).  Shipments requiring a license or license exemption may be filed  postdeparture only when the appropriate licensing agency has granted the  USPPI authorization. See Subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific data elements required for EEI filing are contained in  Sec. 30.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3).)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Instructions for particular types of transactions and exemptions  from these requirements are found in Subparts C and D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The EEI is required to be filed in the AES prior to export for  shipments by vessel going directly to the countries identified in U.S.  Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and by aircraft  going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S.   Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification and filing requirements. Filers of EEI shall be  required to meet application, certification, and filing requirements  before being approved to submit EEI. Steps leading toward approval for  the AES or the AESDirect filing include the following processes: (See  Sec. 30.5 for specific application, certification, and filing standards  applicable to AES and AESDirect submissions.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submission of an electronic AES Participant Application (APA)  for AES filing or submission of an online registration for filing  through http://www.census.gov/aes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Successful completion of certification testing for AES or for  AESDirect filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exclusions from filing EEI. The following types of transactions  are outside the scope of this part and shall be excluded from EEI  filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Goods shipped under CBP bond through the United States, Puerto  Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands from one foreign country or area to  another where such goods do not enter the consumption channels of the  United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, goods shipped  from the U.S. territories and goods shipped between the United States  and these territories do not require EEI filing. However, goods  transiting U.S. territories to foreign destinations require EEI filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic transmissions and intangible transfers. (See Subpart  B of this part for export control requirements for these types of  transactions.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Goods shipped to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba from the  United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands and from  Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S.  Virgin Islands.

Failure of the USPPI, the authorized agent of either  the USPPI or the FPPI, the exporting carrier, or any other person  subject thereto to comply with any of the requirements of the  regulations in this part renders such persons subject to the penalties  provided for in Subpart H of this part.
