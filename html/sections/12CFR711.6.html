                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption. NCUA may, by agency order issued following receipt of an application, exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in Sec. 711.3, if NCUA finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, and would not present other safety and soundness concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presumptions. In reviewing applications for an exemption under this section, NCUA will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if the depository organization seeking to add a management official:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primarily serves, low- and moderate-income areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a minority group or women;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is a depository institution that has been chartered for less than two years; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is deemed to be in ``troubled condition'' as defined in Sec. 701.14(b)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration. Unless a shorter expiration period is provided in the NCUA approval, an exemption permitted by paragraph (a) of this section may continue so long as it would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, or be unsafe or unsound. If the NCUA grants an interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless otherwise provided in the approval.
