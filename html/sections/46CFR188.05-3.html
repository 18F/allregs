                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New vessels. In this application of the regulations in this  subchapter, a new vessel is meant to be one, the construction of which  is contracted for on or after March 1, 1968, or the major alteration of  a vessel is contracted for on or after March 1, 1968, or the conversion  of any vessel not previously inspected and certificated by the Coast  Guard which is contracted for on or after March 1, 1968.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing vessels. In the application of the regulations in this  subchapter an existing vessel is meant to be one which is holding a  valid certificate of inspection as an oceanographic research vessel on  March 1, 1968.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other vessels. When it is desired to have a vessel, which has  been used in trade or for recreational purposes, initially inspected and  certificated as an oceanographic research vessel on or after March 1,  1968, such vessel shall be subject to all the requirements governing a  vessel contracted for on or after March 1, 1968. However, if such vessel  has a current certificate of inspection as a passenger, tank, cargo, or  miscellaneous vessel, the Commandant may authorize its inspection and  certification under this subchapter as a vessel contracted for prior to  March 1, 1968, subject to those requirements necessitated by change in  service.
