The balance of the cautionary information may appear together on another panel provided the front panel bears a statement such as ``Read carefully other cautions on ------ panel,'' the blank being filled in with the identification of the specific label panel bearing the balance of the cautionary labeling. It is recommended that a borderline be used in conjunction with the cautionary labeling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an article has additional hazards, or contains ingredients listed in Sec. 1500.14 as requiring special labeling, appropriate additional front and rear panel precautionary labeling is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Since the Commission has issued a regulation banning under the Consumer Product Safety Act extremely flammable contact adhesives covered by this labeling regulation (sec. 16 CFR part 1302), paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section are revoked as to the subject products after June 13, 1978.
