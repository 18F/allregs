When the Administrator has obtained sufficient technical information to delineate Zones A, M, or E, he/she shall delineate the tentative boundaries on a FHBM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon the effective date of the FIRM, flood insurance will continue to be available throughout the entire community at chargeable rates (i.e., subsidized) for first layer coverage of existing structures, but will be only available at risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements. Upon the effective date of a FIRM, second layer coverage is available only at risk premium rates for all structures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Detailed insurance information may be obtained from the servicing companies.
