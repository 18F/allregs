                            <p class="depth0">If, either before or after service of the notice of hearing, the  parties submit to the regional director satisfactory evidence that they  have adjusted the dispute, the regional director shall dismiss the  charge and shall withdraw the notice of hearing if notice has issued.  If, either before or after issuance of notice of hearing, the parties  submit to the regional director satisfactory evidence that they have  agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment of the dispute, the  regional director shall defer action upon the charge and shall withdraw  the notice of hearing if notice has issued. If it appears to the  regional director that the dispute has not been adjusted in accordance  with such agreed-upon methods and that an unfair labor practice within  the meaning of section 8(b)(4)(D) of the Act is occurring or has  occurred, he may issue a complaint under Sec. 102.15, and the procedure  prescribed in Sec. Sec. 102.9 to 102.51, inclusive, shall, insofar as  applicable, govern; and Sec. Sec. 102.90 to 102.92, inclusive, are  inapplicable: Provided, however, That if an agreed-upon method for  voluntary adjustment results in a determination that employees  represented by a charged union are entitled to perform the work in  dispute, the regional director shall dismiss the charge as to that union  irrespective of whether the employer has complied with that  determination.
