                                Sec. 424.19  Impact analysis and exclusions from critical habitat.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time of publication of a proposed rule to designate  critical habitat, the Secretary will make available for public comment  the draft economic analysis of the designation. The draft economic  analysis will be summarized in the Federal Register notice of the  proposed designation of critical habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to finalizing the designation of critical habitat, the  Secretary will consider the probable economic, national security, and  other relevant impacts of the designation upon proposed or ongoing  activities. The Secretary will consider impacts at a scale that the  Secretary determines to be appropriate, and will compare the impacts  with and without the designation. Impacts may be qualitatively or  quantitatively described.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary has discretion to exclude any particular area from  the critical habitat upon a determination that the benefits of such  exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying the particular area as  part of the critical   habitat. In identifying those benefits, in addition to the mandatory  consideration of impacts conducted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section, the Secretary may assign the weight given to any benefits  relevant to the designation of critical habitat. The Secretary, however,  will not exclude any particular area if, based on the best scientific  and commercial data available, the Secretary determines that the failure  to designate that area as critical habitat will result in the extinction  of the species concerned.
