                                Sec. 1.1034-1  Sale or exchange of residence.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonrecognition of gain; general statement. Section 1034 provides  rules for the nonrecognition of gain in certain cases where a taxpayer  sells one residence after December 31, 1953, and buys or builds, and  uses as his principal residence, another residence within specified time  limits before or after such sale. In general, if the taxpayer invests in  a new residence an amount at least as large as the adjusted sales price  of his old residence, no gain is recognized on the sale of the old  residence (see paragraph (b) of this section for definitions of adjusted  sales price, new residence, and old residence). On the other hand, if  the new residence costs the taxpayer less than the adjusted sales price  of the old residence, gain is recognized to the extent of the  difference. Thus, if an amount equal to or greater than the adjusted  sales price of an old residence is invested in a new residence,  according to the rules stated in section 1034, none of the gain (if any)  realized from the sale shall be recognized. If an amount less than such  adjusted sales price is so invested, gain shall be recognized, but only  to the extent provided in section 1034. If there is no investment in a  new residence, section 1034 is inapplicable and all of the gain shall be  recognized. Whenever, as a result of the application of section 1034,  any or all of the gain realized on the sale of an old residence is not  recognized, a corresponding reduction must be made in the basis of the  new residence. The provisions of section 1034 are mandatory, so that the  taxpayer cannot elect to have gain recognized under circumstances where  this section is applicable. Section 1034 applies only to gains; losses  are recognized or not recognized without regard to the provisions of  this section. Section 1034 affects only the amount of gain recognized,  and not the amount of gain realized (see also section 1001 and the  regulations issued thereunder). Any gain realized upon disposition of  other property in exchange for the new residence is not affected by  section 1034. For special rules relating to the sale or exchange of a  principal residence by a taxpayer who has attained age 65, see section  121 and paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.121-5. For special rules relating to a  case where real property with respect to the sale of which gain is not  recognized under this section is reacquired by the seller in partial or  full satisfaction of the indebtedness arising from such sale and resold  by him within 1 year after the date of such reacquisition, see Sec.  1.1038-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions of frequently used terms  are applicable for purposes of section 1034 (other definitions and  detailed explanations appear in subsequent paragraphs of this  regulation):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Old residence means property used by the taxpayer as his  principal residence which is the subject of a sale by him after December  31, 1953 (section 1034(a); for detailed explanation see paragraph (c)(3)  of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> New residence means property used by the taxpayer as his  principal residence which is the subject of a purchase by him (section  1034(a); for detailed explanation and limitations see paragraphs (c)(3)  and (d)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjusted sales price means the amount realized reduced by the  fixing-up expenses (section 1034(b)(1); for special rule applicable in  some cases to husband and wife, see paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amount realized is to be computed by subtracting,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the items which, in determining the gain from the  sale of the old residence, are properly an offset against the  consideration received upon the sale (such as commissions and expenses  of advertising the property for sale, of preparing the deed, and of  other legal services in connection with the sale); from</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the consideration so received, determined (in  accordance with section 1001(b) and regulations issued thereunder) by  adding to the sum of any money so received, the fair market value of the  property (other than money) so received. If, as part of the  consideration for the sale, the purchaser either assumes a liability of  the taxpayer or acquires the old residence subject to a liability  (whether or not the taxpayer is personally liable on the debt), such  assumption or acquisition, in the amount of the liability, shall be  treated as money received by the taxpayer in computing the amount  realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Gain realized is the excess (if any) of the amount realized over  the adjusted basis of the old residence (see also section 1001(a) and  regulations issued thereunder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fixing-up expenses means the aggregate of the expenses for work  performed (in any taxable year, whether beginning before, on, or after  January 1, 1954) on the old residence in order to assist in its sale,  provided that such expenses (i) are incurred for work performed during  the 90-day period ending on the day on which the contract to sell the  old residence is entered into; and (ii) are paid on or before the 30th  day after the date of the sale of the old residence; and (iii) are  neither (a) allowable as deductions in computing taxable income under  section 63(a), nor (b) taken into account in computing the amount  realized from the sale of the old residence (section 1034(b) (2) and  (3)). Fixing-up expenses does not include expenditures which are  properly chargeable to capital account and which would, therefore,  constitute adjustments to the basis of the old residence (see section  1016 and regulations issued thereunder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cost of purchasing the new residence means the total of all  amounts which are attributable to the acquisition, construction,  reconstruction, and improvements constituting capital expenditures, made  during the period beginning 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of  an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) before the date of sale of  the old residence and ending either (i) 18 months (one year in the case  of a sale of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date  in the case of a new residence purchased but not constructed by the  taxpayer, or (ii) two years (18 months in the case of a sale of an old  residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date in the case of a new  residence the construction of which was commenced by the taxpayer before  the expiration of 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of an old  residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date (section 1034(a),  (c)(2) and (c)(5); for detailed explanation, see paragraph (c)(4) of  this section; for special rule applicable in some cases to husband and  wife, see paragraph (f) of this section; see also paragraph (b)(9) of  this section for definition of purchase).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Sale (of a residence) means a sale or an exchange (of a  residence) for other property which occurs after December 31, 1953, an  involuntary conversion (of a residence) which occurs after December 31,  1950, and before January   1, 1954, or certain involuntary conversions where the disposition of the  property occurs after December 31, 1957, in respect of which a proper  election is made under section 1034(i)(2) (see sections 1034(c)(1),  1034(i)(1)(A), and 1034(i)(2); for detailed explanation concerning  involuntary conversions, see paragraph (h) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Purchase (of a residence) means a purchase or an acquisition (of  a residence) on the exchange of property or the partial or total  construction or reconstruction (of a residence) by the taxpayer (section  1034(c) (1) and (2)). However, the mere improvement of a residence, not  amounting to reconstruction, does not constitute purchase of a  residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules for application of section 1034--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule;  limitations on applicability. Gain realized from the sale (after  December 31, 1953) of an old residence will be recognized only to the  extent that the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old residence  exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence, provided  that the taxpayer either (i) within a period beginning 18 months (one  year in the case of a sale of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975)  before the date of such sale and ending 18 months (one year in the case  of a sale of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date  purchases property and uses it as his principal residence, or (ii)  within a period beginning 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of  an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) before the date of such sale  and ending two years (18 months in the case of a sale of an old  residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date uses as his  principal residence a new residence the construction of which was  commenced by him at any time before the expiration of 18 months (one  year in the case of a sale of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975)  after the date of the sale of the old residence (section 1034 (a) and  (c)(5); for detailed explanation of use as principal residence see  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). The rule stated in the preceding  sentence applies to a new residence purchased by the taxpayer before the  date of sale of the old residence provided the new residence is still  owned by him on such date (section 1034(c)(3)). Whether the construction  of a new residence was commenced by the taxpayer before the expiration  of 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of an old residence prior  to January 1, 1975) after the date of the sale of the old residence will  depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Section 1034 is  not applicable to the sale of a residence if within the previous 18  months (previous year in the case of a sale of an old residence prior to  January 1, 1975) the taxpayer made another sale of residential property  on which gain was realized but not recognized (section 1034(d)). For  further details concerning limitations on the application of section  1034, see paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computation and examples. In applying the general rule stated in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxpayer should first subtract  the commissions and other selling expenses from the selling price of his  old residence, to determine the amount realized. A comparison of the  amount realized with the cost or other basis of the old residence will  then indicate whether there is any gain realized on the sale. Unless the  amount realized is greater than the cost or other basis, no gain is  realized and section 1034 does not apply. If the amount realized exceeds  the cost or other basis, the amount of such excess constitutes the gain  realized. The amount realized should then be reduced by the fixing-up  expenses (if any), to determined the adjusted sales price. A comparison  of the adjusted sales price of the old residence with the cost of  purchasing the new residence will indicate how much (if any) of the  realized gain is to be recognized. If the cost of purchasing the new  residence is the same as, or greater than, the adjusted sales price of  the old residence, then none of the realized gain is to be recognized.  On the other hand, if the cost of purchasing the new residence is  smaller than the adjusted sales price of the old residence, the gain  realized, all of the gain realized is to be recognized to the extent of  the difference. It should be noted that any amount of gain realized but  not recognized is to be applied as a downward adjustment to the basis of  the new residence (for details see paragraph (e) of this section).) The  application of the   general rule stated above may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A taxpayer decides to sell his residence, which has a  basis of $17,500. To make it more attractive to buyers, he paints the  outside at a cost of $300 in April, 1954. He pays for the painting when  the work is finished. In May, 1954, he sells the house for $20,000.  Brokers' commissions and other selling expenses are $1,000. In October,  1954, the taxpayer buys a new residence for $18,000. The amount  realized, the gain realized, the adjusted sales price, and the gain to  be recognized are computed as follows:  Selling price.................................................   $20,000 Less: Commissions and other selling expenses..................     1,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Amount realized...............................................    19,000 Less: Basis...................................................    17,500</p><p class="depth0">--------- Gain realized.................................................     1,500</p><p class="depth0">========= Amount realized...............................................    19,000 Less: Fixing-up expenses......................................       300</p><p class="depth0">--------- Adjusted sales price..........................................    18,700 Cost of purchasing new residence..............................    18,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Gain recognized...............................................       700 Gain realized but not recognized..............................       800 Adjusted basis of new residence (see paragraph (e) of this        17,200</p><p class="depth0">section).....................................................</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the  selling price of the old residence is $18,500.

No adjustment to the basis of the new residence is to be  made.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the  cost of purchasing the new residence is $17,000. The computations are as  follows:  Selling price.................................................   $20,000 Less: Commissions and other selling expenses..................     1,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Amount realized...............................................    19,000 Less: Basis...................................................    17,500</p><p class="depth0">--------- Gain realized.................................................     1,500</p><p class="depth0">========= Amount realized...............................................    19,000 Less: Fixing-up expenses......................................       300</p><p class="depth0">--------- Adjusted sales price..........................................    18,700 Cost of purchasing the new residence..........................    17,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Gain recognized...............................................     1,500</p><p class="depth0">Note: Since the adjusted sales price of the old residence exceeds  the cost of purchasing the new residence by $1,700, which is more than  the gain realized, all of the gain realized is recognized.

The mere fact that property  is, or has been, rented is not determinative that such property is not  used by the taxpayer as his principal residence. For example, if the  taxpayer purchases his new residence before he sells his old residence,  the fact that he temporarily rents out the new residence during the  period before he vacates the old residence may not, in the light of all  the facts and circumstances in the case, prevent the new residence from  being considered as property used by the taxpayer as his principal  residence. Property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence may  include a houseboat, a house trailer, or stock held by a tenant- stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation (as those terms are  defined in section 216(b) (1) and (2)), if the dwelling which the  taxpayer is entitled to   occupy as such stockholder is used by him as his principal residence  (section 1034(f)). Property used by the taxpayer as his principal  residence does not include personal property such as a piece of  furniture, a radio, etc., which, in accordance with the applicable local  law, is not a fixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where part of a property is used by the taxpayer as his  principal residence and part is used for other purposes, an allocation  must be made to determine the application of this section. If the old  residence is used only partially for residential purposes, only that  part of the gain allocable to the residential portion is not to be  recognized under this section and only an amount allocable to the  selling price of such portion need be invested in the new residence in  order to have the gain allocable to such portion not recognized under  this section. If the new residence is used only partially for  residential purposes only so much of its cost as is allocable to the  residential portion may be counted as the cost of purchasing the new  residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cost of purchasing new residence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's cost of  purchasing the new residence includes not only cash but also any  indebtedness to which the property purchased is subject at the time of  purchase whether or not assumed by the taxpayer (including purchase- money mortgages, etc.) and the face amount of any liabilities of the  taxpayer which are part of the consideration for the purchase.  Commissions and other purchasing expenses paid or incurred by the  taxpayer on the purchase of the new residence are to be included in  determining such cost. In the case of an acquisition of a residence upon  an exchange which is considered as a purchase under this section, the  fair market value of the new residence on the date of the exchange shall  be considered as the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence.  Where any part of the new residence is acquired by the taxpayer other  than by purchase, the value of such part is not to be included in  determining the taxpayer's cost of the new residence (see paragraph  (b)(9) of this section for definition of purchase). For example, if the  taxpayer acquires a residence by gift or inheritance, and spends $20,000  in reconstructing such residence, only such $20,000 may be treated as  his cost of purchasing the new residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence includes  only so much of such cost as is attributable to acquisition,  construction, reconstruction, or improvements made within the period of  three years or 42 months (two years or 30 months in the case of a sale  of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975), as the case may be, in  which the purchase and use of the new residence must be made in order to  have gain on the sale of the old residence not recognized under this  section. Thus, if the construction of the new residence is begun three  years before the date of sale of the old residence and completed on the  date of sale of the old residence, only that portion of the cost which  is attributable to the last 18 months (last year in the case of a sale  of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) of such construction  constitutes the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence, for  purposes of section 1034. Furthermore, the taxpayer's cost of purchasing  the new residence includes only such amounts as are properly chargeable  to capital account rather than to current expense. As to what  constitutes capital expenditures, see section 263.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: M began the construction of a new residence on January 15,  1974, and completed it on October 14, 1974. The cost of $45,000 was  incurred ratably over the 9-month period of construction. On December  14, 1975, M sold his old residence and realized a gain. In determining  the extent to which the realized gain is not to be recognized under  section 1034, M's cost of constructing the new residence shall include  only the $20,000 which was attributable to the June 15--October 14,  1974, period (4 months at $5,000). The $25,000 balance of the cost of  constructing the new residence was not attributable to the period  beginning 18 months before the date of the sale of the old residence and  ending two years after such date and, under section 1034, is not  properly a part of M's cost of constructing the new residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitations on application of section 1034. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a residence  is purchased by the taxpayer prior to the date of the sale of the old  residence, the purchased residence shall, in no event, be treated   as a new residence if such purchased residence is sold or otherwise  disposed of by him prior to the date of the sale of the old residence  (section 1034(c)(3)). And, if the taxpayer, during the period within  which the purchase and use of the new residence must be made in order to  have any gain on the sale of the old residence not recognized under this  section, purchases more than one property which is used by him as his  principal residence during the 18 months (or two years in the case of  the construction of the new residence) succeeding the date of the sale  of the old residence, only the last of such properties shall be  considered a new residence (section 1034(c)(4)). In the case of a sale  of an old residence prior to January 1, 1975, the period of 18 months  (or two years) referred to in the preceding sentence shall be one year  (or 18 months). If within 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of  an old residence prior to January 1, 1975) before the date of the sale  of the old residence, the taxpayer sold other property used by him as  his principal residence at a gain, and any part of such gain was not  recognized under this section or section 112(n) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939, this section shall not apply with respect to the sale of  the old residence (section 1034(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following example will illustrate the rules of subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example: A taxpayer sells his old residence on January 15, 1954, and  purchases another residence on February 15, 1954. On March 15, 1954, he  sells the residence which he bought on February 15, 1954, and purchases  another residence on April 15, 1954. The gain on the sale of the old  residence on January 15, 1954, will not be recognized except to the  extent to which the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old residence  exceeds the cost of purchasing the residence which he purchased on April  15, 1954. Gain on the sale of the residence which was bought on February  15, 1954, and sold on March 15, 1954, will be recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Basis of new residence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the purchase of a new  residence results, under this section, in the nonrecognition of any part  of the gain realized upon the sale of an old residence, then, in  determining the adjusted basis of the new residence as of any time  following the sale of the old residence, the adjustments to basis shall  include a reduction by an amount equal to the amount of the gain which  was not recognized upon the sale of the old residence (section 1034(e);  for special rule applicable in some cases to husband and wife, see  paragraph (f) of this section). Such a reduction is not to be made for  the purpose of determining the adjusted basis of the new residence as of  any time preceding the sale of the old residence. For the purpose of  this determination, the amount of the gain not recognized under this  section upon the sale of the old residence includes only so much of the  gain as is not recognized because of the taxpayer's cost, up to the date  of the determination of the adjusted basis, of purchasing the new  residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following example will illustrate the rule of subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example: On January 1, 1954, the taxpayer buys a new residence for  $10,000. On March 1, 1954, he sells for an adjusted sales price of  $15,000 his old residence, which has an adjusted basis to him of $5,000  (no fixing-up expenses are involved, so that $15,000 is the amount  realized as well as the adjusted sales price). Between April 1 and April  15 a wing is constructed on the new house at a cost of $5,000. Between  May 1 and May 15 a garage is constructed at a cost of $2,000. The  adjusted basis of the new residence is $10,000 during January and  February, $5,000 during March, $5,000 following the completion of the  construction in April, and $7,000 following the completion of the  construction in May. Since the old residence was not sold until March 1,  no adjustment to the basis of the new residence is made during January  and February.

Such consent may be  filed only if the old residence and the new residence are each used by  the taxpayer and his same spouse as their principal residence. If the  taxpayer and his spouse do not file such a consent, the recognition of  gain upon sale of the old residence shall be determined under this  section without regard to the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The consent referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is  a consent by the taxpayer and his spouse to have the basis of the  interest of either of them in the new residence reduced from what it  would have been but for the filing of such consent by an amount by which  the gain of either of them on the sale of his interest in the old  residence is not recognized solely by reason of the filing of such  consent. Such reduction in basis is applicable to the basis of the new  residence, whether such basis is that of the husband, of the wife, or  divided between them. If the basis is divided between the husband and  wife, the reduction in basis shall be divided between them in the same  proportion as the basis (determined without regard to such reduction) is  divided. Such consent shall be filed with the district director with  whom the taxpayer filed the return for the taxable year or years in  which the gain from the sale of the old residence was realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following examples will illustrate the application of this  rule:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A taxpayer, in 1954, sells for an adjusted sales price of  $10,000 the principal residence of himself and his wife, which he owns  individually and which has an adjusted basis to him of $5,000 (no  fixing-up expenses are involved, so that $10,000 is the amount realized  as well as the adjusted sales price). Within a year after such sale he  and his wife contribute $5,000 each from their separate funds for the  purchase of their new principal residence which they hold as tenants in  common, each owning an undivided one-half interest therein. If the  taxpayer and his wife file the required consent, the gain of $5,000 upon  the sale of the old residence will not be recognized to the taxpayer,  and the adjusted basis of the taxpayer's interest in the new residence  will be $2,500 and the adjusted basis of his wife's interest in such  property will be $2,500.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A taxpayer and his wife, in 1954, sell for an adjusted  sales price of $10,000 their principal residence, which they own as  joint tenants and which has an adjusted basis of $2,500 to each of them  ($5,000 together) (no fixing-up expenses are involved, so that $10,000  is the amount realized as well as the adjusted sales price). Within a  year after such sale, the wife spends $10,000 of her own funds in the  purchase of a principal residence for herself and the taxpayer and takes  title in her name only. If the taxpayer and his wife file the required  consent, the adjusted basis to the wife of the new residence will be  $5,000, and the gain of the taxpayer will be $2,500 upon the sale of the  old residence will not be recognized. The wife, as a taxpayer herself,  will have her gain of $2,500 on the sale of the old residence not  recognized under the general rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Members of Armed Forces. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 1034(h) provides a special  rule for members of the Armed Forces with respect to the period after  the sale of the old residence within which the acquisition of a new  residence may result in a non-recognition of gain on such sale. The  running of the period of 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of an  old residence prior to January 1, 1975) after the sale of the old  residence in the case   of the purchase of a new residence, or the period of two years (18  months in the case of a sale of an old residence prior to January 12,  1975) after such sale in the case of the construction of a new  residence, is suspended during any time that the taxpayer serves on  extended active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States. (This  paragraph applies to time served on extended active duty prior to July  1, 1973, only if such extended active duty occurred during an induction  period as defined in section 112(c)(5) as in effect prior to July 1,  1973.) However, in no event may such suspension extend for more than  four years after the date of the sale of the old residence the period  within which the purchase or construction of a new residence may result  in a nonrecognition of gain. For example, if the taxpayer is on extended  active duty with the Army from January 1, 1975, to June 30, 1976, and if  he sold his old residence on January 10, 1975, the latest date on which  the taxpayer may use a new residence constructed by him and have any  part of the gain on the sale of his old residence not recognized under  this section is June 30, 1978 (the date two years following the  taxpayer's termination of active duty). However, if this taxpayer were  on extended active duty with the Army from January 1, 1975, to December  31, 1978, the latest date on which he might use a new residence  constructed by him and have any part of the gain on the sale of his old  residence not recognized under this section would be January 10, 1979  (the date four years following the date of the sale of the old  residence).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This suspension covers not only the Armed Forces service of the  taxpayer but if the taxpayer and his same spouse used both the old and  the new residences as their principal residence, then the extension  applies in like manner to the time the taxpayer's spouse is on extended  active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The time during which the running of the period is suspended is  part of such period. Thus, construction costs during such time are  includible in the cost of purchasing the new residence under paragraph  (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> and  in paragraph (d) of this section is not suspended. The running of the  18-month period prior to the date of the sale of the old residence  within which the new residence may be purchased in order to have gain on  the sale of the old residence not recognized under this section is also  not suspended. In the case of a sale of an old residence prior to  January 1, 1975, the periods of 18 months (or two years) referred to in  each of the two preceding sentences shall be one year (or 18 months).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The term extended active duty means any period of active duty  which is served pursuant to a call or order to such duty for a period in  excess of 90 days or for an indefinite period. If the call or order is  for a period of more than 90 days, it is immaterial that the time served  pursuant to such call or order is less than 90 days, if the reason for  such shorter period of service occurs after the beginning of such duty.  As to what constitutes active service as a member of the Armed Forces of  the United States, see paragraph (i) of Sec. 1.112-1. As to who are  members of the Armed Forces of the United States, see section  7701(a)(15), and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter  (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rules for involuntary conversions--(1) In general.  Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, section 1034  is inapplicable to involuntary conversions of personal residences  occurring after December 31, 1953 (section 1034(i)(1)(B)). For purposes  of section 1034, an involuntary conversion of a personal residence  occurring after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1954, is  treated as a sale of such residence (section 1034(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em>; see  paragraph (b)(8) of this section). For purposes of this paragraph, an  involuntary conversion is defined, as the destruction in whole or in  part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, or the  sale or exchange of property under threat or imminence thereof. See  section 1033 and Sec. 1.1033(a)-3 for treatment of residences  involuntarily converted after December 31, 1953.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election to treat condemnation of personal residence as sale.  (i) Section 1034</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em> provides a special rule which permits a taxpayer  to elect to treat the seizure, requisition, or condemnation of his  principal residence, or the sale or exchange of such residence under  threat or imminence thereof, if occurring after December 31, 1957, as  the sale of such residence for purposes of section 1034 (relating to  sale or exchange of residence). A taxpayer may thus elect to have  section 1034 apply, rather than section 1033 (relating to involuntary  conversions), in determining the amount of gain realized on the  disposition of his old residence that will not be recognized and the  extent to which the basis of his new residence acquired in lieu thereof  shall be reduced. Once made, the election shall be irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the taxpayer elects to be governed by the provisions of  section 1034, section 1033 will have no application. Thus, a taxpayer  who elects under section 1034(i)(2) to treat the seizure, requisition,  or condemnation of his principal residence (but not the destruction), or  the sale or exchange of such residence under threat or imminence  thereof, as a sale for the purpose of section 1034 must satisfy the  requirements of section 1034 and this section. For example, under  section 1034 a taxpayer generally must replace his old residence with a  new residence which he uses as his principal residence, within a period  beginning 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of an old residence  prior to January 1, 1975) before the date of disposition of his old  residence, and ending 18 months (one year in the case of a sale of an  old residence prior to January 1, 1975) after such date. However, in the  case of a new residence the construction of which was commenced by the  taxpayer within such period, the replacement period shall not expire  until 2 years (18 months in the case of a sale of an old residence prior  to January 1, 1975) after the date of disposition of the old residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Time and manner of making election. The election under section  1034(i)(2) shall be made in a statement attached to the taxpayer's  income tax return, when filed, for the taxable year during which the  disposition of his old residence occurs. The statement shall indicate  that the taxpayer elects under section 1034(i)(2) to treat the  disposition of his old residence as a sale for purposes of section 1034,  and shall also show--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The basis of the old residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The date of its disposition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The adjusted sales price of the old residence, if known; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The purchase price, date of purchase, and date of occupancy of  the new residence if it has been acquired prior to the time of making  the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Statute of limitations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a taxpayer sells property  used as his principal residence at a gain, the statutory period  prescribed in section 6501(a) for the assessment of a deficiency  attributable to any part of such gain shall not expire prior to the  expiration of three years from the date of receipt, by the district  director with whom the return was filed for the taxable year or years in  which the gain from the sale of the old residence was realized (section  1034(j)), of a written notice from the taxpayer of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence which the  taxpayer claims result in nonrecognition of any part of such gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's intention not to purchase a new residence within  the period when such a purchase will result in nonrecognition of any  part of such gain, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer's failure to make such a purchase within such  period.  Any gain from the sale of the old residence which is required to be  recognized shall be included in gross income for the taxable year or  years in which such gain was realized. Any deficiency attributable to  any portion of such gain may be assessed before the expiration of the 3- year period described in this paragraph, notwithstanding the provisions  of any law or rule of law which might otherwise bar such assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The notification required by the preceding subparagraph shall  contain all pertinent details in connection with the sale of the old  residence and, where applicable, the purchase price of the new  residence. The notification shall be in the form of a written statement   and shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by an amended return for  the year in which the gain from the sale of the old residence was  realized, in order to reflect the inclusion in gross income for that  year of gain required to be recognized in connection with such sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date. Pursuant to section 7851(a)(1)(C), paragraphs  (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) of this section apply in the case  of any sale (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section) made after  December 31, 1953, although such sale may occur in a taxable year  subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Similarly, the rule in  paragraph (h) of this section that involuntary conversions of personal  residences are not to be treated as sales for purposes of section 1034  but are governed by section 1033 applies to any such involuntary  conversion made after December 31, 1953, although such involuntary  conversion may occur in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939. The rule in paragraph (e) of this section requiring an  adjustment to the basis of a new residence, the purchase of which  results (under section 1034, or section 112(n) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939) in the nonrecognition of gain on the sale of an old  residence, applies in determining the adjusted basis of the new  residence at any time following such sale, although such sale may occur  in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
