                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory provisions. Under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and the authority and responsibility delegated to him/her by the Secretary of Labor (36 FR 8755) and by the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards (39 FR 3384l), the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division is authorized and directed, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, to provide by regulation or order for the employment, under certificates, of full-time students in institutions of higher education. That section contains provisions requiring a wage rate in such certificates of not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act, limiting weekly hours of employment, stipulating compliance with the applicable child-labor standards, and safeguarding against the reduction of the full-time employment opportunities of employees other than full-time students employed under certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Source of limitations. Some of the limitations expressed in this subpart are specifically required in section 14(b) of the Act. The other limitations implement the provisions relating to employment opportunities, i.e., the ``extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment'' and the requirement that the regulations shall ``prescribe standards and requirements to insure that this paragraph will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those to whom the minimum wage rate authorized by'' section 14(b) of the Act is applicable.
