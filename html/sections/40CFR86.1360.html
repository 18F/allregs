                            <p class="depth0">The test procedures of this subpart N apply for supplemental  emission testing, except as specified otherwise in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to 2007 and later diesel  heavy duty engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test cycle. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform testing as described in Sec. 86.1362 for  determining whether an engine meets the applicable standards when  measured over the supplemental emission test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines not certified to a NOX standard or FEL  less than 1.5 g/bhp-hr, EPA may select, and require the manufacturer to  conduct the test using, up to three discrete test points within the  control area defined in paragraph (d) of this section. EPA will notify  the manufacturer of these supplemental test points in writing in a  timely manner before the test. Emission sampling for these discrete test  modes must include all regulated pollutants except particulate matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For engines certified using the ramped-modal cycle specified in  Sec. 86.1362, perform the three discrete test points described in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Allow the engine to idle as needed to complete equipment checks  following the supplemental emission test described in this section, then  operate the engine over the three additional discrete test points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Validate the additional discrete test points as a composite  test separate from the supplemental emission test, but in the same  manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use the emission data collected during the time interval from  35 to 5 seconds before the end of each mode (excluding transitions) to  perform the MAEL calculations in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The engine speeds A, B and C, referenced in the table in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, must be determined as follows:  Speed A = nlo + 0.25 x (nhi - nlo) Speed B = nlo + 0.50 x (nhi - nlo) Speed C = nlo + 0.75 x (nhi - nlo) Where: nhi = High speed as determined by calculating 70% of</p><p class="depth2">the maximum power. The highest engine speed where this power</p><p class="depth2">value occurs on the power curve is defined as nhi. nlo = Low speed as determined by calculating 50% of the</p><p class="depth2">maximum power. The lowest engine speed where this power value</p><p class="depth2">occurs on the power curve is defined as nlo. Maximum power = the maximum observed power calculated according to the</p><p class="depth2">engine mapping procedures defined in 40 CFR 1065.510.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determining the control area. The control area extends from the  engine speed A to C, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, and  extends from 25 to 100 percent load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> depicts a sample Maximum Allowable Emission Limit curve, for  illustration purposes only, as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.006</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the weighted average emissions, calculated according to  paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for any gaseous pollutant is equal to  or lower than required by Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3), each of the 13 test  values for that pollutant shall first be multiplied by the ratio of the  applicable emission standard (under Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3)) to the  weighted average emissions value, and then by 1.10 for interpolation  allowance, before determining the Maximum Allowable Emission Limits  under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Maximum Allowable Emission Limit for any point, as  calculated under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, is greater  than the applicable Not-to-Exceed limit (if within the Not-to-Exceed  control area defined in Sec. 86.1370(b)), then the Maximum Allowable  Emission Limit for that point shall be defined as the applicable Not-to- Exceed limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Calculating intermediate test points. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the three test  points selected by EPA under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the  emissions must be measured and calculated as described in paragraph  (e)(6)(i) of this section (except that n = 1 and WF = 1). The measured  values then must be compared to the interpolated values according to  paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The interpolated values are determined  from the modes of the test cycle closest to the respective test point  according to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For these modes (R, S, T, U), the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Speed (R) = Speed(T) = nRT.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Speed (S) = Speed(U) = nSU.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Per cent load (R) = Per cent load (S).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Per cent load (T) = Per cent load (U).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The interpolated value of the brake specific gaseous emissions  of the selected control point Z(EZ) must be calculated as follows:  EZ = ERS + (ETU-ERS) *  (MZ-MRS) / (MTU-MRS)  ETU = ET + (EU-ET) *  (nZ-nRT) / (nSU-nRT)  ERS = ER + (ES-ER) *  (nZ-nRT) / (nSU-nRT)  MTU = MT + (MU-MT) *  (nZ-nRT) / (nSU-nRT)  MRS = MR + (MS-MR) *  (nZ-nRT) / (nSU-nRT)  Where:  ER, ES, ET, EU = for each</p><p class="depth4">regulated pollutant, brake specific gaseous emissions of the</p><p class="depth4">enveloping modes adjusted according to the factors in(f)(2).
