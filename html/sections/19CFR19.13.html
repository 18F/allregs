Each bonded manufacturing warehouse shall have a  secured area separated from the remainder of the premises to be used  exclusively for the storage of imported merchandise, domestic spirits,  and merchandise subject to internal-revenue tax transferred into the  warehouse for manufacture. A like area shall be provided to be used  exclusively for the storage of products manufactured in the warehouse.  The area shall be secured to prevent any unauthorized person from having  access thereto and the goods therein shall be arranged in a manner to  assist a Customs officer in making the required examination or taking  samples for analysis. The areas for storage of bonded material and  manufactured products shall be secured in accordance with the standards  prescribed in Sec. 19.4(b)(6) of this part.
