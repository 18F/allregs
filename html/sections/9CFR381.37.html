                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except  under the supervision of an Inspection Service employee. All  eviscerating of poultry and further processing shall be done with  reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of  mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption  in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30  minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration.  Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to  time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall   not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the  beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after  operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than  30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start  of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to  meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as  5\1/2\ hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be  provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 hours per shift  during the basic workweek subject to the provisions of Sec. 381.38:  Provided, That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by  the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5  consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday  through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall  schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour  days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but  shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry  out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection  program personnel to put on required gear, pick up required forms and  walk to a work station; and the time for FSIS inspection program  personnel to return from a work station, drop off required forms, and  remove required gear; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including  administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek  in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously  handicap the Department in carrying out its functions. These provisions  are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as  provided in Sec. 381.145(h) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to  the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the  approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area  supervisor shall take in account the efficient and effective use of  inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify the workweek, daily  clock hours of operation, and lunch periods for all departments of the  establishment requiring inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any  request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving  changes in the workweek or an addition or elimination of shifts shall be  submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the  proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved:  Provided, however, Minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may  be approved by the inspector in charge if such request is received on  the day preceding the day of change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for inspection service outside an approved work  schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work  to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of  the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service  at the start of the following day: Provided, That an inspector may be  recalled to his assignment after the completion of his daily tour of  duty under the provisions of Sec. 381.39(b).
