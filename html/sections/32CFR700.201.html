                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The naval affairs of the country began with the war for  independence, the American Revolution. On 13 October 1775, Congress  passed legislation for ships. This, in effect, created the continental  Navy. Two battalions of Marines were authorized on 10 November 1775.  Under the Constitution, the First Congress on 7 August 1789 assigned  responsibility for the conduct of naval affairs to the War Department.  On 30 April 1798, the Congress established a separate Department of the  Navy with the Secretary of the Navy as its chief officer. On 11 July  1798, the United States Marine Corps was established as a separate  service, and in 1834 was made a part of the Department of the Navy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The National Security Act of 1947, as amended, is the  fundamental law governing the position of the Department of the Navy in  the organization for national defense. In 1949, the Act was amended to  establish the Department of Defense as an Executive Department, and to  establish the Departments of the Army, Navy and Air   Force (formerly established as Executive Departments by the 1947 Act) as  military departments within the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act  of 1986 further defined the roles of the military departments within the  Department of Defense. In addition to establishing the office of Vice  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and further emphasizing the  operational chain of command, the Act provided detailed statements of  the roles of the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations,  the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and their respective principal  assistants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The responsibilities and authority of the Department of the Navy  are vested in the Secretary of the Navy, and are subject to reassignment  and delegation by the Secretary. The Secretary is bound by the  provisions of law, the direction of the President and the Secretary of  Defense and, along with all persons in charge of Government agencies,  the regulations of certain non-defense agencies addressing their  respective areas of functional responsibility.</p>
