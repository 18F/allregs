The appraisal should assume a willing buyer and a willing seller. The appraisal must be done within the 45-day period immediately preceding the date when the HFA files an application for final claim settlement. If at the time of final claim settlement the HFA has not sold the project, an appraisal should be made to determine the value of the project at its highest and best use.</p>
