                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Belated elections. On determination by an employing office that  the FERS transfer handbook issued by OPM was not available to an  individual in a timely manner or an individual was unable, for cause  beyond his or her control, to elect FERS coverage within the prescribed  time limit, the employing office may, within 6 months after the  expiration of the individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage under  Sec. 846.201, accept the individual's election of FERS coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Correction of administrative errors related to election.  During the 6-month period after the expiration of an individual's  opportunity to elect FERS coverage under Sec. 846.201, the employing  office may make prospective corrections of administrative errors  regarding an individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage, including  failure to provide the election form specified in Sec. 846.203(a) to an  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Erroneous FERS coverage for a period of less than 3 years of  service. For an employee, separated employee, or retiree whose employing  agency erroneously determined that the individual was covered by FERS  during the period under Sec. 846.201 when the individual was eligible  to elect FERS, and the employing agency should have placed the  individual in CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security-Only, under  conditions that would have included an opportunity to elect FERS  coverage, and the employee, separated employee, or retiree remained in  FERS for less than 3 years of service, the employee, separated employee,  or retiree is deemed to have elected FERS coverage and the individual  will remain covered by FERS, unless the individual declines under  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be covered by FERS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The employing agency must provide written notice to each  individual who is deemed to have elected FERS under paragraph (b)(2)(i)  of this section that the individual may, within 60 days after receiving  the notice, decline to be deemed to have transferred to FERS.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the individual dies during the election period established by  paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (C) of this section, the right of election  under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may be exercised by any person  who would be entitled to receive a current spouse survivor annuity or a  former spouse survivor annuity under CSRS (or CSRS Offset), if any, if  the error had not occurred (the election by any one such current or  former spouse not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is  controlling); otherwise, by the individual or individuals entitled to  receive the lump-sum credit under CSRS (or CSRS Offset) if the error had  not occurred (the election by any individual entitled to a share of the  lump-sum credit not to have the election of FERS coverage deemed is  controlling). The time limit for making an election under this paragraph  is 60 days after the date of the agency's notice to the individual  (survivor) of the election right.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The agency may waive the 60-day time limit under paragraphs  (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section if the individual (if living,  otherwise the appropriate survivor) exercised due diligence in making  the election but was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her  control from making the election   within the time limit. An agency decision not to waive the time limit  under this paragraph must include notice to the individual of the  individual's right to request OPM to reconsider the denial of the waiver  of the time limit. OPM's reconsideration decision on denial of a waiver  of the time limit will notify the individual of the right to appeal to  the Merit Systems Protection Board under chapter II of this title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employing agency must document the individual's records to  reflect his or her decision concerning retirement coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OPM's reconsideration. An agency decision concerning an  individual's opportunity to elect FERS coverage or the effective date of  an election of FERS coverage is subject to reconsideration by OPM under  Sec. 846.205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Correction of other administrative errors. Failure to begin  employee deductions and Government contributions on the effective date  of coverage must be corrected in accordance with Sec. 841.505 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Errors lasting for at least 3 years of service. For an employee,  separated employee, or retiree whose employing agency erroneously  determined that the individual was covered by FERS during the period  under Sec. 846.201 of this chapter when the individual was eligible to  elect FERS and the individual remained in FERS for at least 3 years of  service, the error is corrected in accordance with part 839 of this  chapter.
