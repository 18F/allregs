                                Sec. 97.19  Application for a vanity call sign.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The person named in an operator/primary station license grant or  in a club station license grant is eligible to make application for  modification of the license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a  call sign selected by the vanity call sign system. Effective February  14, 2011, the person named in a club station license grant that shows on  the license a call sign that was selected by a trustee is not eligible  for an additional vanity call sign. (The person named in a club station  license grant that shows on the license a call sign that was selected by  a trustee is eligible for a vanity call sign for his or her operator/ primary station license grant on the same basis as any other person who  holds an operator/primary station license grant.) Military recreation  stations are not eligible for a vanity call sign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each application for a modification of an operator/primary or  club station license grant, or the renewal thereof, to show a call sign  selected by the vanity call sign system must be filed in accordance with  Sec. 1.913 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unassigned call signs are available to the vanity call sign  system with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A call sign shown on an expired license grant is not available  to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the expiration of  the license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A call sign shown on a surrendered or canceled license grant  (except for a license grant that is canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31) is  not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years following the  date such action is taken. (The availability of a call sign shown on a  license canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31 is governed by paragraph (c)(3)  of this section.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) of this section that is  surrendered, canceled, revoked, voided, or set aside because the grantee  acknowledged or the Commission determined that the grantee was not  eligible for the exception. In such a case, the call sign is not  available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the date  such action is taken, or for the period for which the call sign would  not have been available to the vanity call sign system pursuant to  paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section but for the intervening grant  to the ineligible applicant, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant,  or club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee,  the call sign was previously assigned is exempt from the 2-year period  set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A call sign shown on a license canceled pursuant to Sec. 97.31  of this part is not available to the vanity call sign system for 2 years  following the person's death, or for 2 years following the expiration of  the license grant, whichever is sooner. If, however, a license is  canceled more than 2 years after the licensee's death (or within 30 days  before the second anniversary of the licensee's death), the call sign is  not available to the vanity call sign system for 30 days following the  date such action is taken. The following applicants are exempt from this  2-year period:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An applicant to whose operator/primary station license grant, or  club station license grant for which the applicant is the trustee, the  call sign was previously assigned; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant who is the spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild,  parent, grandparent, stepparent, brother, sister, stepbrother,  stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or in-law of the person now  deceased or of any other deceased former holder of the call sign,  provided that the vanity call sign requested by the applicant is from  the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of  operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential  call sign system; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An applicant who is a club station license trustee acting with  a written statement of consent signed by either the licensee ante mortem  but who is now deceased, or by at least one relative as listed in  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, of the person now deceased or of  any other deceased former holder of the call sign, provided that the  deceased former holder was a member of the club during his or her life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The vanity call sign requested by an applicant must be selected  from the group of call signs corresponding to the same or lower class of  operator license held by the applicant as designated in the sequential  call sign system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant must request that the call sign shown on the  license grant be vacated and provide a list of up to 25 call signs in  order of preference. In the event that the Commission receives more than  one application requesting a vanity call sign from an applicant on the  same receipt day, the Commission will process only the first such  application entered into the Universal Licensing System. Subsequent  vanity call sign applications from that applicant with the same receipt  date will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first assignable call sign from the applicant's list will be  shown on the license grant. When none of those call signs are  assignable, the call sign vacated by the applicant will be shown on the  license grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vanity call signs will be selected from those call signs  assignable at the time the application is processed by the FCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A call sign designated under the sequential call sign system for  Alaska, Hawaii, Caribbean Insular Areas, and Pacific Insular areas will  be assigned only to a primary or club station whose licensee's mailing  address is in the corresponding state, commonwealth, or island. This  limitation does not apply to an applicant for the call sign as the  spouse, child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent, stepparent,  brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or  in-law, of the former holder now deceased.
