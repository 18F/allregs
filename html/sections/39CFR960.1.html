                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called ``the Act'' in  this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses  to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain  administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before  the Postal Service. An eligible party may receive an award when it  prevails over the Postal Service, unless the Postal Service's position  was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award  unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards  and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for  awards, and the procedures and standards that the Postal Service will  use to make them.  [46 FR 45945, Sept. 16, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 6797, Mar. 5, 1987]</p>
