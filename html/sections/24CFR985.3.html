                            <p class="depth0">This section states the performance indicators that are used to assess PHA Section 8 management. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator in reviewing the accuracy of an PHA's annual SEMAP certification. HUD will prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA and will assign a rating for each indicator as shown. If the HUD verification method for the indicator relies on data in MTCS and HUD determines those data are insufficient to verify the PHA's certification on the indicator due to the PHA's failure to adequately report family data, HUD will assign a zero rating for the indicator. The method for selecting the PHA's quality control sample under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that the PHA's quality control sample was drawn in an unbiased manner.</p><p class="depth0">An PHA that expends less than $300,000 in Federal awards and whose Section 8 programs are not audited by

an independent auditor (IA), will not be rated under the SEMAP indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which the annual IA audit report is a HUD verification method. For those PHAs, the SEMAP score and overall performance rating will be determined based only on the remaining indicators in paragraphs (i) through (o) of this section as applicable. Although the SEMAP performance rating will not be determined using the indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, PHAs not subject to Federal audit requirements must still complete the SEMAP certification for these indicators and performance under the indicators is subject to HUD confirmatory reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Selection from the waiting list.

(24 CFR 982.405(a))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HUD verification method: MTCS report--Shows percent of HQS inspections that are more than 2 months overdue. The 2-month allowance is provided only to accommodate a possible lag in the PHA's electronic reporting of the annual HQS inspection on Form HUD-50058, and to allow the processing of the data into MTCS. The 2-month allowance provided here for rating purposes does not mean that any delay in completing annual HQS inspections is permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rating:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fewer than 5 percent of annual HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 10 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 5 to 10 percent of all annual HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 5 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> More than 10 percent of all annual HQS inspections of units under contract are more than 2 months overdue. 0 points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Lease-up. The provisions of this paragraph (n) apply to the first SEMAP certification due after July 2, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The indicator: This indicator shows whether the PHA enters into HAP contracts for the number of the PHA's baseline voucher units (units that are contracted under a Consolidated ACC) for the calendar year that ends on or before the PHA's fiscal year or whether the PHA has expended its allocated budget authority for the same calendar year. Allocated budget authority will be based upon the PHA's eligibility, which includes budget authority obligated for the calendar year and any portion of HAP reserves attributable to the budget authority that was offset from reserves during the calendar year. Litigation units and funding will be excluded from this indicator, and new increments will be excluded for 12 months from the effective date of the increment on the Consolidated ACC. Units assisted under the voucher homeownership option and units occupied under a project-based HAP contract are included in the measurement of this indicator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HUD verification method: This method is based on the percent of units leased under a tenant-based or project-based HAP contract or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA's fiscal year. The percent of units leased is determined by taking unit months leased under a HAP contract and unit months occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, as shown in HUD systems for the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year, and dividing that number by the number of unit months available for leasing based on the number of baseline units available at the beginning of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rating: (i) The percent of units leased or occupied by homeowners under the voucher homeownership option, or the percent of allocated budget authority expended during the calendar year that ends on or before the assessed PHA fiscal year was 98 percent or more.

The indicator consists of 2 components which show whether the PHA has enrolled families in the FSS program as required, and the extent of the PHA's progress in supporting FSS by measuring the percent of current FSS participants with FSS progress reports entered in MTCS that have had increases in earned income which resulted in escrow account balances.
