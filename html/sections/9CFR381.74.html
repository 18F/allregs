                                Sec. 381.74  Poultry suspected of having biological residues.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When any poultry at an official establishment is suspected of having  been treated with or exposed to any substance that may impart a  biological residue that would make their edible tissues adulterated,  they shall, at the option of the operator of the establishment, be  processed at the establishment and the carcasses and all parts thereof  retained under U.S. Retained tags, pending final disposition in  accordance with Sec. 381.80, of this part, and other provisions in  subpart K; or they shall be slaughtered at the establishment and buried  or incinerated in a manner satisfactory to the inspector. Alternatively,  such poultry may be returned to the grower, if further holding is likely  to result in their not being adulterated by reason of any residue. The  Inspection Service will notify the other Federal and State agencies  concerned of such action. To aid in determining the amount of residue  present in the poultry, officials of the Inspection Service may permit  the slaughter of any such poultry for the purpose of collecting tissues  for analysis of the residue. Such analysis may include the use of  inplant screening procedures designed to detect the presence of  antimicrobial residues in any species of poultry.  [47 FR 41336, Sept. 20, 1982]</p>
