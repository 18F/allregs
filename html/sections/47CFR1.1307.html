Applications to the Commission for construction permits, licenses to transmit or renewals thereof, equipment authorizations or modifications in existing facilities must contain a statement confirming compliance with the limits unless the facility, operation, or transmitter is categorically excluded, as discussed below. Technical information showing the basis for this statement must be submitted to the Commission upon request. Such compliance statements may be omitted from license applications for transceivers subject to the certification requirement in Sec. 25.129 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate exposure limits in Secs. 1.1310 and 2.1093 of this chapter are generally applicable to all facilities, operations and transmitters regulated by the Commission. However, a determination of compliance with the exposure limits in Sec. 1.1310 or Sec. 2.1093 of this chapter (routine environmental evaluation), and preparation of an EA if the limits are exceeded, is necessary only for facilities, operations and transmitters that fall into the categories listed in table 1, or those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All other facilities, operations and transmitters are categorically excluded from making such studies or preparing an EA, except as indicated in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For purposes of table 1, building-mounted antennas means antennas mounted in or on a building structure that is occupied as a workplace or residence. The term power in column 2 of table 1 refers to total operating power of the transmitting operation in question in terms of effective radiated power (ERP), equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), or peak envelope power (PEP), as defined in Sec. 2.1 of this chapter. For the case of the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, subpart H of part 22 of this chapter; the Personal Communications Service, part 24 of this chapter and the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, part 90 of this chapter, the phrase total power of all channels in column 2 of table 1

means the sum of the ERP or EIRP of all co-located simultaneously operating transmitters owned and operated by a single licensee. When applying the criteria of table 1, radiation in all directions should be considered. For the case of transmitting facilities using sectorized transmitting antennas, applicants and licensees should apply the criteria to all transmitting channels in a given sector, noting that for a highly directional antenna there is relatively little contribution to ERP or EIRP summation for other directions.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Transmitters, Facilities and Operations Subject to Routine</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Evaluation------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Service (title 47 CFR rule part)         Evaluation required if:------------------------------------------------------------------------Experimental Radio Services (part 5)...

Owners of transmitter sites are expected to allow applicants and licensees to take reasonable steps to comply with the requirements contained in Sec. 1.1307(b) and, where feasible, should encourage co-location of transmitters and common solutions for controlling access to areas where the RF exposure limits contained in Sec. 1.1310 might be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicants for proposed (not otherwise excluded) transmitters, facilities or modifications that would cause non-compliance with the limits specified in Sec. 1.1310 at an accessible area previously in compliance must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's transmitter or facility would result, at the area in question, in a power density that exceeds 5% of the power density exposure limit applicable to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength that, when squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic field strength limit applicable to that transmitter or facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Renewal applicants whose (not otherwise excluded) transmitters or facilities contribute to the field strength or power density at an accessible area not in compliance with the limits specified in Sec. 1.1310 must submit an EA if emissions from the applicant's transmitter or facility results, at the area in question, in a power density that exceeds 5% of the power density exposure limit applicable to that transmitter or facility or in a field strength that, when squared, exceeds 5% of the square of the electric or magnetic field strength limit applicable to that transmitter of facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If an interested person alleges that a particular action, otherwise categorically excluded, will have a significant environmental effect, the person shall submit to the Bureau responsible for processing that action a written petition setting forth in detail the reasons justifying or circumstances necessitating environmental consideration in the decision-making process. (See Sec. 1.1313). The Bureau shall review the petition and consider the environmental concerns that have been raised. If the Bureau determines that the action may have a significant environmental impact, the Bureau will require the applicant to prepare an EA (see Secs. 1.1308 and 1.1311), which will serve as the basis for the determination to proceed with or terminate environmental processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the Bureau responsible for processing a particular action, otherwise categorically excluded, determines that the proposal may have a significant environmental impact, the Bureau, on its own motion, shall require the applicant to submit an EA. The Bureau will review and consider the EA as in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Pending a final determination as to what, if any, permanent measures should be adopted specifically for the protection of migratory birds, the Bureau shall require an Environmental Assessment for an otherwise categorically excluded action involving a new or existing antenna structure, for which an antenna structure registration application (FCC Form 854) is required under part 17 of this chapter, if the proposed antenna structure will be over 450 feet in height above ground level (AGL) and involves either:</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction of a new antenna structure;</p><p class="depth0">2. Modification or replacement of an existing antenna structure involving a substantial increase in size as defined in paragraph

I(C)(1)(3) of Appendix B to part 1 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0">3. Addition of lighting or adoption of a less preferred lighting style as defined in Sec. 17.4(c)(1)(iii) of this chapter. The Bureau shall consider whether to require an EA for other antenna structures subject to Sec. 17.4(c) of this chapter in accordance with Sec. 17.4(c)(8) of this chapter. An Environmental Assessment required pursuant to this note will be subject to the same procedures that apply to any Environmental Assessment required for a proposed tower or modification of an existing tower for which an antenna structure registration application (FCC Form 854) is required, as set forth in Sec. 17.4(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the regulations contained in this chapter concerning the environmental effects of such emissions. For purposes of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term personal wireless service means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term personal wireless service facilities means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term unlicensed wireless services means the offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term direct-to-home satellite services means the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber's premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the subscriber's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite.
