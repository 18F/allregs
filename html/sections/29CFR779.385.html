                            <p class="depth0">An amusement or recreational establishment operating on a seasonal basis may qualify as an exempt establishment under section 13(a)(3) of the Act, added by the 1966 amendments, even if it does not meet all the requirements of the 13(a)(2) exemption. Section 13(a)(3) exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of the Act ``any employee employed by an establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment, if (a) it does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year or (b) during the preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any 6 months of the year were not more than 33\1/3\ percentum of its average receipts for the other 6 months of such year''. ``Amusement or recreational establishments'' as used in section 13(a)(3) are establishments frequented by the public for its amusement or recreation and which are open for 7 months or less a year or which meet the seasonal receipts test provided in clause (B) of the exemption. Typical examples of such are the concessionaires at amusement parks and beaches. (S. Rept. 145, 87th Cong., first session, p. 28; H. Rept. 75, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 10.)</p><p class="depth0">Restaurants and Establishments Providing Food And Beverage Service</p>
