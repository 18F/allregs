This authority may be used where there is doubt or a dispute regarding the applicability of an ethics provision or where the Director has information indicating that an ethics provision is being improperly interpreted. Recommendations may be made or advice provided on the Director's own initiative or at the Director's discretion in response to a written or oral request. As determined by the Director, the recommendation may be made or the advice given either orally or in writing. In addition, the Director shall afford an employee the opportunity for personal consultation, if practicable, regarding action required to be taken by the employee to achieve compliance with applicable ethics provisions.</p>
