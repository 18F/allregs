                            <p class="depth0">An SMR license initially authorized on any of the channels listed in  Tables 4 and 5 of Sec. 90.617 may transfer or assign its channel(s) to  another entity subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.948 of this chapter  and Sec. 90.609(b). If the proposed transferee or assignee is the EA  licensee for the spectrum block to which the channel is allocated, such  transfer or assignment presumptively will be deemed to be in the public  interest. However, such presumption will be rebuttable.  [69 FR 67852, Nov. 22, 2004]</p>
