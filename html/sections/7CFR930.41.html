                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An assessment may be levied upon handlers annually under this  part to cover the administrative costs of the Board, costs of  inspection, and any research, development and promotion activities  initiated by the Board under Sec. 930.48.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each part of an assessment intended to cover the costs of each  activity in paragraph (a) of this section, must be identified and  approved by the Board and the Secretary, and any notification or other  statement regarding assessments provided to handlers must contain such  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a pro rata share of the administrative, inspection, research,  development, and promotion expenses which the Secretary finds reasonable  and likely to be incurred by the Board during a fiscal period, each  handler shall pay to the Board assessments on all cherries handled, as  the handler thereof, during such period: Provided, a handler shall be  exempt from any assessment only on the tonnage of handled   cherries that either are diverted by destruction at the handler's  facilities according to Sec. 930.59 or are cherries represented by  grower diversion certificates issued pursuant to Sec. 930.58(b) and  acquired by handlers as described in Sec. 930.59.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the  Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler  during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient  funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred during  such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary  may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds  to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses  which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries  handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds  for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first  part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available  from assessments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in  advance, and may borrow money for such purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Assessments not paid within a time prescribed by the Board may  be made subject to interest or late payment charges, or both. The period  of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge will be as  recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary: Provided, That  when interest or late payment charges are in effect, they shall be  applied to all assessments not paid within the prescribed period of  time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Assessments shall be calculated on the basis of pounds of  cherries handled. The established assessment rate may be uniform, or may  vary dependent on the product the cherries are used to manufacture. In  recommending annual assessment rates, the Board shall consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The differences in the number of pounds of cherries utilized for  various cherry products; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relative market values of such cherry products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish  rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of  this section.
