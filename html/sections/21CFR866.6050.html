                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An ovarian/adnexal mass assessment test system  is a device that measures one or more proteins in serum or plasma. It  yields a single result for the likelihood that an adnexal pelvic mass in  a woman, for whom surgery is planned, is malignant. The test is for  adjunctive use, in the context of a negative primary clinical and  radiological evaluation, to augment the identification of patients whose  gynecologic surgery requires oncology expertise and resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special control  for this device is FDA's guidance document entitled ``Class II Special  Controls Guidance Document: Ovarian Adnexal Mass Assessment Score Test  System.'' For the availability of this guidance document, see Sec.  866.1(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Black box warning. Under section 520(e) of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act these devices are subject to the following  restriction: A warning statement must be placed in a black box and must  appear in all advertising, labeling, and promotional material for these  devices.
