Markings other than ``Top  Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential,'' such as ``For Official Use  Only,'' shall not be used to identify national security information. In  addition, no other term or phrase shall be used in conjunction with one  of the three authorized classification levels, such as ``Secret  Sensitive'' or ``Agency Confidential.'' The terms ``Top Secret'',  ``Secret'', and ``Confidential'' should not be used to identify  nonclassified executive branch information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher  than is necessary shall be scrupulously avoided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify  information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified  ``Confidential'' pending a determination by an original classification  authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. If  there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification  the originator of the information shall safeguard it at the higher level  of classification pending a determination by an original classification  authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days.  Upon the determination of a need for classification and/or the proper  classification level, the information that is classified shall be marked  as provided in Sec. 2400.12 of this part.</p>
