Records specified in this section may be disposed of after a period of 3 years from the date of the official service; provided, the 3-year period may be extended if the elevator owner or operator, or merchandiser is notified in writing by the Administrator that specific records should be retained for a longer period for effective administration and enforcement of the Act.
