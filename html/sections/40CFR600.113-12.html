                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator will use the calculation procedure set forth in this paragraph for all official EPA testing of vehicles fueled with gasoline, diesel, alcohol-based or natural gas fuel. The calculations of the weighted fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values require input of the weighted grams/mile values for total hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2); and, additionally for methanol-fueled automobiles, methanol (CH3OH) and formaldehyde (HCHO); and, additionally for ethanol-fueled automobiles, methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetaldehyde (C2H4O), and formaldehyde (HCHO); and additionally for natural gas-fueled vehicles, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and methane (CH4). For manufacturers selecting the fleet averaging option for N2O and CH4 as allowed under Sec. 86.1818 of this chapter the calculations of the carbon-related exhaust emissions require the input of grams/mile values for nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Emissions shall be determined for the FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and cold temperature FTP tests. Additionally, the specific gravity, carbon weight fraction and net heating value of the test fuel must be determined. The FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and cold temperature FTP fuel economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values shall be calculated as specified in this section. An

example fuel economy calculation appears in Appendix II of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculate the FTP fuel economy as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the weighted grams/mile values for the FTP test for CO2, HC, and CO, and where applicable, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H4O, HCHO, NMHC, N2O and CH4 as specified in Sec. 86.144-94(b) of this chapter. Measure and record the test fuel's properties as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculate separately the grams/mile values for the cold transient phase, stabilized phase and hot transient phase of the FTP test. For vehicles with more than one source of propulsion energy, one of which is a rechargeable energy storage system, or vehicles with special features that the Administrator determines may have a rechargeable energy source, whose charge can vary during the test, calculate separately the grams/mile values for the cold transient phase, stabilized phase, hot transient phase and hot stabilized phase of the FTP test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculate the HFET fuel economy as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the mass values for the highway fuel economy test for HC, CO and CO2, and where applicable, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H4O, HCHO, NMHC, N2O and CH4 as specified in Sec. 86.144-94(b) of this chapter.

In lieu of directly measuring the emissions of the separate city and highway phases of the US06 test according to the provisions of Sec. 86.159 of this chapter, the manufacturer may, with the advance approval of the Administrator and using good engineering judgment, optionally analytically determine the grams/mile values for the city and highway phases of the US06 test. To analytically determine US06 City and US06 Highway phase emission results, the manufacturer shall multiply the US06 total grams/mile values determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section by the estimated proportion of fuel use for the city and highway phases relative to the total US06 fuel use. The manufacturer may estimate the proportion of fuel use for the US06 City and US06 Highway phases by using modal CO2, HC, and CO emissions data, or by using appropriate OBD data (e.g., fuel flow rate in grams of fuel per second), or another method approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Measure and record the test fuel's properties as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculate the SC03 fuel economy as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the grams/mile values for the SC03 test for HC, CO and CO2, and where applicable, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H4O, HCHO, NMHC, N2O and CH4 as specified in Sec. 86.144-94(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Measure and record the test fuel's properties as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Analyze and determine fuel properties as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline test fuel properties shall be determined by analysis of a fuel sample taken from the fuel supply.
