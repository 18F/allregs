Immediately following this statement, the manufacturer shall include the list developed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any act included in the list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is presumed to constitute tampering; however, in any case in which a proscribed act has been committed and it can be shown that such act resulted in no increase in the sound level of the compressor or that the compressor still meets the noise emission standard of Sec. 204.52, such set will not constitute tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this section are not intended to preclude any State or local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing its own prohibitions against the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control systems on compressors subject to this part.
