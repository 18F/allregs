Only historically Black colleges and universities (as determined by the Department of Education in accordance with that Department's responsibilities under Executive Order 12677, dated April 28, 1989) are eligible to submit applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible activities. Activities that may be funded under this section are those eligible under Sec.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. Sec.  570.200(g), grants under this section

are not subject to the 20 percent limitation on planning and program administration costs, as defined in Sec. Sec.  570.205 and 570.206, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications. Applications will only be accepted from eligible applicants in response to a Request for Applications (RFA) which will be issued either concurrently with or after the publication of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the Federal Register. The NOFA will describe any special objectives sought to be achieved by the funding to be provided, including any limitations on the type of activities to be funded to achieve the objectives, points to be awarded to each of the selection criteria listed in paragraph (e) of this section, and any special factors to be evaluated in assigning points under the selection factors to achieve the stated objectives. The NOFA will also state the deadline for the submission of applications, the total funding available for the competition, and the maximum amount of individual grants. The NOFA will include further information and instructions for the submission of acceptable applications to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Selection criteria.

(1) Certifications required to be submitted by applicants shall be as prescribed in the RFA packages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifications required to be submitted by applicants shall be as prescribed in the RFA packages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the absence of independent evidence which tends to challenge in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant, the required certifications will be accepted by HUD. If independent evidence is available to HUD, however, HUD may require further information or assurances to be submitted in order to determine whether the applicant's certifications are satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Multiyear funding commitments. (1) HUD may make funding commitments of up to five years, subject to the availability of appropriations. In determining the number of years for which a commitment will be made, HUD will consider the nature of the activities proposed, the capability of the recipient to carry out the proposed activities, and year-by-year funding requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD may make funding commitments of up to five years, subject to the availability of appropriations. In determining the number of years for which a commitment will be made, HUD will consider the nature of the activities proposed, the capability of the recipient to carry out the proposed activities, and year-by-year funding requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Awards will be made on the basis of a 12-month period of performance. Once a recipient has been selected for a multi-year award, that recipient would not be required to compete in a competition for the subsequent funding years covered by the multi-year funding commitment. Recipients performing satisfactorily will be invited to submit applications for subsequent funding years in accordance with requirements outlined in the Notice of Funding Availability and Request for Grant Application. Subject to the availability of appropriations, subsequent-year funding will be determined by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recipient has submitted all reports required for the previous year or years in a timely, complete and satisfactory manner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recipient has submitted sufficient evidence to demonstrate successful completion of the tasks and deliverables of the grant. A determination of satisfactory performance will be made by HUD based upon evidence of task completions provided by the recipient, along with data from client feedback and site evaluations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The recipient has submitted the next annual application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The subsequent year's application is consistent with that described in the original application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recipients participating in multi-year funding projects are not eligible to apply for additional grants for the same project or activity subject area for which they are receiving funds.
