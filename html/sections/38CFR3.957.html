                            <p class="depth0">Service connection for any disability or death granted or continued  under title 38 U.S.C., which has been in effect for 10 or more years  will not be severed except upon a showing that the original grant was  based on fraud or it is clearly shown from military records that the  person concerned did not have the requisite service or character of  discharge. The 10-year period will be computed from the effective date  of the Department of Veterans Affairs finding of service connection to  the effective date of the rating decision severing service connection,  after compliance with Sec.  3.105(d). The protection afforded in this  section extends to claims for dependency and indemnity compensation or  death compensation.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1159)  [33 FR 15286, Oct. 15, 1968]</p>
