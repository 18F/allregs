                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability. We will provide you with an opportunity for a  disability hearing if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You have been receiving benefits based on a medical impairment  that renders you disabled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We have made an initial or revised determination based on  medical factors that you are not now disabled because your impairment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has ceased;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Did not exist; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is no longer disabling; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You make a timely request for reconsideration of the initial or  revised determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The disability hearing will address only the initial or  revised determination, based on medical factors, that you are not now  disabled. Any other issues which arise in connection with your request  for reconsideration will be reviewed in accordance with the  reconsideration procedures described in Sec. 404.913(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time and place--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Either the State agency or the  Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her  delegate, as appropriate, will set the time and place of your disability  hearing. We will send you a notice of the time and place of your  disability hearing at least 20 days before the date of the hearing. You  may be expected to travel to your disability hearing. (See  Secs. 404.999a-404.999d regarding reimbursement for travel expenses.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change of time or place. If you are unable to travel or have  some other reason why you cannot attend your disability hearing at the  scheduled time or place, you should request at the earliest possible  date that the time or place of your hearing be changed. We will change  the time or place if there is good cause for doing so under the  standards in Sec. 404.936 (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Combined issues. If a disability hearing is available to you  under paragraph (a) of this section, and you file a new application for  benefits while your request for reconsideration is still pending, we may  combine the issues on both claims for the purpose of the disability  hearing and issue a combined initial/reconsidered determination which is  binding with respect to the common issues on both claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definition. For purposes of the provisions regarding disability  hearings (Secs. 404.914 through 404.918) we, us or our means the Social  Security Administration or the State agency.
