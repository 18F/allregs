                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where used, tank insulation shall satisfy the following  requirements for combustibility, installation, and arrangement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insulation in a location exposed to possible high temperature or  source of ignition shall be either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incombustible, complying with the requirements of subpart  164.009 of subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Self-extinguishing, as determined by ASTM D 4986, ``Standard  Test Method for Horizontal Burning Characteristics of Cellular Polymeric  Materials,'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 38.01-3) and covered  by a suitable steel cover.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insulation in a location protected against possible ignition by  enclosure in a tight steel envelope in which inert conditions are  maintained need satisfy no requirement for combustibility except  chemical stability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insulation in a location protected against possible high  temperature or   source of ignition by continuous surrounding structural voids or ballast  tanks need satisfy no requirement for combustibility except chemical  stability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All insulation shall be of a vapor-proof construction, or have a  vapor-proof coating of a fire-retardant material acceptable to the  Commandant. Unless the vapor barrier is inherently weather resistant,  tanks exposed to the weather shall be fitted with a removable sheet  metal jacket of not less than 0.083-inch thick over the vapor-proof  coating and flashed around all openings so as to be weathertight.  Weather resistant coatings shall have sheet metal over areas subject to  mechanical damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The insulation shall be adequately protected in areas of  probable mechanical damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insulation which forms an integral part of the secondary barrier  shall meet the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the secondary barrier is called upon to contain the cargo,  insulating material which is contacted shall not be affected by the  cargo. Samples of the insulating material shall be tested in the cargo  for solubility, absorption and shrinkage. The samples shall be checked  for the above effects at intervals not exceeding 1 week, for a total  test period of 6 weeks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any adhesives, sealers, coatings, or vapor barrier compounds  used in conjunction with the insulating material shall be similarly  tested to insure suitable cargo resistive properties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The insulation shall have sufficient mechanical strength for the  proposed design. Additionally, the thermal expansion of the insulation  relative to the material to which it is affixed shall be considered in  the design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The insulation for the piping systems shall be at least of the  ``self-extinguishing'' type described in paragraph (a) of this section,  and comply with the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section.
