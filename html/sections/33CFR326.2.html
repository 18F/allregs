                            <p class="depth0">Enforcement, as part of the overall regulatory program of the Corps, is based on a policy of regulating the waters of the United States by discouraging activities that have not been properly authorized and by requiring corrective measures, where appropriate, to ensure those waters are not misused and to maintain the integrity of the program. There are several methods discussed in the remainder of

this part which can be used either singly or in combination to implement this policy, while making the most effective use of the enforcement resources available. As EPA has independent enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act for unauthorized discharges, the district engineer should normally coordinate with EPA to determine the most effective and efficient manner by which resolution of a section 404 violation can be achieved.</p>
