                            <p class="depth0">Power cables energized to potentials in excess of 150 volts, phase- to-ground, shall not be moved with equipment unless sleds or slings,  insulated from such equipment, are used. When such energized cables are  moved manually, insulated hooks, tongs, ropes, or slings shall be used  unless suitable protection for persons is provided by other means. This  does not prohibit pulling or dragging of cable by the equipment it  powers when the cable is physically attached to the equipment by  suitable mechanical devices, and the cable is insulated from the  equipment in conformance with other standards in this part.</p>
