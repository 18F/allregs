                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. No later than August 2, 2011 the operator of a master meter system or a small LPG operator must develop and implement an IM program that includes a written IM plan as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The IM program for these pipelines should reflect the relative simplicity of these types of pipelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Elements. A written integrity management plan must address, at a minimum, the following elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Knowledge. The operator must demonstrate knowledge of its pipeline, which, to the extent known, should include the approximate location and material of its pipeline. The operator must identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining knowledge over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identify threats. The operator must consider, at minimum, the following categories of threats (existing and potential): Corrosion, natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rank risks. The operator must evaluate the risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance of each identified threat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Identify and implement measures to mitigate risks. The operator must determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness. The operator must monitor, as a performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their causes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Periodic evaluation and improvement. The operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting IM program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must re-evaluate its entire program at least every five years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Records. The operator must maintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A written IM plan in accordance with this section, including superseded IM plans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Documents supporting threat identification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Documents showing the location and material of all piping and appurtenances that are installed after the effective date of the operator's IM program and, to the extent known, the location and material of all pipe and appurtenances that were existing on the effective date of the operator's program.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.</p><p class="depth0">A. Bending Properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without opening the longitudinal weld.</p><p class="depth0">For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM A53/A53M (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), except that the number of tests must be at least equal to the minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to determine yield strength.</p><p class="depth0">B. Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in accordance with API Standard 1104 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7). If the requirements of API Standard 1104 cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical tests for carbon and manganese, and proceeding in accordance with section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ibr, see 192.7). The same number of chemical tests must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.</p><p class="depth0">C. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.</p><p class="depth0">D. Tensile Properties. If the tensile properties of the pipe are not known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7). All test specimens shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be performed:</p><p class="depth0">Number of Tensile Tests--All Sizes------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------10 lengths or less........................  1 set of tests for each</p><p class="depth0">length.11 to 100 lengths.........................  1 set of tests for each 5</p><p class="depth0">lengths, but not less than</p><p class="depth0">10 tests.Over 100 lengths..........................  1 set of tests for each 10</p><p class="depth0">lengths, but not less than</p><p class="depth0">20 tests.------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the yield-tensile ratio, based on the properties determined by those tests, exceeds 0.85, the pipe may be used only as provided in Sec. 192.55(c).</p><p class="depth0">III. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use under this part if the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0">A. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It

must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.</p><p class="depth0">B. Similarity of specification requirements. The edition of the listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to the following properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I of this appendix:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing requirements to verify those properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify those properties.</p><p class="depth0">C. Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with welded seams, one of the following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the specification listed in section I of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be maintained for at least 8 hours.

Appendix C to Part 192--Qualification of Welders for Low Stress</p><p class="depth0">Level Pipe</p><p class="depth0">I. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more than \1/8\-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during testing are not considered. A welder who successfully passes a butt-weld qualification test under this section shall be qualified to weld on all pipe diameters less than or equal to 12 inches.</p><p class="depth0">II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to mains. A service line connection fitting is welded to a pipe section with the same diameter as a typical main. The weld is made in the same position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. The weld is tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.</p><p class="depth0">III. Periodic tests for welders of small service lines. Two samples of the welder's work, each about 8 inches (203 millimeters) long with the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service line and tested as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent to the contour of the die for a distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on each side of the weld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after removal from the bending machine, it is unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to or in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending test prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

Appendix D to Part 192--Criteria for Cathodic Protection and</p><p class="depth0">Determination of Measurements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell. Determination of this voltage must be made with the protective current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this appendix. This criterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in contact with metals of different anodic potentials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally established at the beginning of the Tafel segment of the E-log-I curve. This voltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) voltage shift of 150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current.

This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically protected at voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a copper-copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this appendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH conditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to increase the pH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack on aluminum structures in environments with a natural pH in excess of 8.</p><p class="depth0">C. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">D. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic) voltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix, equal to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be maintained. If amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged by high alkalinity covered by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of this section, they must be electrically isolated with insulating flanges, or the equivalent.</p><p class="depth0">II. Interpretation of voltage measurement. Voltage (IR) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary must be considered for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) and (2) and paragraph B(1) of section I of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">III. Determination of polarization voltage shift. The polarization voltage shift must be determined by interrupting the protective current and measuring the polarization decay. When the current is initially interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. The voltage reading after the immediate shift must be used as the base reading from which to measure polarization decay in paragraphs A(3), B(2), and C of section I of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Reference half cells. A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell contacting the electrolyte.</p><p class="depth0">B. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the saturated cooper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference half cells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to -0.85 volt as referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Saturated KCl calomel half cell: -0.78 volt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: -0.80 volt.</p><p class="depth0">C. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate metallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured and if its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell is established.
