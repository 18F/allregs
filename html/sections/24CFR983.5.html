                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How PBV works. (1) The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under an annual contributions contract (ACC) with HUD. In the PBV program, the assistance is ``attached to the structure.'' (See description of the difference between ``project-based'' and ``tenant-based'' rental assistance at 24 CFR 982.1(b).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under an annual contributions contract (ACC) with HUD.

In the Agreement, the PHA agrees to execute a HAP contract after the owner completes the construction or rehabilitation of the units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA makes housing assistance payments to the owner for units leased and occupied by eligible families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How PBV is funded. (1) If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC. This pool of funding is used to pay housing assistance for both tenant-based and project-based voucher units and to pay PHA administrative fees for administration of tenant-based and project-based voucher assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC.

HUD does not reserve additional units for project-based vouchers and does not provide any additional funding for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> PHA discretion to operate PBV program. A PHA has discretion whether to operate a PBV program. HUD approval is not required, except that the PHA must notify HUD of its intent to

project-base its vouchers, in accordance with Sec. 983.6(d).
