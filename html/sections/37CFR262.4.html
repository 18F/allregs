The Designated Agents also shall agree to a corresponding methodology for allocating royalty payments between them using the information provided by the Licensee pursuant to the regulations governing records of use of performances for the period for which the royalty payment was made. Such methodology shall value all performances equally. Within 30 days after their agreement concerning such responsibility and methodology, the Designated Agents shall inform the Register of Copyrights thereof.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to any royalty payment received by the Receiving Agent from a Licensee, a designation by a Copyright Owner or Performer of a Designated Agent must be made no later than 30 days prior to the receipt by the Receiving Agent of that royalty payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Receiving Agent shall promptly allocate the royalty payments it receives between the two Designated Agents in accordance with the agreed methodology. A final adjustment, if necessary, shall be agreed and paid or refunded, as the case may be, between the Receiving Agent and the collectives named under paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each calendar year no later than 180 days following the end of each calendar year. The Designated Agents shall agree on a reasonable basis for the sharing on a pro-rata basis of any costs associated with the allocations set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If a Designated Agent is unable to locate a Copyright Owner or Performer that the Designated Agent otherwise would be required to pay under this paragraph (b) within 3 years from the date of payment by Licensee, such Copyright Owner's or Performer's share of the payments made by Licensees may first be applied to the costs directly attributable to the administration of the royalty payments due such Copyright Owners and Performers by that Designated Agent and shall thereafter be allocated between the Designated Agents on a pro rata basis (based on distributions to entitled parties) to offset any costs permitted to be deducted by a designated agent under 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(3). The foregoing shall apply notwithstanding the common law or statutes of any State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monthly payments.

The agent shall distribute royalty payments on a basis that values all performances by a Licensee equally based upon the information provided by the Licensee pursuant to the regulations governing records of use of sound recordings by Licensees; Provided, however, Performers and Copyright Owners that authorize the Designated Agent may agree with the Designated Agent to allocate their shares of the royalty payments made by any Licensee among themselves on an alternative basis. Parties entitled to receive payments under 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2) may agree with the Designated Agent upon payment protocols to be used by the Designated Agent that provide for alternative arrangements for the payment of royalties consistent with the percentages in 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Designated Agent shall distribute royalty payments directly to Copyright Owners and Performers, according to 17 U.S.C. 114(g)(2); Provided that the Designated Agent shall only be responsible for making distributions to those Copyright Owners and Performers who provide the Designated Agent with such information as is necessary to identify and pay the correct recipient of such payments.
