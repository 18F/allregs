                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of application. An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identity of the applicant and the proceeding for which the award is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A showing that the applicant has prevailed; or, if the applicant has not prevailed, a showing that the Commission's demand was the final demand before initiation of the adversary adjudication and that it was substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer and was unreasonable when compared with that decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of the Commission position(s) that applicant alleges was (were) not substantially justified; or, identification of the Commission's demand that is alleged to be excessive and unreasonable and an explanation as to why the demand was excessive and unreasonable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A brief description of the type and purpose of the organization or business (unless the applicant is an individual);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement of how the applicant meets the criteria of Sec. 3.81(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The amount of fees and expenses incurred after the initiation of the adjudicative proceeding or, in the case of a claim for defending against an excessive demand, the amount of fees and expenses incurred after the initiation of the adjudicative proceeding attributable to the excessive portion of the demand;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any other matters the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A written verification under oath or under penalty or perjury that the information provided is true and correct accompanied by the signature of the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Net worth exhibit. (1) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the application and any affiliates (as defined in Sec. 3.81(d)(6)) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Administrative Law Judge may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the application and any affiliates (as defined in Sec. 3.81(d)(6)) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Administrative Law Judge may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, if an applicant objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure, the applicant may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the Administrative Law Judge in a sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on complaint counsel but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the Administrative Law Judge finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 4.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documentation of fees and expenses. The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses incurred after initiation of the adversary adjudication, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. With respect to a claim for fees and expenses involving an excessive demand, the application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses incurred after initiation of the adversary adjudication, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought attributable to the portion of the demand alleged to be excessive and unreasonable. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The Administrative Law Judge may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an application may be filed--(1) For a prevailing party:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a prevailing party:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An application may be filed not later than 30 days after the Commission has issued an order or otherwise taken action that results in final disposition of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a party defending against an excessive demand:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An application may be filed not later than 30 days after the Commission has issued an order or otherwise taken action that results in final disposition of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes the agency's demand was excessive and unreasonable, proceedings for the award of fees and expenses shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this subpart, final disposition means the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date that the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge becomes the decision of the Commission pursuant to Sec. 3.51(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date that the Commission issues an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of the Commission's final order in the proceeding; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date that the Commission issues a final order or any other final resolution of a proceeding, such as a consent agreement, settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not subject to a petition for reconsideration.</p>
