                            <p class="depth0">The NDC processes referrals of both Federal records and Presidential  records. Referrals identified in accessioned Federal records will be  processed by the Interagency Referral Center (IRC); referrals identified  in records maintained by the Presidential Libraries will be processed by  the Remote Archives Capture (RAC) Project. (The RAC Project is a  collaborative program to facilitate the declassification review of  classified records in the Presidential Libraries in accordance with  section 3.3 of the Order. In this project, classified Presidential  records at the various Presidential Libraries are scanned and brought to  the Washington, DC, metropolitan area in electronic form for review by  equity-holding agencies.)</p>
