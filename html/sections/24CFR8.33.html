The  recipient may not impose upon individuals with handicaps other policies,  such as the prohibition of assistive devices, auxiliary alarms, or  guides in housing facilities, that have the effect of limiting the  participation of tenants with handicaps in the recipient's federally  assisted housing program or activity in violation of this part. Housing  policies that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the housing  program or activity will not be regarded as discriminatory within the  meaning of this section if modifications to them would result in a  fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or undue  financial and administrative burdens.</p>
