                            <p class="depth0">To understand the meaning of ``production'' of goods for commerce as used in the Act it is necessary to refer to the definition in section 3(j) of the term ``produced.'' A detailed discussion of the application of the term as defined is contained in the interpretative bulletin on general coverage of the Act, part 776 of this chapter. Section 3(j) provides that ``produced'' as used in the Act ``means produced, manufactured, mined, handled, or in any other manner worked on in any State; and for the purposes of this Act an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any closely related process or occupation directly essential to the production thereof, in any State.'' (For the definition of ``State,'' see Sec. 779.16.)</p>
