                                Sec. 306.37  Interest on registered securities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method of payment. The interest on registered securities is  payable by checks drawn on the United States Treasury to the order of  the registered owners, except as otherwise provided herein. Interest  checks are prepared by the Department in advance of the interest payment  data and are ordinarily mailed in time to reach the addresses on that  date. Interest on a registered security which has not matured or been  called and which is presented for any transaction during the period the  books for that loan are closed will be paid by check drawn to the order  of the registered owner of record. Upon receipt of notice of the death  or incompetency of an individual named as registered owner, a change in  the name or   in the status of a partnership, corporation, or unincorporated  association, the removal, resignation, succession, or death of a  fiduciary or trustee, delivery of interest checks will be withheld  pending receipt and approval of evidence showing who is entitled to  receive the interest checks. If the inscriptions on securities do not  clearly identify the owners, delivery of interest checks will be  withheld pending reissue of the securities in the correct registration.  The final installment of interest, unless otherwise provided in the  offering circular or notice of call, will be paid by check drawn to the  order of the registered owner of record and mailed in advance of the  interest payment date in time to reach the addressee on or about that  date. Interest on securities presented for prerefunding or advance  refunding will be adjusted as provided in the prerefunding or advance  refunding offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of address. To assure timely delivery of interest checks,  owners should promptly notify the Bureau of any change of address. (Form  PD 345 may be used.) The notification must be signed by the registered  owner or a joint owner or an authorized representative, and should show  the owner's taxpayer identifying number, the old and new addresses, the  serial number and denomination of each security, the titles of the  securities (for example: 4\1/4\ percent Treasury Bonds of 1987-92, dated  August 15, 1962), and the registration of each security. Notifications  by attorneys in fact, trustees, or by the legal representatives of the  estates of deceased, incompetent, or minor owners should be supported by  proof of their authority, unless, in the case of trustees or legal  representatives, they are named in the registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection of interest checks--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Interest checks may  be collected in accordance with the regulations governing the  endorsement and payment of Government warrants and checks, which are  contained in the current revision of Department Circular No. 21 (part  240 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By voluntary guardians of incompetents. Interest checks drawn to  the order of a person who has become incompetent and for whose estate no  legal guardian or similar representative has been appointed should be  returned to the Bureau with a full explanation of the circumstances. For  collection of interest, the Department will recognize the relative  responsible for the incompetent's care and support or some other person  as voluntary guardian for the incompetent. (Application may be made on  Form PD 1461.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nonreceipt, loss, theft, or destruction of interest checks. If  an interest check is not received within a reasonable period after an  interest payment date, or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed after  receipt, notification should be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal  Service, Division of Customer Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102.  Notification should include the name and address of the owner, his  taxpayer identifying number, and the serial number, denomination, and  title of the security upon which the interest was payable. If the check  is subsequently received or recovered, the Bureau should be notified.  [38 FR 7078, Mar. 15, 1973, as amended at 64 FR 38126, July 15, 1999]</p>
