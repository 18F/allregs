                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information covered. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information classified under the Order or predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the originating agency if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request for a review describes the document or material containing

the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate it in a reasonably timely manner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The document or material containing the information responsive to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance with law; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The information is not the subject of pending litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presidential papers. Information originated by the President or Vice President; the President's White House Staff, or the Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the President are exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203. Procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a decision on the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of requests for review. Requests for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests originating within NASA shall, in all cases, be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the most expeditious action, requests from other Governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services only. The requestor may submit the request to: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Central Registry, 300 E Street SW., Washington DC 20546, Attention: Office of Protective Services/Information Security Program Manager. The phrase, ``Mandatory Declassification Review,'' must be stated in the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirement for processing. (1) Requests which are submitted under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be processed under the MDR process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests which are submitted under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be processed under the MDR process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity, such as accession numbers, box titles or numbers, date and title of document, in any combination, to enable NASA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort, not to exceed 30 days. If more time is required, NASA will notify the requester. After review, the information or any portion thereof that no longer requires protection shall be declassified and released unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Processing of requests. Requests that meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be processed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NASA Office of Protective Services review upon receiving the initial request shall be completed within 365 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged promptly. The NASA Office of Protective Services shall determine whether, under the declassification provisions of this part 1203, the requested information may be declassified and, if so, shall make such information available to the requestor, unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the requestor shall be given a brief statement of the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in order to be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All appeals of denials of requests for declassification shall be acted upon and determined finally within 120 working days after receipt, and the requester shall be advised that the appeal

determination is final. If the requester is dissatisfied with NASA's appeal decision, the requester may initiate an appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP), within the Information Security Oversight Office. If continued classification is required under the provisions of this part 1203, the requester shall be notified of the reasons thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The declassification and release of foreign government information that is subjected to mandatory review under this section shall be determined only in accordance with Sec. 1203.703.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the NASA Office of Protective Services receives any request for declassification of information in documents in its custody that was classified by another Government agency, it shall refer copies of the request and the requested documents to the originating agency for processing and may, after consultation with the originating agency, inform the requester of the referral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Neutral response. In response to a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of ``the Order,'' NASA shall refuse to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself classifiable under ``the Order.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Declassification of transferred documents or material--(1) Material officially transferred. In the case of classified information or material transferred by or pursuant to statute or Executive Order to NASA in conjunction with a transfer of functions (not merely for storage purposes) for NASA's use and as part of its official files or property, as distinguished from transfers merely for purposes of storage, NASA shall be deemed to be the original classifying authority over such material for purposes of downgrading and declassification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material officially transferred. In the case of classified information or material transferred by or pursuant to statute or Executive Order to NASA in conjunction with a transfer of functions (not merely for storage purposes) for NASA's use and as part of its official files or property, as distinguished from transfers merely for purposes of storage, NASA shall be deemed to be the original classifying authority over such material for purposes of downgrading and declassification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Material not officially transferred. When NASA has in its possession classified information or material originated by an agency which has since ceased to exist and that information has not been officially transferred to another department or agency or when it is impossible for NASA to identify the originating agency and a review of the material indicates that it should be downgraded or declassified, NASA shall be deemed to be the originating agency for the purpose of declassifying or downgrading such material. NASA will consult with the Information Security Oversight Office to assist in final disposition of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfer for storage or retirement. (i) Insofar as practicable, classified documents shall be reviewed to determine whether or not they can be downgraded or declassified prior to being forwarded to records centers or to the National Archives for storage. Any downgrading or declassification determination shall be indicated on each document by appropriate markings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Insofar as practicable, classified documents shall be reviewed to determine whether or not they can be downgraded or declassified prior to being forwarded to records centers or to the National Archives for storage. Any downgrading or declassification determination shall be indicated on each document by appropriate markings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Classified information transferred to the General Services Administration for accession into the Archives of the United States shall be downgraded or declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with ``the Order,'' the directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, GSA, and NASA guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Downgrading and declassification actions--(1) Notification of changes in classification or declassification. When classified material has been marked with specific dates or events for downgrading or declassification, it is not necessary to issue notices of such actions to any holders. However, when such actions are taken earlier than originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is shortened, the authority making such changes shall, to the extent practicable, ensure prompt notification to all addressees to whom the information or material was originally transmitted. The notification shall specify the marking action to be taken, the authority therefor, and the effective date. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall effect the proper changes and shall notify addressees to whom they have transmitted the classified information or material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification of changes in classification or declassification. When classified material has been marked with specific dates or events for downgrading or declassification, it is not necessary to issue notices of such actions to any holders. However, when such actions are taken earlier than originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is shortened, the authority making such changes shall, to the extent practicable, ensure prompt notification to all addressees to whom the information or material was originally transmitted. The notification shall specify the marking action to be taken, the authority therefor, and the effective date. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall effect the proper changes and shall notify addressees to whom they have transmitted the classified information or material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Posted notice. If prompt remarking of large quantities would be unduly burdensome, the custodian may attach declassification, downgrading, or upgrading notices to the storage unit in lieu of the remarking action otherwise required. Each notice shall indicate the change, the authority for the action, the date of the action, and the storage

units to which it applies. Items withdrawn from such storage units shall be promptly remarked. However, when information subject to a posted downgrading or declassification notice is withdrawn from one storage unit solely for transfer to another, or a storage unit containing such information is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may be made without remarking if the notice is attached to or remains with each shipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreign Relations Series. In order to permit the State Department editors of Foreign Relations of the United States to meet their mandated goal of publishing 20 years after the event, NASA shall assist these editors by facilitating access to appropriate classified materials in its custody and by expediting declassification review of items from its files selected for publication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]
