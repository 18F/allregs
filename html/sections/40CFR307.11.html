However, a potential claimant may elect to comply  with the provisions of this part, rather than the terms and conditions  of a PDD issued prior to the effective date of this part, if he so  chooses. Written notice of this election must be provided to EPA by the  potential claimant prior to such provision taking effect, but not later  than the time of the submittal of any claim to EPA. EPA will provide a  written acknowledgement of the potential claimant's election and may  revise the PDD as appropriate.</p>
