                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offer to sell. Where an owner has submitted a second notice of  intent under Sec. 248.133 for the purpose of transferring the project to  a qualified purchaser, and the transfer preservation rent does not  exceed the Federal cost limit, the owner shall offer the housing for  transfer as provided in this section. The owner shall not be obligated  to accept any offer made under this section, but may instead elect to  retain the project and receive incentives under Sec. 248.145.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification of qualified purchasers. Upon receipt of a second  notice of intent to transfer the project to a qualified purchaser, the  Commissioner shall notify potential qualified purchasers of the  availability of the project for sale, and of the names and addresses of  the owner, or of a person representing the owner in the sale of the  project, by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mailing notices to non-profit organizations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Placing notices in the major local newspaper(s) in the  jurisdiction in which the project is located;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mailing notices to clearinghouse networks; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Using any other means of notification which the Commissioner  determines would be effective to notify potential qualified purchasers  of the sale of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Right of first offer to priority purchasers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the 6-month  period beginning on the date of receipt by the Commissioner of a second  notice of intent under Sec. 248.133, the owner may accept a bona fide  offer only from:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A resident council intending to purchase the project under  Sec. Sec. 248.173 or 248.175, which has met the requirements for tenant  support, pursuant to those sections;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A resident council intending to purchase the project and retain  it as rental housing, which has the support of a majority of the  tenants; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A community-based nonprofit organization which has the support  of a majority of the tenants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no bona fide offer to purchase the project is made and  accepted during or at the end of the 6-month period specified in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner may offer to sell the  project during the next 6 months to any priority purchasers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If no bona fide offer to purchase the project is made and  accepted during or at the end of the 6-month period specified in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the owner may offer to sell the  project during the 3 months immediately following that period only to  qualified purchasers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Purchase price. The sale price, including assumption of the debt  on the federally-assisted mortgage(s), or the amount of the debt on the  federally-assisted mortgage(s) that the project is taken subject to, may  not exceed the transfer preservation value of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expression of interest. Any priority purchaser seeking to make  an offer during the 6-month periods specified in paragraph (c) of this  section shall, and other qualified purchasers may, submit written notice  thereof to the Commissioner. Such notice, if made by a priority  purchaser seeking to make an offer during either 6-month priority  purchaser marketing period, shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement identifying the priority purchaser as a State or  local government agency, a nonprofit organization, or a resident  council;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of its articles of incorporation, charter and list of  officers and directors, if the purchaser is a nonprofit organization or  a resident council and in the case of a nonprofit organization, proof  that the organization is, or has applied to be, a tax exempt  organization in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 501(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement as to whether the purchaser is affiliated with any  other entity for purposes of purchasing the project and whether any Low  Income Housing Tax Credits may be awarded in connection with the  purchase of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information from the Commissioner. Within 30 days of receipt of  an expression of interest by a priority purchaser, the Commissioner  shall determine the status of the priority purchaser with respect to the  categories listed in paragraph (h) of this section, and provide such  purchaser with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of all possible assistance available from the Federal  Government to facilitate a transfer of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The appraisal reports for the project as submitted under  Sec. 248.111;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commissioner's determination as to the priority status of  the purchaser and as to whether the purchaser qualifies as a resident  council, community-based nonprofit organization or State or local  government entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A worksheet indicating the level of the earnest money deposit  required upon the submission of a bona fide offer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An acknowledgment of the purchaser's right to inspect the  project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other relevant financial information that the Commissioner  possesses concerning the project, including the information determined  under Sec. 248.121.  Within the same 30-day period, the Commissioner shall also notify the  owner of the purchaser's expression of interest and instruct the owner  to provide to the purchaser any information concerning the project that  the Commissioner deems relevant to the transfer of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Bona fide offer. A bona fide offer is an offer to purchase  eligible low-income housing at a sales price which does not exceed the  transfer preservation value of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bona fide offer must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A contract of sale signed by the purchaser, which states that  acceptance of the contract is contingent upon approval by the  Commissioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An earnest money deposit from every qualified purchaser equal  to the lesser of one percent of the transfer preservation value, $50,000  or $500 per unit, unless the purchaser is a resident council purchasing  the project under a resident homeownership plan under Sec. 248.173 or  Sec. 248.175, in which case the earnest money deposit shall be equal to  $200 per unit from 75% of the occupied units; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the purchaser is a resident council intending to purchase  the project pursuant to a resident homeownership plan, the information  required under Sec. 248.173(b); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the purchaser is a resident council intending to retain the  project as rental housing, or a community-based nonprofit and the offer  is submitted within the marketing period established in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section, a resolution of the resident council, or a petition  signed by tenants representing a majority of the units indicating their  support of the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An owner may waive the requirement of an earnest money deposit  or   agree to accept a smaller deposit for all qualified purchasers, except  resident councils who intend to purchase the project pursuant to a  resident homeownership plan under Sec. 248.173 or Sec. 248.175. In order  to be effective:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The waiver must be indicated in the second notice of intent  submitted under Sec. 248.133 and the waiver must apply equally to all  qualified purchasers, except resident councils who intend to purchase  the project pursuant to a resident homeownership plan under Sec. 248.173  or Sec. 248.175; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the second notice of intent has already been submitted, the  owner must submit to the Commissioner, in writing, its decision to waive  the earnest money deposit. The Commissioner shall notify all qualified  purchasers who have submitted an expression of interest under paragraph  (e) of this section that the owner has waived the earnest money deposit  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retention and acceptance of offers. The owner shall accept or  reject any bona fide offer within 30 days of receipt of such offer. For  an offer to be bona fide, it must meet the requirements of paragraph (g)  of this section, as well as be submitted to the owner within the  appropriate marketing period under paragraph (c) of this section. If an  owner rejects any offer, it must return the earnest money deposit to the  offeror at the time of rejection. A bona fide offer which is rejected by  the owner will still be considered a bona fide offer for purposes of  this section, even after the earnest money deposit has been returned. If  an owner decides to accept the offer at a later date, the purchaser may  renew the offer by resubmitting the earnest money deposit, if a deposit  had originally been required, within 30 days of notification of the  owner's acceptance of the offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Submission of offer to HUD. The purchaser shall submit the offer  to the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall review the offer which is  preliminarily accepted by the owner to determine whether it meets the  requirements of a bona fide offer. The Commissioner shall notify the  owner and purchaser, within 30 days after acceptance, whether the offer  meets such requirements. The owner's preliminary acceptance of any offer  pursuant to this section shall be conditional upon the Commissioner's  certification that the offer is bona fide. If the Commissioner  determines that the offer is not a bona fide offer, the offer will be  considered invalid for the purposes of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Submission of plan of action. Upon a determination by the  Commissioner that the offer is bona fide and final acceptance of such an  offer, the owner and purchaser shall jointly submit a plan of action to  the Commissioner pursuant to Sec. 248.135. The plan of action shall  include any request for assistance from the Commissioner for purposes of  transferring the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Requirements for plan of action approval. If the qualified  purchaser of the project is a resident council seeking to purchase the  project under a resident homeownership program, the Commissioner may  approve a plan of action only if the resident council's proposed  resident homeownership program meets the requirements under Sec. 248.173  or Sec. 248.175. For all other qualified purchasers, the Commissioner  may approve a plan of action submitted pursuant to this section only if  the plan of action meets the criteria listed in Sec. 248.145.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Failure to consummate sales transaction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the owner  accepts an offer from a priority purchaser during either of the two 6- month periods specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and before the  expiration of the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the  sales transaction either falls through or does not close within 90 days  after the Commissioner's approval of the plan of action, the owner  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately notify the Commissioner that the sale has fallen  through;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify any other purchaser that had submitted an offer to  purchase the project; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Resume holding the project open for sale for the remainder of  the time periods specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owner accepts an offer from a purchaser, and during the  3-month period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or  thereafter, the sales transaction either falls through or does not close  within 90 days after the Commissioner's approval of the plan of action,   the owner shall take the following steps:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immediately notify the Commissioner that the sale has fallen  through;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contact any other purchaser that had submitted an offer to  purchase the project and give such purchaser and any other qualified  purchaser 60 days from the date of notification to the Commissioner in  which to resubmit an offer to purchase the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At any time during the 60-day period the owner may accept an  offer submitted under paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an offer submitted during the 60-day period specified in  paragraph (l)(2) of this section is made and accepted, but the sale is  not consummated within 90 days of the Commissioner's approval of the  plan of action for reasons not attributable in whole or in part to the  owner, the owner may terminate the low-income affordability restrictions  through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with  the provisions of Sec. 248.165.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Assistance. Subject to the availability of amounts approved in  appropriation acts, the Commissioner shall, for approvable plans of  action, provide assistance sufficient to enable qualified purchasers to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquire the eligible low income housing project from the current  owner for a purchase price not greater than the transfer preservation  value of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay the debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage(s)  covering the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pay the debt service on any loan for the rehabilitation of the  project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Meet project operating expenses and establish adequate reserves  for the housing, and in the case of a priority purchaser, meet project  oversight costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Receive a distribution equal to an 8 percent annual return on  any actual cash investment made to acquire or rehabilitate the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a priority purchaser, receive reimbursement for  all reasonable transaction expenses associated with the acquisition,  loan closing and implementation of an approved plan of action; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In the case of an approved resident homeownership program, cover  the costs of training for the resident council, homeownership counseling  and training, the fees for the nonprofit entity or public agency working  with the resident council, if such entity or agency is approved by the  Commissioner, and costs related to relocation of tenants who elect to  move. Assistance for such costs, exclusive of relocation expenses, shall  not exceed $500 per unit or $200,000 for the project, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Incentives. The Commissioner may provide assistance for all  qualified purchasers under this subpart in the form of one or more of  the incentives authorized under Sec. 248.153. The incentives provided by  the Commissioner to any qualified purchaser may include an acquisition  loan under subpart E of part 241 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Grants to priority purchasers. The Commissioner may provide  assistance for priority purchasers under subpart B of this part in the  form of a grant for each unit in the project in an amount, as determined  by the Commissioner, that does not exceed the present value of the total  of the projected fair market rent for the next ten years, or such longer  period if additional assistance is necessary to cover the costs set  forth in paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Reimbursement of assistance. The Commissioner reserves the right  to seek reimbursement from a priority purchaser who, within ten years of  approval of a plan of action, becomes affiliated with or transfers the  project to any non-priority purchaser. The Commissioner shall be  entitled to receive reimbursement for the difference between the  assistance provided to the priority purchaser and the assistance that  would have been provided in the same circumstances to a non-priority  purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Seller financing. In order to finance the acquisition or  rehabilitation of a project under this section, a qualified purchaser  may receive take-back financing from the owner of the project. If the  purpose of the seller financing is to aid acquisition of the project,  the principal amount of such financing, together with an acquisition  loan provided under part 241 of this   chapter, may not exceed the transfer preservation equity of the project,  plus, in the case of priority purchasers, any expenses associated with  the acquisition, loan closing, and implementation of the plan of action.  If the purpose of the seller financing is to fund rehabilitation of the  project, the principal amount of such financing may not exceed the  equity requirements for a rehabilitation loan under Sec. 241.70 or  Sec. 219.305 of this chapter. The seller may not charge interest on any  seller financing at a rate in excess of that of the Federal acquisition  or rehabilitation loan.
