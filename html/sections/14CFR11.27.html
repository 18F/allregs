                                Sec. 11.27  Are there other ways FAA collects specific rulemaking
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, the FAA obtains advice and recommendations from rulemaking  advisory committees. One of these committees is the Aviation Rulemaking  Advisory Committee (ARAC), which is a formal standing committee  comprised of representatives of aviation associations and industry,  consumer groups, and interested individuals. In conducting its  activities, ARAC complies with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and  the direction of FAA. We task ARAC with providing us with recommended  rulemaking actions dealing with specific areas and problems. If we  accept an ARAC recommendation to change an FAA rule, we ordinarily  publish an NPRM using the procedures in this part. The FAA may establish  other rulemaking advisory committees as needed to focus on specific  issues for a limited period of time.</p>
