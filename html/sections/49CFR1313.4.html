Each transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The assigned alpha code of the filing carrier;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of summaries transmitted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or the credit card to be charged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal numbers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the information must include the credit card number and expiration date, and an authorized signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contract summary title page.

(1) The contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in Sec. Sec.  1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, completed. When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term ``Not Applicable'' (``NA'') shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in Sec.

If the change to the contract is only in confidential matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If ``not applicable'' is permitted in the original summary under Sec. Sec.  1313.6 through 1313.8 of this part, the amended summary may use ``not applicable''

with a notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as ``not applicable'' or ``no change'' where disclosure was required in the original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in the contract, whether amended or not.</p>
