                            <p class="depth0">On February 1, 1993, the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources submitted a plan for the establishment and implementation of the Small Business Assistance Program as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, as required by Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments. EPA approved the Small Business Assistance Program on March 6, 1995, and made it part of the Pennsylvania SIP. As with all components of the SIP, Pennsylvania must implement the program as submitted and approved by EPA.
