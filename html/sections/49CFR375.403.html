                                Sec. 375.403  How must I provide a binding estimate?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may provide a guaranteed binding estimate of the total shipment charges to the individual shipper, so long as it is provided for in your tariff. The individual shipper must pay the amount for the services included in your estimate. You must comply with the following 11 requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must base the binding estimate on the physical survey unless one of the exceptions provided in Sec. 375.401(a)(1) and (2) applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must provide the binding estimate in writing to the individual shipper or other person responsible for payment of the freight charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must retain a copy of each binding estimate as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must clearly indicate upon each binding estimate's face that the estimate is binding upon you and the individual shipper. Each binding estimate must also clearly indicate on its face that the charges shown apply only to those services specifically identified in the estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must clearly describe binding-estimate shipments and all services you are providing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If it appears an individual shipper has tendered additional household goods or requires additional services not identified in the binding estimate, you are not required to honor the estimate. If an agreement cannot be reached as to the price or service requirements for the additional goods or services, you are not required to service the shipment. However, if you do service the shipment, before loading the shipment you must do one of the following three things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reaffirm your binding estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Negotiate a revised written binding estimate accurately listing, in detail, the additional household goods or services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Agree with the individual shipper, in writing, that both of you will

consider the original binding estimate as a non-binding estimate subject to Sec. 375.405.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Once you load a shipment, failure to execute a new binding estimate or a non-binding estimate signifies you have reaffirmed the original binding estimate. You may not collect more than the amount of the original binding estimate, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(8) and (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If you believe additional services are necessary to properly service a shipment after the bill of lading has been issued, you must inform the individual shipper what the additional services are before performing those services. You must allow the shipper at least one hour to determine whether he or she wants the additional services performed. If the individual shipper agrees to pay for the additional services, you must execute a written attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract and have the individual shipper sign the written attachment. This may be done through fax transmissions; e-mail; overnight courier; or certified mail, return receipt requested. You must bill the individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days from delivery. If the individual shipper does not agree to pay the additional services, the carrier should perform only those additional services as are required to complete the delivery, and bill the individual shipper for the additional services after 30 days from delivery, except that you may collect at delivery charges for impracticable operations that do not exceed 15 percent of all other charges due at delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If the individual shipper requests additional services after the bill of lading has been issued, you must inform the individual shipper of the additional charges involved. You may require full payment at destination for these additional services and for 100 percent of the original binding estimate. If applicable, you also may require payment at delivery of charges for impracticable operations (as defined in your carrier tariff) not to exceed 15 percent of all other charges due at delivery. You must bill and collect from the individual shipper any applicable charges not collected at delivery in accordance with subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Failure to relinquish possession of a shipment upon the individual shipper's offer to pay the binding estimate amount (or, in the case of a partial delivery, a prorated percentage of the binding estimate as set forth in paragraph (a)(11) of this section) plus charges for any additional services requested by the shipper after the bill of lading has been issued and charges, if applicable, for impracticable operations (subject to a maximum amount as set forth in paragraph 9 of this section), constitutes a failure to transport a shipment with ``reasonable dispatch'' and subjects you to cargo delay claims pursuant to part 370 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> If you make only a partial delivery of the shipment, you may not demand upon delivery full payment of the binding estimate. You may demand only a prorated percentage of the binding estimate. The prorated percentage must be the percentage of the weight of that portion of the shipment delivered relative to the total weight of the shipment. For example, if you deliver only 2,500 pounds of a shipment weighing 5,000 pounds, you may demand payment at destination for only 50 percent of the binding estimate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In accordance with Sec. 375.401(a), you may impose a charge for providing a written binding estimate. If you do not provide a binding estimate to an individual shipper, you must provide a non-binding estimate in accordance with Sec. 375.405.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must retain a copy of the binding estimate for each move you perform for at least one year from the date you made the estimate and keep it as an attachment to be made an integral part of the bill of lading contract.
