                            <p class="depth0">The administrative law judge shall file with the Executive Secretary  a recommended decision on the fee application not later than 90 days  after the filing of the application or 30 days after the conclusion of  the hearing, whichever is later. The recommended decision shall include  written proposed findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility  and its status as a prevailing party and an explanation of the reasons  for any difference between the amount requested and the amount of the  recommended award. The recommended decision shall also include, if at  issue, proposed findings on whether the FDIC's position was  substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the  proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. The  administrative law judge shall file the record of the proceeding on the  fee application and, at the same time, serve upon each party a copy of  the recommended decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order.</p>
