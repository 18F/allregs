See section 3001(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 995).

Section 7476 provides a procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment by the Tax Court with respect to the initial or continuing qualification under subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Code of a retirement plan defined in section 7476(d), in the case of an actual controversy involving:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A determination by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification under such subchapter of such a plan, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A failure by the Internal Revenue Service to make a determination with respect to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such initial qualification of such a plan, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such continuing qualification of such a plan, if the controversy arises from a plan amendment or plan termination.

Under section 7476(d) the term ``retirement plan'' means a pension profitsharing, or stock bonus plan described in section 401(a), or a trust which is part of such a plan, an annuity plan described in section 403(a), or a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a). This procedure is available only to the employer, the plan administrator as defined in section 414(g), an employee who qualifies as an interested party as defined in this section, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, where such person has an actual controversy involving a determination described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. In the case of an application for such a determination, this procedure is available only if such determination or failure to make such determination is with respect to an application described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. In addition, in the case of such an application, if a petitioner was the applicant for the determination, the Tax Court may hold, under section 7476(b)(2), the filing of a pleading for a declaratory judgment to be premature unless the petitioner establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax

Court that such petitioner has caused the interested parties to be notified in accordance with this section and Sec. 1.7476.2</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interested parties--(1) In general.
