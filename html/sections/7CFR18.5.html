A complainant may designate in writing, an individual or an organization to represent him in the processing of his complaint, and is entitled to the advice of counsel at his expense at all stages of the proceeding. If the representative designated by the complainant is an employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or of a Cooperative Extension Service, such employee, as well as an employee-complainant, shall have a reasonable amount of official time with pay, if he is in a pay status, for the purpose of appearing at any hearing on the complaint or conciliation effort. The rights and privileges set forth in this paragraph shall also be available to any person whose alleged conduct is the cause of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where filed. The procedure shall clearly state the persons, and their locations, with whom complaints may be filed. It shall also state that complaints may be filed with the Secretary.

The hearing shall be conducted promptly during regular working hours in the county where the alleged discrimination occurred or at a time and place agreed to by the President and the complainant. The President, the complainant and any person whose alleged conduct is the cause of the complaint shall have the right to call and cross-examine witnesses under oath. The hearing shall be provided by the President, and shall be conducted by an impartial board or hearing officer who shall promptly submit a proposed decision including findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations for action to the President.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Decision by the President. The President shall review the entire file on the complaint, including the record of the hearing if a hearing was held, and shall promptly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remand to the hearing board or officer for further action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make a decision on the complaint; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Otherwise dispose of the complaint.
