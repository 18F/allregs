(1) The Secretary shall retain sole authority in distributing any disaster assistance funds made available under section 308(b) of the Act.

Any fishery resource used in computing the states' amount under the apportionment formula in Sec. 253.601(a) will qualify for funding under this section. The Federal share of the cost of any activity conducted under the disaster provision of the Act shall be limited to 75 percent of the total cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary shall retain sole authority in distributing any disaster assistance funds made available under section 308(b) of the Act.
