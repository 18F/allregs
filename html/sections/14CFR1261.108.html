                                Sec. 1261.108  Recovery from carriers, insurers, and other third parties.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. NASA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all  personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are  encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable  to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from NASA.  The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the  claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for personal  property loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these  procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Demand on carrier, contractor, warehouse owner/operator, or  insurer. When it appears that property has been damaged or lost under  circumstances in which a carrier, warehouse owner/operator, contractor  or insurer may be responsible, the claimant shall make a written demand  on such party, either before or after submitting a claim against NASA.  The Administrator or designee, if requested, will assist in making  demand on the third party. No such demand need be made if, in the  opinion of the Administrator or designee, it would be impracticable or  any recovery would be insignificant, or if circumstances preclude the  claimant from making timely demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action subsequent to demand. A copy of the demand and of any  related correspondence shall be submitted to the Administrator or  designee. If the carrier, insurer, or other third party offers a  settlement which is less than the amount of the demand, the claimant  shall consult with the Administrator or designee before accepting the  amount offered. The claimant shall also notify the Administrator or  designee promptly of any other action by a third party, including  settlement, partial settlement, or denial of liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of recovery. When the amount recovered from a  carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the  claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation  is allowable under this subpart. When the amount recovered is less than  such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the  recovery from the amount of total loss subject to the maximum set forth  in Sec. 1261.102.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transfer of rights. The claimant shall assign to the United  States, to the extent of any payment accepted on a claim, all rights,  title, and interest in any claim he/she may have against any carrier,  insurer, or other party arising out of the accident or incident on which  the claim against the United States is based. The claimant shall also,  upon request, furnish such evidence and other cooperation as may be  required to enable the United States to enforce the claim. After payment  on the claim by the United States, the claimant shall, upon receipt of  any payment from a carrier, insurer, or other party, notify the  Administrator or designee and pay the proceeds to the United States to  the extent required under the provisions of paragraph (d).</p>
