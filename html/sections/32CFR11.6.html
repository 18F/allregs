Paragraph (a)(6)(i)(C) of this section precludes this offense

This offense does

not include the incidental infliction of pain or suffering associated with the legitimate conduct of hostilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Severe ``mental pain or suffering'' is the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The threat of imminent death; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ``Prolonged mental harm'' is a harm of some sustained duration, though not necessarily permanent in nature, such as a clinically identifiable mental disorder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Paragraph (a)(11)(i)(C) of this section does not require a particular formal relationship between the accused and the victim. Rather, it precludes prosecution for pain or suffering consequent to a lawful military attack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Causing serious injury--(i) Elements. (A) The accused caused serious injury to the body or health of one or more persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements.

(A) The accused invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the accused with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The accused invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the accused with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The invasion was committed by force, threat of force or coercion, or was committed against a person incapable of giving consent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with armed conflict.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comments.

(A) Means of accomplishing paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section include, but are not limited to: providing arms, ammunition, supplies, money, other items or services to the enemy; harboring or protecting the enemy; or giving intelligence or other information to the enemy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Means of accomplishing paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section include, but are not limited to: providing arms, ammunition, supplies, money, other items or services to the enemy; harboring or protecting the enemy; or giving intelligence or other information to the enemy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The requirement that conduct be wrongful for this crime necessitates that the accused act without proper authority. For example, furnishing enemy combatants detained during hostilities with subsistence or quarters in accordance with applicable orders or policy is not aiding the enemy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requirement that conduct be wrongful for this crime may necessitate that, in the case of a lawful belligerent, the accused owe allegiance or some duty to the United States of America or to an ally or coalition partner. For example, citizenship, resident alien status, or a contractual relationship in or with the United States or an ally or coalition partner is sufficient to satisfy this requirement so long as the relationship existed at a time relevant to the offense alleged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Spying--(i) Elements.

His successful rejoining of his armed force constitutes a defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Perjury or false testimony--(i) Elements. (A) The accused testified at a military commission, in proceedings ancillary to a military commission, or provided information in a writing executed under an oath to tell the truth or a declaration acknowledging the applicability of penalties of perjury in connection with such proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements.

(A) The accused did an act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The accused did an act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The accused intended to influence, impede, or otherwise obstruct the due administration of justice; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The accused did such act in the case of a certain person against whom the accused had reason to believe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There were or would be proceedings before a military commission; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There was an ongoing investigation of offenses triable by military commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other forms of liability and related offenses. A person is criminally liable as a principal for a completed substantive offense if that person commits the offense (perpetrator), aids or abets the commission of the offense, solicits commission of the offense, or is otherwise responsible due to command responsibility. Such a person would be charged as a principal even if another individual more directly perpetrated the offense. In proving culpability, however, the below listed definitions and elements are applicable. Additionally, if a substantive offense was completed, a person may be criminally liable for the separate offense of accessory after the fact. If the substantive offense was not completed, a person may be criminally liable of the lesser-included offense of attempt or the separate offense of solicitation. Finally, regardless of whether the substantive offense was completed, a person may be criminally liable of the separate offense of conspiracy in addition to the substantive offense. Each element need not be specifically charged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Aiding or abetting--(i) Elements. (A) The accused committed an act that aided or abetted another person or entity in the commission of a substantive offense triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements. (A) The accused committed an act that aided or abetted another person or entity in the commission of a substantive offense triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The accused committed an act that aided or abetted another person or entity in the commission of a substantive offense triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such other person or entity committed or attempted to commit the substantive offense; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The accused intended to or knew that the act would aid or abet such other person or entity in the commission of the substantive offense or an associated criminal purpose or enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comments. (A) The term ``aided or abetted'' in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section includes: assisting, encouraging, advising, instigating, counseling, ordering, or procuring another to commit a substantive offense; assisting, encouraging, advising, counseling, or ordering another in the commission of a substantive offense; and in any other way facilitating the commission of a substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The term ``aided or abetted'' in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section includes: assisting, encouraging, advising, instigating, counseling, ordering, or procuring another to commit a substantive offense; assisting, encouraging, advising, counseling, or ordering another in the commission of a substantive offense; and in any other way facilitating the commission of a substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In some circumstances, inaction may render one liable as an aider or abettor. If a person has a legal duty to prevent or thwart the commission of a substantive offense, but does not do so, that person may be considered to have aided or abetted the commission of the offense if such noninterference is intended to and does operate as an aid or encouragement to the actual perpetrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An accused charged with aiding or abetting should be charged with the related substantive offense as a principal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Solicitation--(i) Elements. (A) The accused solicited, ordered, induced, or advised a certain person or persons to commit one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements.

(A) The offense is complete when a solicitation is made or advice is given with the specific wrongful intent to induce a person or persons to commit any offense triable by military commission. It is not necessary that the person or persons solicited, ordered, induced, advised, or assisted agree to or act upon the solicitation or advice. If the offense solicited is actually committed, however, the accused is liable under the law of armed conflict for the substantive offense. An accused should not be convicted of both solicitation and the substantive offense solicited if criminal liability for the substantive offense is based upon the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The offense is complete when a solicitation is made or advice is given with the specific wrongful intent to induce a person or persons to commit any offense triable by military commission.

An accused should not be convicted of both solicitation and the substantive offense solicited if criminal liability for the substantive offense is based upon the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Solicitation may be by means other than speech or writing. Any act or conduct that reasonably may be

construed as a serious request, order, inducement, advice, or offer of assistance to commit any offense triable by military commission may constitute solicitation. It is not necessary that the accused act alone in the solicitation, order, inducement, advising, or assistance. The accused may act through other persons in committing this offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An accused charged with solicitation of a completed substantive offense should be charged for the substantive offense as a principal. An accused charged with solicitation of an uncompleted offense should be charged for the separate offense of solicitation. Solicitation is not a lesser-included offense of the related substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Command/superior responsibility--perpetrating--(i) Elements. (A) The accused had command and control, or effective authority and control, over one or more subordinates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements.

(A) The phrase ``effective authority and control'' in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section includes the concept of relative authority over the subject matter or activities associated with the perpetrator's conduct. This may be relevant to a civilian superior who should not be held responsible for the behavior of subordinates involved in activities that have no relationship to such superior's sphere of authority.

(A) The phrase, ``effective authority and control'' in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section includes the concept of relative authority over the subject matter or activities associated with the perpetrator's conduct.

Such commander or superior should be charged for the separate offense of failing to submit the matter for investigation and/or prosecution as detailed in these elements. This offense is not a lesser-included offense of the related substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Accessory after the fact--(i) Elements.

Accessory after the fact should be charged separately from the related substantive offense. It is not a lesser-included offense of the related substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conspiracy--(i) Elements. (A) The accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission or otherwise joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose that involved, at least in part, the commission or intended commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements. (A) The accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission or otherwise joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose that involved, at least in part, the commission or intended commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The accused entered into an agreement with one or more persons to commit one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission or otherwise joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose that involved, at least in part, the commission or intended commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The accused knew the unlawful purpose of the agreement or the common criminal purpose of the enterprise and joined in it willfully, that is, with the intent to further the unlawful purpose; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> One of the conspirators or enterprise members, during the existence of the agreement or enterprise, knowingly committed an overt act in order to accomplish some objective or purpose of the agreement or enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Comments. (A) Two or more persons are required in order to have a conspiracy. Knowledge of the identity of co-conspirators and their particular connection with the agreement or enterprise need not be established. A person may be guilty of conspiracy although incapable of committing the intended offense. The joining of another conspirator after the conspiracy has been established does not create a new conspiracy or affect the status of the other conspirators. The agreement or common criminal purpose in a conspiracy need not be in any particular form or manifested in any formal words.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Two or more persons are required in order to have a conspiracy.

The agreement or common criminal purpose in a conspiracy need not be in any particular form or manifested in any formal words.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The agreement or enterprise must, at least in part, involve the commission or intended commission of one or more substantive offenses triable by military commission. A single conspiracy may embrace multiple criminal objectives. The agreement need not include knowledge that any relevant offense is in fact ``triable by military commission.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The overt act must be done by one or more of the conspirators, but not necessarily the accused, and it must be done to effectuate the object of the conspiracy or in furtherance of the common criminal purpose. The accused need not have entered the agreement or criminal enterprise at the time of the overt act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The overt act need not be in itself criminal, but it must advance the purpose of the conspiracy. It is not essential that any substantive offense be committed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Each conspirator is liable for all offenses committed pursuant to or in furtherance of the conspiracy by any of the co-conspirators, after such conspirator has joined the conspiracy and while the conspiracy continues and such conspirator remains a party to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A party to the conspiracy who withdraws from or abandons the agreement or enterprise before the commission of an overt act by any conspirator is not guilty of conspiracy. An effective withdrawal or abandonment must consist of affirmative conduct that is wholly inconsistent with adherence to the unlawful agreement or common criminal purpose and that shows that the party has severed all connection with the conspiracy. A conspirator who effectively withdraws from or abandons the conspiracy after the performance of an overt act by one of the conspirators remains guilty of conspiracy and of any offenses committed pursuant to the conspiracy up to the time of the withdrawal or abandonment. The withdrawal of a conspirator from the conspiracy does not affect the status of the remaining members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> That the object of the conspiracy was impossible to effect is not a defense to this offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Conspiracy to commit an offense is a separate and distinct offense from any offense committed pursuant to or in furtherance of the conspiracy, and both the conspiracy and any related offense may be charged, tried, and punished separately. Conspiracy should be charged separately from the related substantive offense. It is not a lesser-

included offense of the substantive offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Attempt--(i) Elements. (A) The accused committed an act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Elements.

This intent need not involve knowledge that the offense is in fact ``triable by military commission.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To constitute an attempt there must be a specific intent to commit the offense accompanied by an act that tends to accomplish the unlawful purpose. This intent need not involve knowledge that the offense is in fact ``triable by military commission.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Preparation consists of devising or arranging means or measures apparently necessary for the commission of the offense. The act need not be the last act essential to the consummation of the offense. The combination of specific intent to commit an offense, plus the commission of an act apparently tending to further its accomplishment, constitutes the offense of attempt. Failure to complete the offense, whatever the cause, is not a defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A person who purposely engages in conduct that would constitute the offense if the attendant circumstances were as that person believed them to be is guilty of an attempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person voluntarily and completely abandoned the intended offense, solely because of the person's own sense that it was wrong, prior to the completion of the substantive offense. The voluntary abandonment defense is not allowed if the abandonment results, in whole or in part, from other reasons, for example, the person feared detection or apprehension, decided to await a better opportunity for success, was unable to complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or unexpected resistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Attempt is a lesser-included offense of any substantive offense triable by military commission and need not be charged separately. An accused may be charged with attempt without being charged with the substantive offense.</p>
